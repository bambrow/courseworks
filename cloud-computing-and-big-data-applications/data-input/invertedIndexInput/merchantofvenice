67	
68	ACT I
69	
70	
71	
72	SCENE I	Venice. A street.
73	
74	
75	[Enter ANTONIO, SALARINO, and SALANIO]
76	
77	ANTONIO	In sooth, I know not why I am so sad:
78	It wearies me; you say it wearies you;
79	But how I caught it, found it, or came by it,
80	What stuff 'tis made of, whereof it is born,
81	I am to learn;
82	And such a want-wit sadness makes of me,
83	That I have much ado to know myself.
84	
85	SALARINO	Your mind is tossing on the ocean;
86	There, where your argosies with portly sail,
87	Like signiors and rich burghers on the flood,
88	Or, as it were, the pageants of the sea,
89	Do overpeer the petty traffickers,
90	That curtsy to them, do them reverence,
91	As they fly by them with their woven wings.
92	
93	SALANIO	Believe me, sir, had I such venture forth,
94	The better part of my affections would
95	Be with my hopes abroad. I should be still
96	Plucking the grass, to know where sits the wind,
97	Peering in maps for ports and piers and roads;
98	And every object that might make me fear
99	Misfortune to my ventures, out of doubt
100	Would make me sad.
101	
102	SALARINO	                  My wind cooling my broth
103	Would blow me to an ague, when I thought
104	What harm a wind too great at sea might do.
105	I should not see the sandy hour-glass run,
106	But I should think of shallows and of flats,
107	And see my wealthy Andrew dock'd in sand,
108	Vailing her high-top lower than her ribs
109	To kiss her burial. Should I go to church
110	And see the holy edifice of stone,
111	And not bethink me straight of dangerous rocks,
112	Which touching but my gentle vessel's side,
113	Would scatter all her spices on the stream,
114	Enrobe the roaring waters with my silks,
115	And, in a word, but even now worth this,
116	And now worth nothing? Shall I have the thought
117	To think on this, and shall I lack the thought
118	That such a thing bechanced would make me sad?
119	But tell not me; I know, Antonio
120	Is sad to think upon his merchandise.
121	
122	ANTONIO	Believe me, no: I thank my fortune for it,
123	My ventures are not in one bottom trusted,
124	Nor to one place; nor is my whole estate
125	Upon the fortune of this present year:
126	Therefore my merchandise makes me not sad.
127	
128	SALARINO	Why, then you are in love.
129	
130	ANTONIO	Fie, fie!
131	
132	SALARINO	Not in love neither? Then let us say you are sad,
133	Because you are not merry: and 'twere as easy
134	For you to laugh and leap and say you are merry,
135	Because you are not sad. Now, by two-headed Janus,
136	Nature hath framed strange fellows in her time:
137	Some that will evermore peep through their eyes
138	And laugh like parrots at a bag-piper,
139	And other of such vinegar aspect
140	That they'll not show their teeth in way of smile,
141	Though Nestor swear the jest be laughable.
142	
143	[Enter BASSANIO, LORENZO, and GRATIANO]
144	
145	SALANIO	Here comes Bassanio, your most noble kinsman,
146	Gratiano and Lorenzo. Fare ye well:
147	We leave you now with better company.
148	
149	SALARINO	I would have stay'd till I had made you merry,
150	If worthier friends had not prevented me.
151	
152	ANTONIO	Your worth is very dear in my regard.
153	I take it, your own business calls on you
154	And you embrace the occasion to depart.
155	
156	SALARINO	Good morrow, my good lords.
157	
158	BASSANIO	Good signiors both, when shall we laugh? say, when?
159	You grow exceeding strange: must it be so?
160	
161	SALARINO	We'll make our leisures to attend on yours.
162	
163	[Exeunt Salarino and Salanio]
164	
165	LORENZO	My Lord Bassanio, since you have found Antonio,
166	We two will leave you: but at dinner-time,
167	I pray you, have in mind where we must meet.
168	
169	BASSANIO	I will not fail you.
170	
171	GRATIANO	You look not well, Signior Antonio;
172	You have too much respect upon the world:
173	They lose it that do buy it with much care:
174	Believe me, you are marvellously changed.
175	
176	ANTONIO	I hold the world but as the world, Gratiano;
177	A stage where every man must play a part,
178	And mine a sad one.
179	
180	GRATIANO	Let me play the fool:
181	With mirth and laughter let old wrinkles come,
182	And let my liver rather heat with wine
183	Than my heart cool with mortifying groans.
184	Why should a man, whose blood is warm within,
185	Sit like his grandsire cut in alabaster?
186	Sleep when he wakes and creep into the jaundice
187	By being peevish? I tell thee what, Antonio--
188	I love thee, and it is my love that speaks--
189	There are a sort of men whose visages
190	Do cream and mantle like a standing pond,
191	And do a wilful stillness entertain,
192	With purpose to be dress'd in an opinion
193	Of wisdom, gravity, profound conceit,
194	As who should say 'I am Sir Oracle,
195	And when I ope my lips let no dog bark!'
196	O my Antonio, I do know of these
197	That therefore only are reputed wise
198	For saying nothing; when, I am very sure,
199	If they should speak, would almost damn those ears,
200	Which, hearing them, would call their brothers fools.
201	I'll tell thee more of this another time:
202	But fish not, with this melancholy bait,
203	For this fool gudgeon, this opinion.
204	Come, good Lorenzo. Fare ye well awhile:
205	I'll end my exhortation after dinner.
206	
207	LORENZO	Well, we will leave you then till dinner-time:
208	I must be one of these same dumb wise men,
209	For Gratiano never lets me speak.
210	
211	GRATIANO	Well, keep me company but two years moe,
212	Thou shalt not know the sound of thine own tongue.
213	
214	ANTONIO	Farewell: I'll grow a talker for this gear.
215	
216	GRATIANO	Thanks, i' faith, for silence is only commendable
217	In a neat's tongue dried and a maid not vendible.
218	
219	[Exeunt GRATIANO and LORENZO]
220	
221	ANTONIO	Is that any thing now?
222	
223	BASSANIO	Gratiano speaks an infinite deal of nothing, more
224	than any man in all Venice. His reasons are as two
225	grains of wheat hid in two bushels of chaff: you
226	shall seek all day ere you find them, and when you
227	have them, they are not worth the search.
228	
229	ANTONIO	Well, tell me now what lady is the same
230	To whom you swore a secret pilgrimage,
231	That you to-day promised to tell me of?
232	
233	BASSANIO	'Tis not unknown to you, Antonio,
234	How much I have disabled mine estate,
235	By something showing a more swelling port
236	Than my faint means would grant continuance:
237	Nor do I now make moan to be abridged
238	From such a noble rate; but my chief care
239	Is to come fairly off from the great debts
240	Wherein my time something too prodigal
241	Hath left me gaged. To you, Antonio,
242	I owe the most, in money and in love,
243	And from your love I have a warranty
244	To unburden all my plots and purposes
245	How to get clear of all the debts I owe.
246	
247	ANTONIO	I pray you, good Bassanio, let me know it;
248	And if it stand, as you yourself still do,
249	Within the eye of honour, be assured,
250	My purse, my person, my extremest means,
251	Lie all unlock'd to your occasions.
252	
253	BASSANIO	In my school-days, when I had lost one shaft,
254	I shot his fellow of the self-same flight
255	The self-same way with more advised watch,
256	To find the other forth, and by adventuring both
257	I oft found both: I urge this childhood proof,
258	Because what follows is pure innocence.
259	I owe you much, and, like a wilful youth,
260	That which I owe is lost; but if you please
261	To shoot another arrow that self way
262	Which you did shoot the first, I do not doubt,
263	As I will watch the aim, or to find both
264	Or bring your latter hazard back again
265	And thankfully rest debtor for the first.
266	
267	ANTONIO	You know me well, and herein spend but time
268	To wind about my love with circumstance;
269	And out of doubt you do me now more wrong
270	In making question of my uttermost
271	Than if you had made waste of all I have:
272	Then do but say to me what I should do
273	That in your knowledge may by me be done,
274	And I am prest unto it: therefore, speak.
275	
276	BASSANIO	In Belmont is a lady richly left;
277	And she is fair, and, fairer than that word,
278	Of wondrous virtues: sometimes from her eyes
279	I did receive fair speechless messages:
280	Her name is Portia, nothing undervalued
281	To Cato's daughter, Brutus' Portia:
282	Nor is the wide world ignorant of her worth,
283	For the four winds blow in from every coast
284	Renowned suitors, and her sunny locks
285	Hang on her temples like a golden fleece;
286	Which makes her seat of Belmont Colchos' strand,
287	And many Jasons come in quest of her.
288	O my Antonio, had I but the means
289	To hold a rival place with one of them,
290	I have a mind presages me such thrift,
291	That I should questionless be fortunate!
292	
293	ANTONIO	Thou know'st that all my fortunes are at sea;
294	Neither have I money nor commodity
295	To raise a present sum: therefore go forth;
296	Try what my credit can in Venice do:
297	That shall be rack'd, even to the uttermost,
298	To furnish thee to Belmont, to fair Portia.
299	Go, presently inquire, and so will I,
300	Where money is, and I no question make
301	To have it of my trust or for my sake.
302	
303	[Exeunt]

308	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
309	
310	
311	ACT I
312	
313	
314	
315	SCENE II: Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
316	
317	
318	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]
319	
320	PORTIA	By my troth, Nerissa, my little body is aweary of
321	this great world.
322	
323	NERISSA	You would be, sweet madam, if your miseries were in
324	the same abundance as your good fortunes are: and
325	yet, for aught I see, they are as sick that surfeit
326	with too much as they that starve with nothing. It
327	is no mean happiness therefore, to be seated in the
328	mean: superfluity comes sooner by white hairs, but
329	competency lives longer.
330	
331	PORTIA	Good sentences and well pronounced.
332	
333	NERISSA	They would be better, if well followed.
334	
335	PORTIA	If to do were as easy as to know what were good to
336	do, chapels had been churches and poor men's
337	cottages princes' palaces. It is a good divine that
338	follows his own instructions: I can easier teach
339	twenty what were good to be done, than be one of the
340	twenty to follow mine own teaching. The brain may
341	devise laws for the blood, but a hot temper leaps
342	o'er a cold decree: such a hare is madness the
343	youth, to skip o'er the meshes of good counsel the
344	cripple. But this reasoning is not in the fashion to
345	choose me a husband. O me, the word 'choose!' I may
346	neither choose whom I would nor refuse whom I
347	dislike; so is the will of a living daughter curbed
348	by the will of a dead father. Is it not hard,
349	Nerissa, that I cannot choose one nor refuse none?
350	
351	NERISSA	Your father was ever virtuous; and holy men at their
352	death have good inspirations: therefore the lottery,
353	that he hath devised in these three chests of gold,
354	silver and lead, whereof who chooses his meaning
355	chooses you, will, no doubt, never be chosen by any
356	rightly but one who shall rightly love. But what
357	warmth is there in your affection towards any of
358	these princely suitors that are already come?
359	
360	PORTIA	I pray thee, over-name them; and as thou namest
361	them, I will describe them; and, according to my
362	description, level at my affection.
363	
364	NERISSA	First, there is the Neapolitan prince.
365	
366	PORTIA	Ay, that's a colt indeed, for he doth nothing but
367	talk of his horse; and he makes it a great
368	appropriation to his own good parts, that he can
369	shoe him himself. I am much afeard my lady his
370	mother played false with a smith.
371	
372	NERISSA	Then there is the County Palatine.
373	
374	PORTIA	He doth nothing but frown, as who should say 'If you
375	will not have me, choose:' he hears merry tales and
376	smiles not: I fear he will prove the weeping
377	philosopher when he grows old, being so full of
378	unmannerly sadness in his youth. I had rather be
379	married to a death's-head with a bone in his mouth
380	than to either of these. God defend me from these
381	two!
382	
383	NERISSA	How say you by the French lord, Monsieur Le Bon?
384	
385	PORTIA	God made him, and therefore let him pass for a man.
386	In truth, I know it is a sin to be a mocker: but,
387	he! why, he hath a horse better than the
388	Neapolitan's, a better bad habit of frowning than
389	the Count Palatine; he is every man in no man; if a
390	throstle sing, he falls straight a capering: he will
391	fence with his own shadow: if I should marry him, I
392	should marry twenty husbands. If he would despise me
393	I would forgive him, for if he love me to madness, I
394	shall never requite him.
395	
396	NERISSA	What say you, then, to Falconbridge, the young baron
397	of England?
398	
399	PORTIA	You know I say nothing to him, for he understands
400	not me, nor I him: he hath neither Latin, French,
401	nor Italian, and you will come into the court and
402	swear that I have a poor pennyworth in the English.
403	He is a proper man's picture, but, alas, who can
404	converse with a dumb-show? How oddly he is suited!
405	I think he bought his doublet in Italy, his round
406	hose in France, his bonnet in Germany and his
407	behavior every where.
408	
409	NERISSA	What think you of the Scottish lord, his neighbour?
410	
411	PORTIA	That he hath a neighbourly charity in him, for he
412	borrowed a box of the ear of the Englishman and
413	swore he would pay him again when he was able: I
414	think the Frenchman became his surety and sealed
415	under for another.
416	
417	NERISSA	How like you the young German, the Duke of Saxony's nephew?
418	
419	PORTIA	Very vilely in the morning, when he is sober, and
420	most vilely in the afternoon, when he is drunk: when
421	he is best, he is a little worse than a man, and
422	when he is worst, he is little better than a beast:
423	and the worst fall that ever fell, I hope I shall
424	make shift to go without him.
425	
426	NERISSA	If he should offer to choose, and choose the right
427	casket, you should refuse to perform your father's
428	will, if you should refuse to accept him.
429	
430	PORTIA	Therefore, for fear of the worst, I pray thee, set a
431	deep glass of rhenish wine on the contrary casket,
432	for if the devil be within and that temptation
433	without, I know he will choose it. I will do any
434	thing, Nerissa, ere I'll be married to a sponge.
435	
436	NERISSA	You need not fear, lady, the having any of these
437	lords: they have acquainted me with their
438	determinations; which is, indeed, to return to their
439	home and to trouble you with no more suit, unless
440	you may be won by some other sort than your father's
441	imposition depending on the caskets.
442	
443	PORTIA	If I live to be as old as Sibylla, I will die as
444	chaste as Diana, unless I be obtained by the manner
445	of my father's will. I am glad this parcel of wooers
446	are so reasonable, for there is not one among them
447	but I dote on his very absence, and I pray God grant
448	them a fair departure.
449	
450	NERISSA	Do you not remember, lady, in your father's time, a
451	Venetian, a scholar and a soldier, that came hither
452	in company of the Marquis of Montferrat?
453	
454	PORTIA	Yes, yes, it was Bassanio; as I think, he was so called.
455	
456	NERISSA	True, madam: he, of all the men that ever my foolish
457	eyes looked upon, was the best deserving a fair lady.
458	
459	PORTIA	I remember him well, and I remember him worthy of
460	thy praise.
461	
462	[Enter a Serving-man]
463	
464	How now! what news?
465	
466	Servant	The four strangers seek for you, madam, to take
467	their leave: and there is a forerunner come from a
468	fifth, the Prince of Morocco, who brings word the
469	prince his master will be here to-night.
470	
471	PORTIA	If I could bid the fifth welcome with so good a
472	heart as I can bid the other four farewell, I should
473	be glad of his approach: if he have the condition
474	of a saint and the complexion of a devil, I had
475	rather he should shrive me than wive me. Come,
476	Nerissa. Sirrah, go before.
477	Whiles we shut the gates
478	upon one wooer, another knocks at the door.
479	
480	[Exeunt]

485	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
486	
487	
488	ACT I
489	
490	
491	
492	SCENE III	Venice. A public place.
493	
494	
495	[Enter BASSANIO and SHYLOCK]
496	
497	SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats; well.
498	
499	BASSANIO	Ay, sir, for three months.
500	
501	SHYLOCK	For three months; well.
502	
503	BASSANIO	For the which, as I told you, Antonio shall be bound.
504	
505	SHYLOCK	Antonio shall become bound; well.
506	
507	BASSANIO	May you stead me? will you pleasure me? shall I
508	know your answer?
509	
510	SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats for three months and Antonio bound.
511	
512	BASSANIO	Your answer to that.
513	
514	SHYLOCK	Antonio is a good man.
515	
516	BASSANIO	Have you heard any imputation to the contrary?
517	
518	SHYLOCK	Oh, no, no, no, no: my meaning in saying he is a
519	good man is to have you understand me that he is
520	sufficient. Yet his means are in supposition: he
521	hath an argosy bound to Tripolis, another to the
522	Indies; I understand moreover, upon the Rialto, he
523	hath a third at Mexico, a fourth for England, and
524	other ventures he hath, squandered abroad. But ships
525	are but boards, sailors but men: there be land-rats
526	and water-rats, water-thieves and land-thieves, I
527	mean pirates, and then there is the peril of waters,
528	winds and rocks. The man is, notwithstanding,
529	sufficient. Three thousand ducats; I think I may
530	take his bond.
531	
532	BASSANIO	Be assured you may.
533	
534	SHYLOCK	I will be assured I may; and, that I may be assured,
535	I will bethink me. May I speak with Antonio?
536	
537	BASSANIO	If it please you to dine with us.
538	
539	SHYLOCK	Yes, to smell pork; to eat of the habitation which
540	your prophet the Nazarite conjured the devil into. I
541	will buy with you, sell with you, talk with you,
542	walk with you, and so following, but I will not eat
543	with you, drink with you, nor pray with you. What
544	news on the Rialto? Who is he comes here?
545	
546	[Enter ANTONIO]
547	
548	BASSANIO	This is Signior Antonio.
549	
550	SHYLOCK	[Aside]  How like a fawning publican he looks!
551	I hate him for he is a Christian,
552	But more for that in low simplicity
553	He lends out money gratis and brings down
554	The rate of usance here with us in Venice.
555	If I can catch him once upon the hip,
556	I will feed fat the ancient grudge I bear him.
557	He hates our sacred nation, and he rails,
558	Even there where merchants most do congregate,
559	On me, my bargains and my well-won thrift,
560	Which he calls interest. Cursed be my tribe,
561	If I forgive him!
562	
563	BASSANIO	                  Shylock, do you hear?
564	
565	SHYLOCK	I am debating of my present store,
566	And, by the near guess of my memory,
567	I cannot instantly raise up the gross
568	Of full three thousand ducats. What of that?
569	Tubal, a wealthy Hebrew of my tribe,
570	Will furnish me. But soft! how many months
571	Do you desire?
572	
573	[To ANTONIO]
574	
575	Rest you fair, good signior;
576	Your worship was the last man in our mouths.
577	
578	ANTONIO	Shylock, although I neither lend nor borrow
579	By taking nor by giving of excess,
580	Yet, to supply the ripe wants of my friend,
581	I'll break a custom. Is he yet possess'd
582	How much ye would?
583	
584	SHYLOCK	                  Ay, ay, three thousand ducats.
585	
586	ANTONIO	And for three months.
587	
588	SHYLOCK	I had forgot; three months; you told me so.
589	Well then, your bond; and let me see; but hear you;
590	Methought you said you neither lend nor borrow
591	Upon advantage.
592	
593	ANTONIO	                  I do never use it.
594	
595	SHYLOCK	When Jacob grazed his uncle Laban's sheep--
596	This Jacob from our holy Abram was,
597	As his wise mother wrought in his behalf,
598	The third possessor; ay, he was the third--
599	
600	ANTONIO	And what of him? did he take interest?
601	
602	SHYLOCK	No, not take interest, not, as you would say,
603	Directly interest: mark what Jacob did.
604	When Laban and himself were compromised
605	That all the eanlings which were streak'd and pied
606	Should fall as Jacob's hire, the ewes, being rank,
607	In the end of autumn turned to the rams,
608	And, when the work of generation was
609	Between these woolly breeders in the act,
610	The skilful shepherd peel'd me certain wands,
611	And, in the doing of the deed of kind,
612	He stuck them up before the fulsome ewes,
613	Who then conceiving did in eaning time
614	Fall parti-colour'd lambs, and those were Jacob's.
615	This was a way to thrive, and he was blest:
616	And thrift is blessing, if men steal it not.
617	
618	ANTONIO	This was a venture, sir, that Jacob served for;
619	A thing not in his power to bring to pass,
620	But sway'd and fashion'd by the hand of heaven.
621	Was this inserted to make interest good?
622	Or is your gold and silver ewes and rams?
623	
624	SHYLOCK	I cannot tell; I make it breed as fast:
625	But note me, signior.
626	
627	ANTONIO	Mark you this, Bassanio,
628	The devil can cite Scripture for his purpose.
629	An evil soul producing holy witness
630	Is like a villain with a smiling cheek,
631	A goodly apple rotten at the heart:
632	O, what a goodly outside falsehood hath!
633	
634	SHYLOCK	Three thousand ducats; 'tis a good round sum.
635	Three months from twelve; then, let me see; the rate--
636	
637	ANTONIO	Well, Shylock, shall we be beholding to you?
638	
639	SHYLOCK	Signior Antonio, many a time and oft
640	In the Rialto you have rated me
641	About my moneys and my usances:
642	Still have I borne it with a patient shrug,
643	For sufferance is the badge of all our tribe.
644	You call me misbeliever, cut-throat dog,
645	And spit upon my Jewish gaberdine,
646	And all for use of that which is mine own.
647	Well then, it now appears you need my help:
648	Go to, then; you come to me, and you say
649	'Shylock, we would have moneys:' you say so;
650	You, that did void your rheum upon my beard
651	And foot me as you spurn a stranger cur
652	Over your threshold: moneys is your suit
653	What should I say to you? Should I not say
654	'Hath a dog money? is it possible
655	A cur can lend three thousand ducats?' Or
656	Shall I bend low and in a bondman's key,
657	With bated breath and whispering humbleness, Say this;
658	'Fair sir, you spit on me on Wednesday last;
659	You spurn'd me such a day; another time
660	You call'd me dog; and for these courtesies
661	I'll lend you thus much moneys'?
662	
663	ANTONIO	I am as like to call thee so again,
664	To spit on thee again, to spurn thee too.
665	If thou wilt lend this money, lend it not
666	As to thy friends; for when did friendship take
667	A breed for barren metal of his friend?
668	But lend it rather to thine enemy,
669	Who, if he break, thou mayst with better face
670	Exact the penalty.
671	
672	SHYLOCK	                  Why, look you, how you storm!
673	I would be friends with you and have your love,
674	Forget the shames that you have stain'd me with,
675	Supply your present wants and take no doit
676	Of usance for my moneys, and you'll not hear me:
677	This is kind I offer.
678	
679	
680	BASSANIO	This were kindness.
681	
682	SHYLOCK	This kindness will I show.
683	Go with me to a notary, seal me there
684	Your single bond; and, in a merry sport,
685	If you repay me not on such a day,
686	In such a place, such sum or sums as are
687	Express'd in the condition, let the forfeit
688	Be nominated for an equal pound
689	Of your fair flesh, to be cut off and taken
690	In what part of your body pleaseth me.
691	
692	ANTONIO	Content, i' faith: I'll seal to such a bond
693	And say there is much kindness in the Jew.
694	
695	BASSANIO	You shall not seal to such a bond for me:
696	I'll rather dwell in my necessity.
697	
698	ANTONIO	Why, fear not, man; I will not forfeit it:
699	Within these two months, that's a month before
700	This bond expires, I do expect return
701	Of thrice three times the value of this bond.
702	
703	SHYLOCK	O father Abram, what these Christians are,
704	Whose own hard dealings teaches them suspect
705	The thoughts of others! Pray you, tell me this;
706	If he should break his day, what should I gain
707	By the exaction of the forfeiture?
708	A pound of man's flesh taken from a man
709	Is not so estimable, profitable neither,
710	As flesh of muttons, beefs, or goats. I say,
711	To buy his favour, I extend this friendship:
712	If he will take it, so; if not, adieu;
713	And, for my love, I pray you wrong me not.
714	
715	ANTONIO	Yes Shylock, I will seal unto this bond.
716	
717	SHYLOCK	Then meet me forthwith at the notary's;
718	Give him direction for this merry bond,
719	And I will go and purse the ducats straight,
720	See to my house, left in the fearful guard
721	Of an unthrifty knave, and presently
722	I will be with you.
723	
724	ANTONIO	Hie thee, gentle Jew.
725	
726	[Exit Shylock]
727	
728	The Hebrew will turn Christian: he grows kind.
729	
730	BASSANIO	I like not fair terms and a villain's mind.
731	
732	ANTONIO	Come on: in this there can be no dismay;
733	My ships come home a month before the day.
734	
735	[Exeunt]

740	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
741	
742	
743	ACT II
744	
745	
746	
747	SCENE I	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
748	
749	
750	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF MOROCCO
751	and his train; PORTIA, NERISSA, and others
752	attending]
753	
754	MOROCCO	Mislike me not for my complexion,
755	The shadow'd livery of the burnish'd sun,
756	To whom I am a neighbour and near bred.
757	Bring me the fairest creature northward born,
758	Where Phoebus' fire scarce thaws the icicles,
759	And let us make incision for your love,
760	To prove whose blood is reddest, his or mine.
761	I tell thee, lady, this aspect of mine
762	Hath fear'd the valiant: by my love I swear
763	The best-regarded virgins of our clime
764	Have loved it too: I would not change this hue,
765	Except to steal your thoughts, my gentle queen.
766	
767	PORTIA	In terms of choice I am not solely led
768	By nice direction of a maiden's eyes;
769	Besides, the lottery of my destiny
770	Bars me the right of voluntary choosing:
771	But if my father had not scanted me
772	And hedged me by his wit, to yield myself
773	His wife who wins me by that means I told you,
774	Yourself, renowned prince, then stood as fair
775	As any comer I have look'd on yet
776	For my affection.
777	
778	MOROCCO	                  Even for that I thank you:
779	Therefore, I pray you, lead me to the caskets
780	To try my fortune. By this scimitar
781	That slew the Sophy and a Persian prince
782	That won three fields of Sultan Solyman,
783	I would outstare the sternest eyes that look,
784	Outbrave the heart most daring on the earth,
785	Pluck the young sucking cubs from the she-bear,
786	Yea, mock the lion when he roars for prey,
787	To win thee, lady. But, alas the while!
788	If Hercules and Lichas play at dice
789	Which is the better man, the greater throw
790	May turn by fortune from the weaker hand:
791	So is Alcides beaten by his page;
792	And so may I, blind fortune leading me,
793	Miss that which one unworthier may attain,
794	And die with grieving.
795	
796	PORTIA	You must take your chance,
797	And either not attempt to choose at all
798	Or swear before you choose, if you choose wrong
799	Never to speak to lady afterward
800	In way of marriage: therefore be advised.
801	
802	MOROCCO	Nor will not. Come, bring me unto my chance.
803	
804	PORTIA	First, forward to the temple: after dinner
805	Your hazard shall be made.
806	
807	MOROCCO	Good fortune then!
808	To make me blest or cursed'st among men.
809	
810	[Cornets, and exeunt]

814	
815	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
816	
817	
818	ACT II
819	
820	
821	
822	SCENE II	Venice. A street.
823	
824	
825	[Enter LAUNCELOT]
826	
827	LAUNCELOT	Certainly my conscience will serve me to run from
828	this Jew my master. The fiend is at mine elbow and
829	tempts me saying to me 'Gobbo, Launcelot Gobbo, good
830	Launcelot,' or 'good Gobbo,' or good Launcelot
831	Gobbo, use your legs, take the start, run away. My
832	conscience says 'No; take heed,' honest Launcelot;
833	take heed, honest Gobbo, or, as aforesaid, 'honest
834	Launcelot Gobbo; do not run; scorn running with thy
835	heels.' Well, the most courageous fiend bids me
836	pack: 'Via!' says the fiend; 'away!' says the
837	fiend; 'for the heavens, rouse up a brave mind,'
838	says the fiend, 'and run.' Well, my conscience,
839	hanging about the neck of my heart, says very wisely
840	to me 'My honest friend Launcelot, being an honest
841	man's son,' or rather an honest woman's son; for,
842	indeed, my father did something smack, something
843	grow to, he had a kind of taste; well, my conscience
844	says 'Launcelot, budge not.' 'Budge,' says the
845	fiend. 'Budge not,' says my conscience.
846	'Conscience,' say I, 'you counsel well;' ' Fiend,'
847	say I, 'you counsel well:' to be ruled by my
848	conscience, I should stay with the Jew my master,
849	who, God bless the mark, is a kind of devil; and, to
850	run away from the Jew, I should be ruled by the
851	fiend, who, saving your reverence, is the devil
852	himself. Certainly the Jew is the very devil
853	incarnal; and, in my conscience, my conscience is
854	but a kind of hard conscience, to offer to counsel
855	me to stay with the Jew. The fiend gives the more
856	friendly counsel: I will run, fiend; my heels are
857	at your command; I will run.
858	
859	[Enter Old GOBBO, with a basket]
860	
861	GOBBO	Master young man, you, I pray you, which is the way
862	to master Jew's?
863	
864	LAUNCELOT	[Aside]  O heavens, this is my true-begotten father!
865	who, being more than sand-blind, high-gravel blind,
866	knows me not: I will try confusions with him.
867	
868	GOBBO	Master young gentleman, I pray you, which is the way
869	to master Jew's?
870	
871	LAUNCELOT	Turn up on your right hand at the next turning, but,
872	at the next turning of all, on your left; marry, at
873	the very next turning, turn of no hand, but turn
874	down indirectly to the Jew's house.
875	
876	GOBBO	By God's sonties, 'twill be a hard way to hit. Can
877	you tell me whether one Launcelot,
878	that dwells with him, dwell with him or no?
879	
880	LAUNCELOT	Talk you of young Master Launcelot?
881	
882	[Aside]
883	
884	Mark me now; now will I raise the waters. Talk you
885	of young Master Launcelot?
886	
887	GOBBO	No master, sir, but a poor man's son: his father,
888	though I say it, is an honest exceeding poor man
889	and, God be thanked, well to live.
890	
891	LAUNCELOT	Well, let his father be what a' will, we talk of
892	young Master Launcelot.
893	
894	GOBBO	Your worship's friend and Launcelot, sir.
895	
896	LAUNCELOT	But I pray you, ergo, old man, ergo, I beseech you,
897	talk you of young Master Launcelot?
898	
899	GOBBO	Of Launcelot, an't please your mastership.
900	
901	LAUNCELOT	Ergo, Master Launcelot. Talk not of Master
902	Launcelot, father; for the young gentleman,
903	according to Fates and Destinies and such odd
904	sayings, the Sisters Three and such branches of
905	learning, is indeed deceased, or, as you would say
906	in plain terms, gone to heaven.
907	
908	GOBBO	Marry, God forbid! the boy was the very staff of my
909	age, my very prop.
910	
911	LAUNCELOT	Do I look like a cudgel or a hovel-post, a staff or
912	a prop? Do you know me, father?
913	
914	GOBBO	Alack the day, I know you not, young gentleman:
915	but, I pray you, tell me, is my boy, God rest his
916	soul, alive or dead?
917	
918	LAUNCELOT	Do you not know me, father?
919	
920	GOBBO	Alack, sir, I am sand-blind; I know you not.
921	
922	LAUNCELOT	Nay, indeed, if you had your eyes, you might fail of
923	the knowing me: it is a wise father that knows his
924	own child. Well, old man, I will tell you news of
925	your son: give me your blessing: truth will come
926	to light; murder cannot be hid long; a man's son
927	may, but at the length truth will out.
928	
929	GOBBO	Pray you, sir, stand up: I am sure you are not
930	Launcelot, my boy.
931	
932	LAUNCELOT	Pray you, let's have no more fooling about it, but
933	give me your blessing: I am Launcelot, your boy
934	that was, your son that is, your child that shall
935	be.
936	
937	GOBBO	I cannot think you are my son.
938	
939	LAUNCELOT	I know not what I shall think of that: but I am
940	Launcelot, the Jew's man, and I am sure Margery your
941	wife is my mother.
942	
943	GOBBO	Her name is Margery, indeed: I'll be sworn, if thou
944	be Launcelot, thou art mine own flesh and blood.
945	Lord worshipped might he be! what a beard hast thou
946	got! thou hast got more hair on thy chin than
947	Dobbin my fill-horse has on his tail.
948	
949	LAUNCELOT	It should seem, then, that Dobbin's tail grows
950	backward: I am sure he had more hair of his tail
951	than I have of my face when I last saw him.
952	
953	GOBBO	Lord, how art thou changed! How dost thou and thy
954	master agree? I have brought him a present. How
955	'gree you now?
956	
957	LAUNCELOT	Well, well: but, for mine own part, as I have set
958	up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I
959	have run some ground. My master's a very Jew: give
960	him a present! give him a halter: I am famished in
961	his service; you may tell every finger I have with
962	my ribs. Father, I am glad you are come: give me
963	your present to one Master Bassanio, who, indeed,
964	gives rare new liveries: if I serve not him, I
965	will run as far as God has any ground. O rare
966	fortune! here comes the man: to him, father; for I
967	am a Jew, if I serve the Jew any longer.
968	
969	[Enter BASSANIO, with LEONARDO and other followers]
970	
971	BASSANIO	You may do so; but let it be so hasted that supper
972	be ready at the farthest by five of the clock. See
973	these letters delivered; put the liveries to making,
974	and desire Gratiano to come anon to my lodging.
975	
976	[Exit a Servant]
977	
978	LAUNCELOT	To him, father.
979	
980	GOBBO	God bless your worship!
981	
982	BASSANIO	Gramercy! wouldst thou aught with me?
983	
984	GOBBO	Here's my son, sir, a poor boy,--
985	
986	LAUNCELOT	Not a poor boy, sir, but the rich Jew's man; that
987	would, sir, as my father shall specify--
988	
989	GOBBO	He hath a great infection, sir, as one would say, to serve--
990	
991	LAUNCELOT	Indeed, the short and the long is, I serve the Jew,
992	and have a desire, as my father shall specify--
993	
994	GOBBO	His master and he, saving your worship's reverence,
995	are scarce cater-cousins--
996	
997	LAUNCELOT	To be brief, the very truth is that the Jew, having
998	done me wrong, doth cause me, as my father, being, I
999	hope, an old man, shall frutify unto you--
1000	
1001	GOBBO	I have here a dish of doves that I would bestow upon
1002	your worship, and my suit is--
1003	
1004	LAUNCELOT	In very brief, the suit is impertinent to myself, as
1005	your worship shall know by this honest old man; and,
1006	though I say it, though old man, yet poor man, my father.
1007	
1008	BASSANIO	One speak for both. What would you?
1009	
1010	LAUNCELOT	Serve you, sir.
1011	
1012	GOBBO	That is the very defect of the matter, sir.
1013	
1014	BASSANIO	I know thee well; thou hast obtain'd thy suit:
1015	Shylock thy master spoke with me this day,
1016	And hath preferr'd thee, if it be preferment
1017	To leave a rich Jew's service, to become
1018	The follower of so poor a gentleman.
1019	
1020	LAUNCELOT	The old proverb is very well parted between my
1021	master Shylock and you, sir: you have the grace of
1022	God, sir, and he hath enough.
1023	
1024	BASSANIO	Thou speak'st it well. Go, father, with thy son.
1025	Take leave of thy old master and inquire
1026	My lodging out. Give him a livery
1027	More guarded than his fellows': see it done.
1028	
1029	LAUNCELOT	Father, in. I cannot get a service, no; I have
1030	ne'er a tongue in my head. Well, if any man in
1031	Italy have a fairer table which doth offer to swear
1032	upon a book, I shall have good fortune. Go to,
1033	here's a simple line of life: here's a small trifle
1034	of wives: alas, fifteen wives is nothing! eleven
1035	widows and nine maids is a simple coming-in for one
1036	man: and then to 'scape drowning thrice, and to be
1037	in peril of my life with the edge of a feather-bed;
1038	here are simple scapes. Well, if Fortune be a
1039	woman, she's a good wench for this gear. Father,
1040	come; I'll take my leave of the Jew in the twinkling of an eye.
1041	
1042	[Exeunt Launcelot and Old Gobbo]
1043	
1044	BASSANIO	I pray thee, good Leonardo, think on this:
1045	These things being bought and orderly bestow'd,
1046	Return in haste, for I do feast to-night
1047	My best-esteem'd acquaintance: hie thee, go.
1048	
1049	LEONARDO	My best endeavours shall be done herein.
1050	
1051	[Enter GRATIANO]
1052	
1053	GRATIANO	Where is your master?
1054	
1055	LEONARDO	Yonder, sir, he walks.
1056	
1057	[Exit]
1058	
1059	GRATIANO	Signior Bassanio!
1060	
1061	BASSANIO	Gratiano!
1062	
1063	GRATIANO	I have a suit to you.
1064	
1065	BASSANIO	You have obtain'd it.
1066	
1067	GRATIANO	You must not deny me: I must go with you to Belmont.
1068	
1069	BASSANIO	Why then you must. But hear thee, Gratiano;
1070	Thou art too wild, too rude and bold of voice;
1071	Parts that become thee happily enough
1072	And in such eyes as ours appear not faults;
1073	But where thou art not known, why, there they show
1074	Something too liberal. Pray thee, take pain
1075	To allay with some cold drops of modesty
1076	Thy skipping spirit, lest through thy wild behavior
1077	I be misconstrued in the place I go to,
1078	And lose my hopes.
1079	
1080	GRATIANO	                  Signior Bassanio, hear me:
1081	If I do not put on a sober habit,
1082	Talk with respect and swear but now and then,
1083	Wear prayer-books in my pocket, look demurely,
1084	Nay more, while grace is saying, hood mine eyes
1085	Thus with my hat, and sigh and say 'amen,'
1086	Use all the observance of civility,
1087	Like one well studied in a sad ostent
1088	To please his grandam, never trust me more.
1089	
1090	BASSANIO	Well, we shall see your bearing.
1091	
1092	GRATIANO	Nay, but I bar to-night: you shall not gauge me
1093	By what we do to-night.
1094	
1095	BASSANIO	No, that were pity:
1096	I would entreat you rather to put on
1097	Your boldest suit of mirth, for we have friends
1098	That purpose merriment. But fare you well:
1099	I have some business.
1100	
1101	GRATIANO	And I must to Lorenzo and the rest:
1102	But we will visit you at supper-time.

1119	[Enter JESSICA and LAUNCELOT]
1120	
1121	JESSICA	I am sorry thou wilt leave my father so:
1122	Our house is hell, and thou, a merry devil,
1123	Didst rob it of some taste of tediousness.
1124	But fare thee well, there is a ducat for thee:
1125	And, Launcelot, soon at supper shalt thou see
1126	Lorenzo, who is thy new master's guest:
1127	Give him this letter; do it secretly;
1128	And so farewell: I would not have my father
1129	See me in talk with thee.
1130	
1131	LAUNCELOT	Adieu! tears exhibit my tongue. Most beautiful
1132	pagan, most sweet Jew! if a Christian did not play
1133	the knave and get thee, I am much deceived. But,
1134	adieu: these foolish drops do something drown my
1135	manly spirit: adieu.
1136	
1137	JESSICA	Farewell, good Launcelot.
1138	
1139	[Exit Launcelot]
1140	
1141	Alack, what heinous sin is it in me
1142	To be ashamed to be my father's child!
1143	But though I am a daughter to his blood,
1144	I am not to his manners. O Lorenzo,
1145	If thou keep promise, I shall end this strife,
1146	Become a Christian and thy loving wife.

1164	
1165	LORENZO	Nay, we will slink away in supper-time,
1166	Disguise us at my lodging and return,
1167	All in an hour.
1168	
1169	GRATIANO	We have not made good preparation.
1170	
1171	SALARINO	We have not spoke us yet of torchbearers.
1172	
1173	SALANIO	'Tis vile, unless it may be quaintly order'd,
1174	And better in my mind not undertook.
1175	
1176	LORENZO	'Tis now but four o'clock: we have two hours
1177	To furnish us.
1178	
1179	[Enter LAUNCELOT, with a letter]
1180	
1181	Friend Launcelot, what's the news?
1182	
1183	LAUNCELOT	An it shall please you to break up
1184	this, it shall seem to signify.
1185	
1186	LORENZO	I know the hand: in faith, 'tis a fair hand;
1187	And whiter than the paper it writ on
1188	Is the fair hand that writ.
1189	
1190	GRATIANO	Love-news, in faith.
1191	
1192	LAUNCELOT	By your leave, sir.
1193	
1194	LORENZO	Whither goest thou?
1195	
1196	LAUNCELOT	Marry, sir, to bid my old master the
1197	Jew to sup to-night with my new master the Christian.
1198	
1199	LORENZO	Hold here, take this: tell gentle Jessica
1200	I will not fail her; speak it privately.
1201	Go, gentlemen,
1202	
1203	[Exit Launcelot]
1204	
1205	Will you prepare you for this masque tonight?
1206	I am provided of a torch-bearer.
1207	
1208	SALANIO	Ay, marry, I'll be gone about it straight.
1209	
1210	SALANIO	And so will I.
1211	
1212	LORENZO	                  Meet me and Gratiano
1213	At Gratiano's lodging some hour hence.
1214

1216	
1217	[Exeunt SALARINO and SALANIO]
1218	
1219	GRATIANO	Was not that letter from fair Jessica?
1220	
1221	LORENZO	I must needs tell thee all. She hath directed
1222	How I shall take her from her father's house,
1223	What gold and jewels she is furnish'd with,
1224	What page's suit she hath in readiness.
1225	If e'er the Jew her father come to heaven,
1226	It will be for his gentle daughter's sake:
1227	And never dare misfortune cross her foot,
1228	Unless she do it under this excuse,
1229	That she is issue to a faithless Jew.
1230	Come, go with me; peruse this as thou goest:
1231	Fair Jessica shall be my torch-bearer.

1249	
1250	SHYLOCK	Well, thou shalt see, thy eyes shall be thy judge,
1251	The difference of old Shylock and Bassanio:--
1252	What, Jessica!--thou shalt not gormandise,
1253	As thou hast done with me:--What, Jessica!--
1254	And sleep and snore, and rend apparel out;--
1255	Why, Jessica, I say!
1256	
1257	LAUNCELOT	Why, Jessica!
1258	
1259	SHYLOCK	Who bids thee call? I do not bid thee call.
1260	
1261	LAUNCELOT	Your worship was wont to tell me that
1262	I could do nothing without bidding.
1263	
1264	[Enter Jessica]
1265	
1266	JESSICA	Call you? what is your will?
1267	
1268	SHYLOCK	I am bid forth to supper, Jessica:
1269	There are my keys. But wherefore should I go?
1270	I am not bid for love; they flatter me:
1271	But yet I'll go in hate, to feed upon
1272	The prodigal Christian. Jessica, my girl,
1273	Look to my house. I am right loath to go:
1274	There is some ill a-brewing towards my rest,
1275	For I did dream of money-bags to-night.
1276	
1277	LAUNCELOT	I beseech you, sir, go: my young master doth expect
1278	your reproach.
1279	
1280	SHYLOCK	So do I his.
1281	
1282	LAUNCELOT	An they have conspired together, I will not say you
1283	shall see a masque; but if you do, then it was not
1284	for nothing that my nose fell a-bleeding on
1285	Black-Monday last at six o'clock i' the morning,
1286	falling out that year on Ash-Wednesday was four
1287	year, in the afternoon.
1288	
1289	SHYLOCK	What, are there masques? Hear you me, Jessica:
1290	Lock up my doors; and when you hear the drum
1291	And the vile squealing of the wry-neck'd fife,
1292	Clamber not you up to the casements then,
1293	Nor thrust your head into the public street
1294	To gaze on Christian fools with varnish'd faces,
1295	But stop my house's ears, I mean my casements:
1296	Let not the sound of shallow foppery enter
1297	My sober house. By Jacob's staff, I swear,
1298	I have no mind of feasting forth to-night:
1299	But I will go. Go you before me, sirrah;
1300	Say I will come.
1301	
1302	LAUNCELOT	I will go before, sir. Mistress, look out at
1303	window, for all this, There will come a Christian
1304	boy, will be worth a Jewess' eye.
1305	
1306	[Exit]
1307	
1308	SHYLOCK	What says that fool of Hagar's offspring, ha?
1309	
1310	
1311	JESSICA	His words were 'Farewell mistress;' nothing else.
1312	
1313	SHYLOCK	The patch is kind enough, but a huge feeder;
1314	Snail-slow in profit, and he sleeps by day
1315	More than the wild-cat: drones hive not with me;
1316	Therefore I part with him, and part with him
1317	To one that would have him help to waste
1318	His borrow'd purse. Well, Jessica, go in;
1319	Perhaps I will return immediately:
1320	Do as I bid you; shut doors after you:
1321	Fast bind, fast find;
1322	A proverb never stale in thrifty mind.
1323	
1324	[Exit]
1325	
1326	JESSICA	Farewell; and if my fortune be not crost,
1327	I have a father, you a daughter, lost.

1346	GRATIANO	This is the pent-house under which Lorenzo
1347	Desired us to make stand.
1348	
1349	SALARINO	His hour is almost past.
1350	
1351	GRATIANO	And it is marvel he out-dwells his hour,
1352	For lovers ever run before the clock.
1353	
1354	SALARINO	O, ten times faster Venus' pigeons fly
1355	To seal love's bonds new-made, than they are wont
1356	To keep obliged faith unforfeited!
1357	
1358	GRATIANO	That ever holds: who riseth from a feast
1359	With that keen appetite that he sits down?
1360	Where is the horse that doth untread again
1361	His tedious measures with the unbated fire
1362	That he did pace them first? All things that are,
1363	Are with more spirit chased than enjoy'd.
1364	How like a younker or a prodigal
1365	The scarfed bark puts from her native bay,
1366	Hugg'd and embraced by the strumpet wind!
1367	How like the prodigal doth she return,
1368	With over-weather'd ribs and ragged sails,
1369	Lean, rent and beggar'd by the strumpet wind!
1370	
1371	SALARINO	Here comes Lorenzo: more of this hereafter.
1372	
1373	[Enter LORENZO]
1374	
1375	LORENZO	Sweet friends, your patience for my long abode;
1376	Not I, but my affairs, have made you wait:
1377	When you shall please to play the thieves for wives,
1378	I'll watch as long for you then. Approach;
1379	Here dwells my father Jew. Ho! who's within?
1380	
1381	[Enter JESSICA, above, in boy's clothes]
1382	
1383	JESSICA	Who are you? Tell me, for more certainty,
1384	Albeit I'll swear that I do know your tongue.
1385	
1386	LORENZO	Lorenzo, and thy love.
1387	
1388	JESSICA	Lorenzo, certain, and my love indeed,
1389	For who love I so much? And now who knows
1390	But you, Lorenzo, whether I am yours?
1391	
1392	LORENZO	Heaven and thy thoughts are witness that thou art.
1393	
1394	JESSICA	Here, catch this casket; it is worth the pains.
1395	I am glad 'tis night, you do not look on me,
1396	For I am much ashamed of my exchange:
1397	But love is blind and lovers cannot see
1398	The pretty follies that themselves commit;
1399	For if they could, Cupid himself would blush
1400	To see me thus transformed to a boy.
1401	
1402	LORENZO	Descend, for you must be my torchbearer.
1403	
1404	JESSICA	What, must I hold a candle to my shames?
1405	They in themselves, good-sooth, are too too light.
1406	Why, 'tis an office of discovery, love;
1407	And I should be obscured.
1408	
1409	LORENZO	So are you, sweet,
1410	Even in the lovely garnish of a boy.
1411	But come at once;
1412	For the close night doth play the runaway,
1413	And we are stay'd for at Bassanio's feast.
1414	
1415	JESSICA	I will make fast the doors, and gild myself
1416	With some more ducats, and be with you straight.
1417

1420	GRATIANO	Now, by my hood, a Gentile and no Jew.
1421	
1422	LORENZO	Beshrew me but I love her heartily;
1423	For she is wise, if I can judge of her,
1424	And fair she is, if that mine eyes be true,
1425	And true she is, as she hath proved herself,
1426	And therefore, like herself, wise, fair and true,
1427	Shall she be placed in my constant soul.

1443	'Tis nine o'clock: our friends all stay for you.
1444	No masque to-night: the wind is come about;
1445	Bassanio presently will go aboard:
1446	I have sent twenty out to seek for you.
1447

1449	Than to be under sail and gone to-night.

1464	
1465	
1466	[Flourish of cornets. Enter PORTIA, with the
1467	PRINCE OF MOROCCO, and their trains]
1468	
1469	PORTIA	Go draw aside the curtains and discover
1470	The several caskets to this noble prince.
1471	Now make your choice.
1472	
1473	MOROCCO	The first, of gold, who this inscription bears,
1474	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire;'
1475	The second, silver, which this promise carries,
1476	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves;'
1477	This third, dull lead, with warning all as blunt,
1478	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
1479	How shall I know if I do choose the right?
1480	
1481	PORTIA	The one of them contains my picture, prince:
1482	If you choose that, then I am yours withal.
1483	
1484	MOROCCO	Some god direct my judgment! Let me see;
1485	I will survey the inscriptions back again.
1486	What says this leaden casket?
1487	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
1488	Must give: for what? for lead? hazard for lead?
1489	This casket threatens. Men that hazard all
1490	Do it in hope of fair advantages:
1491	A golden mind stoops not to shows of dross;
1492	I'll then nor give nor hazard aught for lead.
1493	What says the silver with her virgin hue?
1494	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
1495	As much as he deserves! Pause there, Morocco,
1496	And weigh thy value with an even hand:
1497	If thou be'st rated by thy estimation,
1498	Thou dost deserve enough; and yet enough
1499	May not extend so far as to the lady:
1500	And yet to be afeard of my deserving
1501	Were but a weak disabling of myself.
1502	As much as I deserve! Why, that's the lady:
1503	I do in birth deserve her, and in fortunes,
1504	In graces and in qualities of breeding;
1505	But more than these, in love I do deserve.
1506	What if I stray'd no further, but chose here?
1507	Let's see once more this saying graved in gold
1508	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
1509	Why, that's the lady; all the world desires her;
1510	From the four corners of the earth they come,
1511	To kiss this shrine, this mortal-breathing saint:
1512	The Hyrcanian deserts and the vasty wilds
1513	Of wide Arabia are as thoroughfares now
1514	For princes to come view fair Portia:
1515	The watery kingdom, whose ambitious head
1516	Spits in the face of heaven, is no bar
1517	To stop the foreign spirits, but they come,
1518	As o'er a brook, to see fair Portia.
1519	One of these three contains her heavenly picture.
1520	Is't like that lead contains her? 'Twere damnation
1521	To think so base a thought: it were too gross
1522	To rib her cerecloth in the obscure grave.
1523	Or shall I think in silver she's immured,
1524	Being ten times undervalued to tried gold?
1525	O sinful thought! Never so rich a gem
1526	Was set in worse than gold. They have in England
1527	A coin that bears the figure of an angel
1528	Stamped in gold, but that's insculp'd upon;
1529	But here an angel in a golden bed
1530	Lies all within. Deliver me the key:
1531	Here do I choose, and thrive I as I may!
1532	
1533	PORTIA	There, take it, prince; and if my form lie there,
1534	Then I am yours.
1535	
1536	[He unlocks the golden casket]
1537	
1538	MOROCCO	                  O hell! what have we here?
1539	A carrion Death, within whose empty eye
1540	There is a written scroll! I'll read the writing.
1541	
1542	[Reads]
1543	
1544	All that glitters is not gold;
1545	Often have you heard that told:
1546	Many a man his life hath sold
1547	But my outside to behold:
1548	Gilded tombs do worms enfold.
1549	Had you been as wise as bold,
1550	Young in limbs, in judgment old,
1551	Your answer had not been inscroll'd:
1552	Fare you well; your suit is cold.
1553	Cold, indeed; and labour lost:
1554	Then, farewell, heat, and welcome, frost!
1555	Portia, adieu. I have too grieved a heart
1556	To take a tedious leave: thus losers part.
1557	
1558	[Exit with his train. Flourish of cornets]

1579	
1580	SALARINO	Why, man, I saw Bassanio under sail:
1581	With him is Gratiano gone along;
1582	And in their ship I am sure Lorenzo is not.
1583	
1584	SALANIO	The villain Jew with outcries raised the duke,
1585	Who went with him to search Bassanio's ship.
1586	
1587	SALARINO	He came too late, the ship was under sail:
1588	But there the duke was given to understand
1589	That in a gondola were seen together
1590	Lorenzo and his amorous Jessica:
1591	Besides, Antonio certified the duke
1592	They were not with Bassanio in his ship.
1593	
1594	SALANIO	I never heard a passion so confused,
1595	So strange, outrageous, and so variable,
1596	As the dog Jew did utter in the streets:
1597	'My daughter! O my ducats! O my daughter!
1598	Fled with a Christian! O my Christian ducats!
1599	Justice! the law! my ducats, and my daughter!
1600	A sealed bag, two sealed bags of ducats,
1601	Of double ducats, stolen from me by my daughter!
1602	And jewels, two stones, two rich and precious stones,
1603	Stolen by my daughter! Justice! find the girl;
1604	She hath the stones upon her, and the ducats.'
1605	
1606	SALARINO	Why, all the boys in Venice follow him,
1607	Crying, his stones, his daughter, and his ducats.
1608	
1609	SALANIO	Let good Antonio look he keep his day,
1610	Or he shall pay for this.
1611	
1612	SALARINO	Marry, well remember'd.
1613	I reason'd with a Frenchman yesterday,
1614	Who told me, in the narrow seas that part
1615	The French and English, there miscarried
1616	A vessel of our country richly fraught:
1617	I thought upon Antonio when he told me;
1618	And wish'd in silence that it were not his.
1619	
1620	SALANIO	You were best to tell Antonio what you hear;
1621	Yet do not suddenly, for it may grieve him.
1622	
1623	SALARINO	A kinder gentleman treads not the earth.
1624	I saw Bassanio and Antonio part:
1625	Bassanio told him he would make some speed
1626	Of his return: he answer'd, 'Do not so;
1627	Slubber not business for my sake, Bassanio
1628	But stay the very riping of the time;
1629	And for the Jew's bond which he hath of me,
1630	Let it not enter in your mind of love:
1631	Be merry, and employ your chiefest thoughts
1632	To courtship and such fair ostents of love
1633	As shall conveniently become you there:'
1634	And even there, his eye being big with tears,
1635	Turning his face, he put his hand behind him,
1636	And with affection wondrous sensible
1637	He wrung Bassanio's hand; and so they parted.
1638	
1639	SALANIO	I think he only loves the world for him.
1640	I pray thee, let us go and find him out
1641	And quicken his embraced heaviness
1642	With some delight or other.
1643	
1644	SALARINO	Do we so.
1645	
1646	[Exeunt]

1651	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
1652	
1653	
1654	ACT II
1655	
1656	
1657	
1658	SCENE IX	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
1659	
1660	
1661	[Enter NERISSA with a Servitor]
1662	
1663	NERISSA	Quick, quick, I pray thee; draw the curtain straight:
1664	The Prince of Arragon hath ta'en his oath,
1665	And comes to his election presently.
1666	
1667	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the PRINCE OF ARRAGON,
1668	PORTIA, and their trains]
1669	
1670	PORTIA	Behold, there stand the caskets, noble prince:
1671	If you choose that wherein I am contain'd,
1672	Straight shall our nuptial rites be solemnized:
1673	But if you fail, without more speech, my lord,
1674	You must be gone from hence immediately.
1675	
1676	ARRAGON	I am enjoin'd by oath to observe three things:
1677	First, never to unfold to any one
1678	Which casket 'twas I chose; next, if I fail
1679	Of the right casket, never in my life
1680	To woo a maid in way of marriage: Lastly,
1681	If I do fail in fortune of my choice,
1682	Immediately to leave you and be gone.
1683	
1684	PORTIA	To these injunctions every one doth swear
1685	That comes to hazard for my worthless self.
1686	
1687	ARRAGON	And so have I address'd me. Fortune now
1688	To my heart's hope! Gold; silver; and base lead.
1689	'Who chooseth me must give and hazard all he hath.'
1690	You shall look fairer, ere I give or hazard.
1691	What says the golden chest? ha! let me see:
1692	'Who chooseth me shall gain what many men desire.'
1693	What many men desire! that 'many' may be meant
1694	By the fool multitude, that choose by show,
1695	Not learning more than the fond eye doth teach;
1696	Which pries not to the interior, but, like the martlet,
1697	Builds in the weather on the outward wall,
1698	Even in the force and road of casualty.
1699	I will not choose what many men desire,
1700	Because I will not jump with common spirits
1701	And rank me with the barbarous multitudes.
1702	Why, then to thee, thou silver treasure-house;
1703	Tell me once more what title thou dost bear:
1704	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves:'
1705	And well said too; for who shall go about
1706	To cozen fortune and be honourable
1707	Without the stamp of merit? Let none presume
1708	To wear an undeserved dignity.
1709	O, that estates, degrees and offices
1710	Were not derived corruptly, and that clear honour
1711	Were purchased by the merit of the wearer!
1712	How many then should cover that stand bare!
1713	How many be commanded that command!
1714	How much low peasantry would then be glean'd
1715	From the true seed of honour! and how much honour
1716	Pick'd from the chaff and ruin of the times
1717	To be new-varnish'd! Well, but to my choice:
1718	'Who chooseth me shall get as much as he deserves.'
1719	I will assume desert. Give me a key for this,
1720	And instantly unlock my fortunes here.
1721	
1722	[He opens the silver casket]
1723	
1724	PORTIA	Too long a pause for that which you find there.
1725	
1726	ARRAGON	What's here? the portrait of a blinking idiot,
1727	Presenting me a schedule! I will read it.
1728	How much unlike art thou to Portia!
1729	How much unlike my hopes and my deservings!
1730	'Who chooseth me shall have as much as he deserves.'
1731	Did I deserve no more than a fool's head?
1732	Is that my prize? are my deserts no better?
1733	
1734	PORTIA	To offend, and judge, are distinct offices
1735	And of opposed natures.
1736	
1737	ARRAGON	What is here?
1738	
1739	[Reads]
1740	
1741	The fire seven times tried this:
1742	Seven times tried that judgment is,
1743	That did never choose amiss.
1744	Some there be that shadows kiss;
1745	Such have but a shadow's bliss:
1746	There be fools alive, I wis,
1747	Silver'd o'er; and so was this.
1748	Take what wife you will to bed,
1749	I will ever be your head:
1750	So be gone: you are sped.
1751	Still more fool I shall appear
1752	By the time I linger here
1753	With one fool's head I came to woo,
1754	But I go away with two.
1755	Sweet, adieu. I'll keep my oath,
1756	Patiently to bear my wroth.
1757	
1758	[Exeunt Arragon and train]
1759	
1760	PORTIA	Thus hath the candle singed the moth.
1761	O, these deliberate fools! when they do choose,
1762	They have the wisdom by their wit to lose.
1763	
1764	NERISSA	The ancient saying is no heresy,
1765	Hanging and wiving goes by destiny.
1766	
1767	PORTIA	Come, draw the curtain, Nerissa.
1768	
1769	[Enter a Servant]
1770	
1771	Servant	Where is my lady?
1772	
1773	PORTIA	                  Here: what would my lord?
1774	
1775	Servant	Madam, there is alighted at your gate
1776	A young Venetian, one that comes before
1777	To signify the approaching of his lord;
1778	From whom he bringeth sensible regreets,
1779	To wit, besides commends and courteous breath,
1780	Gifts of rich value. Yet I have not seen
1781	So likely an ambassador of love:
1782	A day in April never came so sweet,
1783	To show how costly summer was at hand,
1784	As this fore-spurrer comes before his lord.
1785	
1786	PORTIA	No more, I pray thee: I am half afeard
1787	Thou wilt say anon he is some kin to thee,
1788	Thou spend'st such high-day wit in praising him.
1789	Come, come, Nerissa; for I long to see
1790	Quick Cupid's post that comes so mannerly.
1791	
1792	NERISSA	Bassanio, lord Love, if thy will it be!
1793	
1794	[Exeunt]

1799	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
1800	
1801	
1802	ACT III
1803	
1804	
1805	
1806	SCENE I	Venice. A street.
1807	
1808	
1809	[Enter SALANIO and SALARINO]
1810	
1811	SALANIO	Now, what news on the Rialto?
1812	
1813	SALARINO	Why, yet it lives there uncheck'd that Antonio hath
1814	a ship of rich lading wrecked on the narrow seas;
1815	the Goodwins, I think they call the place; a very
1816	dangerous flat and fatal, where the carcasses of many
1817	a tall ship lie buried, as they say, if my gossip
1818	Report be an honest woman of her word.
1819	
1820	SALANIO	I would she were as lying a gossip in that as ever
1821	knapped ginger or made her neighbours believe she
1822	wept for the death of a third husband. But it is
1823	true, without any slips of prolixity or crossing the
1824	plain highway of talk, that the good Antonio, the
1825	honest Antonio,--O that I had a title good enough
1826	to keep his name company!--
1827	
1828	SALARINO	Come, the full stop.
1829	
1830	SALANIO	Ha! what sayest thou? Why, the end is, he hath
1831	lost a ship.
1832	
1833	SALARINO	I would it might prove the end of his losses.
1834	
1835	SALANIO	Let me say 'amen' betimes, lest the devil cross my
1836	prayer, for here he comes in the likeness of a Jew.
1837	
1838	[Enter SHYLOCK]
1839	
1840	How now, Shylock! what news among the merchants?
1841	
1842	SHYLOCK	You know, none so well, none so well as you, of my
1843	daughter's flight.
1844	
1845	SALARINO	That's certain: I, for my part, knew the tailor
1846	that made the wings she flew withal.
1847	
1848	SALANIO	And Shylock, for his own part, knew the bird was
1849	fledged; and then it is the complexion of them all
1850	to leave the dam.
1851	
1852	SHYLOCK	She is damned for it.
1853	
1854	SALANIO	That's certain, if the devil may be her judge.
1855	
1856	SHYLOCK	My own flesh and blood to rebel!
1857	
1858	SALANIO	Out upon it, old carrion! rebels it at these years?
1859	
1860	SHYLOCK	I say, my daughter is my flesh and blood.
1861	
1862	SALARINO	There is more difference between thy flesh and hers
1863	than between jet and ivory; more between your bloods
1864	than there is between red wine and rhenish. But
1865	tell us, do you hear whether Antonio have had any
1866	loss at sea or no?
1867	
1868	SHYLOCK	There I have another bad match: a bankrupt, a
1869	prodigal, who dare scarce show his head on the
1870	Rialto; a beggar, that was used to come so smug upon
1871	the mart; let him look to his bond: he was wont to
1872	call me usurer; let him look to his bond: he was
1873	wont to lend money for a Christian courtesy; let him
1874	look to his bond.
1875	
1876	SALARINO	Why, I am sure, if he forfeit, thou wilt not take
1877	his flesh: what's that good for?
1878	
1879	SHYLOCK	To bait fish withal: if it will feed nothing else,
1880	it will feed my revenge. He hath disgraced me, and
1881	hindered me half a million; laughed at my losses,
1882	mocked at my gains, scorned my nation, thwarted my
1883	bargains, cooled my friends, heated mine
1884	enemies; and what's his reason? I am a Jew. Hath
1885	not a Jew eyes? hath not a Jew hands, organs,
1886	dimensions, senses, affections, passions? fed with
1887	the same food, hurt with the same weapons, subject
1888	to the same diseases, healed by the same means,
1889	warmed and cooled by the same winter and summer, as
1890	a Christian is? If you prick us, do we not bleed?
1891	if you tickle us, do we not laugh? if you poison
1892	us, do we not die? and if you wrong us, shall we not
1893	revenge? If we are like you in the rest, we will
1894	resemble you in that. If a Jew wrong a Christian,
1895	what is his humility? Revenge. If a Christian
1896	wrong a Jew, what should his sufferance be by
1897	Christian example? Why, revenge. The villany you
1898	teach me, I will execute, and it shall go hard but I
1899	will better the instruction.
1900	
1901	[Enter a Servant]
1902	
1903	Servant	Gentlemen, my master Antonio is at his house and
1904	desires to speak with you both.
1905	
1906	SALARINO	We have been up and down to seek him.
1907	
1908	[Enter TUBAL]
1909	
1910	SALANIO	Here comes another of the tribe: a third cannot be
1911	matched, unless the devil himself turn Jew.
1912	
1913	[Exeunt SALANIO, SALARINO, and Servant]
1914	
1915	SHYLOCK	How now, Tubal! what news from Genoa? hast thou
1916	found my daughter?
1917	
1918	TUBAL	I often came where I did hear of her, but cannot find her.
1919	
1920	SHYLOCK	Why, there, there, there, there! a diamond gone,
1921	cost me two thousand ducats in Frankfort! The curse
1922	never fell upon our nation till now; I never felt it
1923	till now: two thousand ducats in that; and other
1924	precious, precious jewels. I would my daughter
1925	were dead at my foot, and the jewels in her ear!
1926	would she were hearsed at my foot, and the ducats in
1927	her coffin! No news of them? Why, so: and I know
1928	not what's spent in the search: why, thou loss upon
1929	loss! the thief gone with so much, and so much to
1930	find the thief; and no satisfaction, no revenge:
1931	nor no in luck stirring but what lights on my
1932	shoulders; no sighs but of my breathing; no tears
1933	but of my shedding.
1934	
1935	TUBAL	Yes, other men have ill luck too: Antonio, as I
1936	heard in Genoa,--
1937	
1938	SHYLOCK	What, what, what? ill luck, ill luck?
1939	
1940	TUBAL	Hath an argosy cast away, coming from Tripolis.
1941	
1942	SHYLOCK	I thank God, I thank God. Is't true, is't true?
1943	
1944	TUBAL	I spoke with some of the sailors that escaped the wreck.
1945	
1946	SHYLOCK	I thank thee, good Tubal: good news, good news!
1947	ha, ha! where? in Genoa?
1948	
1949	TUBAL	Your daughter spent in Genoa, as I heard, in one
1950	night fourscore ducats.
1951	
1952	SHYLOCK	Thou stickest a dagger in me: I shall never see my
1953	gold again: fourscore ducats at a sitting!
1954	fourscore ducats!
1955	
1956	TUBAL	There came divers of Antonio's creditors in my
1957	company to Venice, that swear he cannot choose but break.
1958	
1959	SHYLOCK	I am very glad of it: I'll plague him; I'll torture
1960	him: I am glad of it.
1961	
1962	TUBAL	One of them showed me a ring that he had of your
1963	daughter for a monkey.
1964	
1965	SHYLOCK	Out upon her! Thou torturest me, Tubal: it was my
1966	turquoise; I had it of Leah when I was a bachelor:
1967	I would not have given it for a wilderness of monkeys.
1968	
1969	TUBAL	But Antonio is certainly undone.
1970	
1971	SHYLOCK	Nay, that's true, that's very true. Go, Tubal, fee
1972	me an officer; bespeak him a fortnight before. I
1973	will have the heart of him, if he forfeit; for, were
1974	he out of Venice, I can make what merchandise I
1975	will. Go, go, Tubal, and meet me at our synagogue;
1976	go, good Tubal; at our synagogue, Tubal.

1984	
1985	
1986	ACT III
1987	
1988	
1989	
1990	SCENE II	Belmont. A room in PORTIA'S house.
1991	
1992	
1993	[Enter BASSANIO, PORTIA, GRATIANO, NERISSA, and
1994	Attendants]
1995	
1996	PORTIA	I pray you, tarry: pause a day or two
1997	Before you hazard; for, in choosing wrong,
1998	I lose your company: therefore forbear awhile.
1999	There's something tells me, but it is not love,
2000	I would not lose you; and you know yourself,
2001	Hate counsels not in such a quality.
2002	But lest you should not understand me well,--
2003	And yet a maiden hath no tongue but thought,--
2004	I would detain you here some month or two
2005	Before you venture for me. I could teach you
2006	How to choose right, but I am then forsworn;
2007	So will I never be: so may you miss me;
2008	But if you do, you'll make me wish a sin,
2009	That I had been forsworn. Beshrew your eyes,
2010	They have o'erlook'd me and divided me;
2011	One half of me is yours, the other half yours,
2012	Mine own, I would say; but if mine, then yours,
2013	And so all yours. O, these naughty times
2014	Put bars between the owners and their rights!
2015	And so, though yours, not yours. Prove it so,
2016	Let fortune go to hell for it, not I.
2017	I speak too long; but 'tis to peize the time,
2018	To eke it and to draw it out in length,
2019	To stay you from election.
2020	
2021	BASSANIO	Let me choose
2022	For as I am, I live upon the rack.
2023	
2024	PORTIA	Upon the rack, Bassanio! then confess
2025	What treason there is mingled with your love.
2026	
2027	BASSANIO	None but that ugly treason of mistrust,
2028	Which makes me fear the enjoying of my love:
2029	There may as well be amity and life
2030	'Tween snow and fire, as treason and my love.
2031	
2032	PORTIA	Ay, but I fear you speak upon the rack,
2033	Where men enforced do speak anything.
2034	
2035	BASSANIO	Promise me life, and I'll confess the truth.
2036	
2037	PORTIA	Well then, confess and live.
2038	
2039	BASSANIO	'Confess' and 'love'
2040	Had been the very sum of my confession:
2041	O happy torment, when my torturer
2042	Doth teach me answers for deliverance!
2043	But let me to my fortune and the caskets.
2044	
2045	PORTIA	Away, then! I am lock'd in one of them:
2046	If you do love me, you will find me out.
2047	Nerissa and the rest, stand all aloof.
2048	Let music sound while he doth make his choice;
2049	Then, if he lose, he makes a swan-like end,
2050	Fading in music: that the comparison
2051	May stand more proper, my eye shall be the stream
2052	And watery death-bed for him. He may win;
2053	And what is music then? Then music is
2054	Even as the flourish when true subjects bow
2055	To a new-crowned monarch: such it is
2056	As are those dulcet sounds in break of day
2057	That creep into the dreaming bridegroom's ear,
2058	And summon him to marriage. Now he goes,
2059	With no less presence, but with much more love,
2060	Than young Alcides, when he did redeem
2061	The virgin tribute paid by howling Troy
2062	To the sea-monster: I stand for sacrifice
2063	The rest aloof are the Dardanian wives,
2064	With bleared visages, come forth to view
2065	The issue of the exploit. Go, Hercules!
2066	Live thou, I live: with much, much more dismay
2067	I view the fight than thou that makest the fray.
2068	
2069	[Music, whilst BASSANIO comments on the caskets to himself]
2070	
2071	SONG.
2072	Tell me where is fancy bred,
2073	Or in the heart, or in the head?
2074	How begot, how nourished?
2075	Reply, reply.
2076	It is engender'd in the eyes,
2077	With gazing fed; and fancy dies
2078	In the cradle where it lies.
2079	Let us all ring fancy's knell
2080	I'll begin it,--Ding, dong, bell.
2081	
2082	ALL	Ding, dong, bell.
2083	
2084	BASSANIO	So may the outward shows be least themselves:
2085	The world is still deceived with ornament.
2086	In law, what plea so tainted and corrupt,
2087	But, being seasoned with a gracious voice,
2088	Obscures the show of evil? In religion,
2089	What damned error, but some sober brow
2090	Will bless it and approve it with a text,
2091	Hiding the grossness with fair ornament?
2092	There is no vice so simple but assumes
2093	Some mark of virtue on his outward parts:
2094	How many cowards, whose hearts are all as false
2095	As stairs of sand, wear yet upon their chins
2096	The beards of Hercules and frowning Mars;
2097	Who, inward search'd, have livers white as milk;
2098	And these assume but valour's excrement
2099	To render them redoubted! Look on beauty,
2100	And you shall see 'tis purchased by the weight;
2101	Which therein works a miracle in nature,
2102	Making them lightest that wear most of it:
2103	So are those crisped snaky golden locks
2104	Which make such wanton gambols with the wind,
2105	Upon supposed fairness, often known
2106	To be the dowry of a second head,
2107	The skull that bred them in the sepulchre.
2108	Thus ornament is but the guiled shore
2109	To a most dangerous sea; the beauteous scarf
2110	Veiling an Indian beauty; in a word,
2111	The seeming truth which cunning times put on
2112	To entrap the wisest. Therefore, thou gaudy gold,
2113	Hard food for Midas, I will none of thee;
2114	Nor none of thee, thou pale and common drudge
2115	'Tween man and man: but thou, thou meagre lead,
2116	Which rather threatenest than dost promise aught,
2117	Thy paleness moves me more than eloquence;
2118	And here choose I; joy be the consequence!
2119	
2120	PORTIA	[Aside]  How all the other passions fleet to air,
2121	As doubtful thoughts, and rash-embraced despair,
2122	And shuddering fear, and green-eyed jealousy! O love,
2123	Be moderate; allay thy ecstasy,
2124	In measure rein thy joy; scant this excess.
2125	I feel too much thy blessing: make it less,
2126	For fear I surfeit.
2127	
2128	BASSANIO	What find I here?
2129	
2130	[Opening the leaden casket]
2131	
2132	Fair Portia's counterfeit! What demi-god
2133	Hath come so near creation? Move these eyes?
2134	Or whether, riding on the balls of mine,
2135	Seem they in motion? Here are sever'd lips,
2136	Parted with sugar breath: so sweet a bar
2137	Should sunder such sweet friends. Here in her hairs
2138	The painter plays the spider and hath woven
2139	A golden mesh to entrap the hearts of men,
2140	Faster than gnats in cobwebs; but her eyes,--
2141	How could he see to do them? having made one,
2142	Methinks it should have power to steal both his
2143	And leave itself unfurnish'd. Yet look, how far
2144	The substance of my praise doth wrong this shadow
2145	In underprizing it, so far this shadow
2146	Doth limp behind the substance. Here's the scroll,
2147	The continent and summary of my fortune.
2148	
2149	[Reads]
2150	
2151	You that choose not by the view,
2152	Chance as fair and choose as true!
2153	Since this fortune falls to you,
2154	Be content and seek no new,
2155	If you be well pleased with this
2156	And hold your fortune for your bliss,
2157	Turn you where your lady is
2158	And claim her with a loving kiss.
2159	A gentle scroll. Fair lady, by your leave;
2160	I come by note, to give and to receive.
2161	Like one of two contending in a prize,
2162	That thinks he hath done well in people's eyes,
2163	Hearing applause and universal shout,
2164	Giddy in spirit, still gazing in a doubt
2165	Whether these pearls of praise be his or no;
2166	So, thrice fair lady, stand I, even so;
2167	As doubtful whether what I see be true,
2168	Until confirm'd, sign'd, ratified by you.
2169	
2170	PORTIA	You see me, Lord Bassanio, where I stand,
2171	Such as I am: though for myself alone
2172	I would not be ambitious in my wish,
2173	To wish myself much better; yet, for you
2174	I would be trebled twenty times myself;
2175	A thousand times more fair, ten thousand times more rich;
2176	That only to stand high in your account,
2177	I might in virtue, beauties, livings, friends,
2178	Exceed account; but the full sum of me
2179	Is sum of something, which, to term in gross,
2180	Is an unlesson'd girl, unschool'd, unpractised;
2181	Happy in this, she is not yet so old
2182	But she may learn; happier than this,
2183	She is not bred so dull but she can learn;
2184	Happiest of all is that her gentle spirit
2185	Commits itself to yours to be directed,
2186	As from her lord, her governor, her king.
2187	Myself and what is mine to you and yours
2188	Is now converted: but now I was the lord
2189	Of this fair mansion, master of my servants,
2190	Queen o'er myself: and even now, but now,
2191	This house, these servants and this same myself
2192	Are yours, my lord: I give them with this ring;
2193	Which when you part from, lose, or give away,
2194	Let it presage the ruin of your love
2195	And be my vantage to exclaim on you.
2196	
2197	BASSANIO	Madam, you have bereft me of all words,
2198	Only my blood speaks to you in my veins;
2199	And there is such confusion in my powers,
2200	As after some oration fairly spoke
2201	By a beloved prince, there doth appear
2202	Among the buzzing pleased multitude;
2203	Where every something, being blent together,
2204	Turns to a wild of nothing, save of joy,
2205	Express'd and not express'd. But when this ring
2206	Parts from this finger, then parts life from hence:
2207	O, then be bold to say Bassanio's dead!
2208	
2209	NERISSA	My lord and lady, it is now our time,
2210	That have stood by and seen our wishes prosper,
2211	To cry, good joy: good joy, my lord and lady!
2212	
2213	GRATIANO	My lord Bassanio and my gentle lady,
2214	I wish you all the joy that you can wish;
2215	For I am sure you can wish none from me:
2216	And when your honours mean to solemnize
2217	The bargain of your faith, I do beseech you,
2218	Even at that time I may be married too.
2219	
2220	BASSANIO	With all my heart, so thou canst get a wife.
2221	
2222	GRATIANO	I thank your lordship, you have got me one.
2223	My eyes, my lord, can look as swift as yours:
2224	You saw the mistress, I beheld the maid;
2225	You loved, I loved for intermission.
2226	No more pertains to me, my lord, than you.
2227	Your fortune stood upon the casket there,
2228	And so did mine too, as the matter falls;
2229	For wooing here until I sweat again,
2230	And sweating until my very roof was dry
2231	With oaths of love, at last, if promise last,
2232	I got a promise of this fair one here
2233	To have her love, provided that your fortune
2234	Achieved her mistress.
2235	
2236	PORTIA	Is this true, Nerissa?
2237	
2238	NERISSA	Madam, it is, so you stand pleased withal.
2239	
2240	BASSANIO	And do you, Gratiano, mean good faith?
2241	
2242	GRATIANO	Yes, faith, my lord.
2243	
2244	BASSANIO	Our feast shall be much honour'd in your marriage.
2245	
2246	GRATIANO	We'll play with them the first boy for a thousand ducats.
2247	
2248	NERISSA	What, and stake down?
2249	
2250	GRATIANO	No; we shall ne'er win at that sport, and stake down.
2251	But who comes here? Lorenzo and his infidel? What,
2252	and my old Venetian friend Salerio?
2253	
2254	[Enter LORENZO, JESSICA, and SALERIO, a Messenger
2255	from Venice]
2256	
2257	BASSANIO	Lorenzo and Salerio, welcome hither;
2258	If that the youth of my new interest here
2259	Have power to bid you welcome. By your leave,
2260	I bid my very friends and countrymen,
2261	Sweet Portia, welcome.
2262	
2263	PORTIA	So do I, my lord:
2264	They are entirely welcome.
2265	
2266	LORENZO	I thank your honour. For my part, my lord,
2267	My purpose was not to have seen you here;
2268	But meeting with Salerio by the way,
2269	He did entreat me, past all saying nay,
2270	To come with him along.
2271	
2272	SALERIO	I did, my lord;
2273	And I have reason for it. Signior Antonio
2274	Commends him to you.
2275	
2276	[Gives Bassanio a letter]
2277	
2278	BASSANIO	Ere I ope his letter,
2279	I pray you, tell me how my good friend doth.
2280	
2281	SALERIO	Not sick, my lord, unless it be in mind;
2282	Nor well, unless in mind: his letter there
2283	Will show you his estate.
2284	
2285	GRATIANO	Nerissa, cheer yon stranger; bid her welcome.
2286	Your hand, Salerio: what's the news from Venice?
2287	How doth that royal merchant, good Antonio?
2288	I know he will be glad of our success;
2289	We are the Jasons, we have won the fleece.
2290	
2291	SALERIO	I would you had won the fleece that he hath lost.
2292	
2293	PORTIA	There are some shrewd contents in yon same paper,
2294	That steals the colour from Bassanio's cheek:
2295	Some dear friend dead; else nothing in the world
2296	Could turn so much the constitution
2297	Of any constant man. What, worse and worse!
2298	With leave, Bassanio: I am half yourself,
2299	And I must freely have the half of anything
2300	That this same paper brings you.
2301	
2302	BASSANIO	O sweet Portia,
2303	Here are a few of the unpleasant'st words
2304	That ever blotted paper! Gentle lady,
2305	When I did first impart my love to you,
2306	I freely told you, all the wealth I had
2307	Ran in my veins, I was a gentleman;
2308	And then I told you true: and yet, dear lady,
2309	Rating myself at nothing, you shall see
2310	How much I was a braggart. When I told you
2311	My state was nothing, I should then have told you
2312	That I was worse than nothing; for, indeed,
2313	I have engaged myself to a dear friend,
2314	Engaged my friend to his mere enemy,
2315	To feed my means. Here is a letter, lady;
2316	The paper as the body of my friend,
2317	And every word in it a gaping wound,
2318	Issuing life-blood. But is it true, Salerio?
2319	Have all his ventures fail'd? What, not one hit?
2320	From Tripolis, from Mexico and England,
2321	From Lisbon, Barbary and India?
2322	And not one vessel 'scape the dreadful touch
2323	Of merchant-marring rocks?
2324	
2325	SALERIO	Not one, my lord.
2326	Besides, it should appear, that if he had
2327	The present money to discharge the Jew,
2328	He would not take it. Never did I know
2329	A creature, that did bear the shape of man,
2330	So keen and greedy to confound a man:
2331	He plies the duke at morning and at night,
2332	And doth impeach the freedom of the state,
2333	If they deny him justice: twenty merchants,
2334	The duke himself, and the magnificoes
2335	Of greatest port, have all persuaded with him;
2336	But none can drive him from the envious plea
2337	Of forfeiture, of justice and his bond.
2338	
2339	JESSICA	When I was with him I have heard him swear
2340	To Tubal and to Chus, his countrymen,
2341	That he would rather have Antonio's flesh
2342	Than twenty times the value of the sum
2343	That he did owe him: and I know, my lord,
2344	If law, authority and power deny not,
2345	It will go hard with poor Antonio.
2346	
2347	PORTIA	Is it your dear friend that is thus in trouble?
2348	
2349	BASSANIO	The dearest friend to me, the kindest man,
2350	The best-condition'd and unwearied spirit
2351	In doing courtesies, and one in whom
2352	The ancient Roman honour more appears
2353	Than any that draws breath in Italy.
2354	
2355	PORTIA	What sum owes he the Jew?
2356	
2357	BASSANIO	For me three thousand ducats.
2358	
2359	PORTIA	What, no more?
2360	Pay him six thousand, and deface the bond;
2361	Double six thousand, and then treble that,
2362	Before a friend of this description
2363	Shall lose a hair through Bassanio's fault.
2364	First go with me to church and call me wife,
2365	And then away to Venice to your friend;
2366	For never shall you lie by Portia's side
2367	With an unquiet soul. You shall have gold
2368	To pay the petty debt twenty times over:
2369	When it is paid, bring your true friend along.
2370	My maid Nerissa and myself meantime
2371	Will live as maids and widows. Come, away!
2372	For you shall hence upon your wedding-day:
2373	Bid your friends welcome, show a merry cheer:
2374	Since you are dear bought, I will love you dear.
2375	But let me hear the letter of your friend.
2376	
2377	BASSANIO	[Reads]  Sweet Bassanio, my ships have all
2378	miscarried, my creditors grow cruel, my estate is
2379	very low, my bond to the Jew is forfeit; and since
2380	in paying it, it is impossible I should live, all
2381	debts are cleared between you and I, if I might but
2382	see you at my death. Notwithstanding, use your
2383	pleasure: if your love do not persuade you to come,
2384	let not my letter.
2385	
2386	PORTIA	O love, dispatch all business, and be gone!
2387	
2388	BASSANIO	Since I have your good leave to go away,
2389	I will make haste: but, till I come again,
2390	No bed shall e'er be guilty of my stay,
2391	No rest be interposer 'twixt us twain.

2409	
2410	SHYLOCK	Gaoler, look to him: tell not me of mercy;
2411	This is the fool that lent out money gratis:
2412	Gaoler, look to him.
2413	
2414	ANTONIO	Hear me yet, good Shylock.
2415	
2416	SHYLOCK	I'll have my bond; speak not against my bond:
2417	I have sworn an oath that I will have my bond.
2418	Thou call'dst me dog before thou hadst a cause;
2419	But, since I am a dog, beware my fangs:
2420	The duke shall grant me justice. I do wonder,
2421	Thou naughty gaoler, that thou art so fond
2422	To come abroad with him at his request.
2423	
2424	ANTONIO	I pray thee, hear me speak.
2425	
2426	SHYLOCK	I'll have my bond; I will not hear thee speak:
2427	I'll have my bond; and therefore speak no more.
2428	I'll not be made a soft and dull-eyed fool,
2429	To shake the head, relent, and sigh, and yield
2430	To Christian intercessors. Follow not;
2431	I'll have no speaking: I will have my bond.
2432	
2433	[Exit]
2434	
2435	SALARINO	It is the most impenetrable cur
2436	That ever kept with men.
2437	
2438	ANTONIO	Let him alone:
2439	I'll follow him no more with bootless prayers.
2440	He seeks my life; his reason well I know:
2441	I oft deliver'd from his forfeitures
2442	Many that have at times made moan to me;
2443	Therefore he hates me.
2444	
2445	SALARINO	I am sure the duke
2446	Will never grant this forfeiture to hold.
2447	
2448	ANTONIO	The duke cannot deny the course of law:
2449	For the commodity that strangers have
2450	With us in Venice, if it be denied,
2451	Will much impeach the justice of his state;
2452	Since that the trade and profit of the city
2453	Consisteth of all nations. Therefore, go:
2454	These griefs and losses have so bated me,
2455	That I shall hardly spare a pound of flesh
2456	To-morrow to my bloody creditor.
2457	Well, gaoler, on. Pray God, Bassanio come
2458	To see me pay his debt, and then I care not!

2474	
2475	[Enter PORTIA, NERISSA, LORENZO, JESSICA, and
2476	BALTHASAR]
2477	
2478	LORENZO	Madam, although I speak it in your presence,
2479	You have a noble and a true conceit
2480	Of godlike amity; which appears most strongly
2481	In bearing thus the absence of your lord.
2482	But if you knew to whom you show this honour,
2483	How true a gentleman you send relief,
2484	How dear a lover of my lord your husband,
2485	I know you would be prouder of the work
2486	Than customary bounty can enforce you.
2487	
2488	PORTIA	I never did repent for doing good,
2489	Nor shall not now: for in companions
2490	That do converse and waste the time together,
2491	Whose souls do bear an equal yoke Of love,
2492	There must be needs a like proportion
2493	Of lineaments, of manners and of spirit;
2494	Which makes me think that this Antonio,
2495	Being the bosom lover of my lord,
2496	Must needs be like my lord. If it be so,
2497	How little is the cost I have bestow'd
2498	In purchasing the semblance of my soul
2499	From out the state of hellish misery!
2500	This comes too near the praising of myself;
2501	Therefore no more of it: hear other things.
2502	Lorenzo, I commit into your hands
2503	The husbandry and manage of my house
2504	Until my lord's return: for mine own part,
2505	I have toward heaven breathed a secret vow
2506	To live in prayer and contemplation,
2507	Only attended by Nerissa here,
2508	Until her husband and my lord's return:
2509	There is a monastery two miles off;
2510	And there will we abide. I do desire you
2511	Not to deny this imposition;
2512	The which my love and some necessity
2513	Now lays upon you.
2514	
2515	LORENZO	                  Madam, with all my heart;
2516	I shall obey you in all fair commands.
2517	
2518	PORTIA	My people do already know my mind,
2519	And will acknowledge you and Jessica
2520	In place of Lord Bassanio and myself.
2521	And so farewell, till we shall meet again.
2522	
2523	LORENZO	Fair thoughts and happy hours attend on you!
2524	
2525	JESSICA	I wish your ladyship all heart's content.
2526

2528	To wish it back on you: fare you well Jessica.
2529	
2530	[Exeunt JESSICA and LORENZO]
2531	
2532	Now, Balthasar,
2533	As I have ever found thee honest-true,
2534	So let me find thee still. Take this same letter,
2535	And use thou all the endeavour of a man
2536	In speed to Padua: see thou render this
2537	Into my cousin's hand, Doctor Bellario;
2538	And, look, what notes and garments he doth give thee,
2539	Bring them, I pray thee, with imagined speed
2540	Unto the tranect, to the common ferry
2541	Which trades to Venice. Waste no time in words,
2542	But get thee gone: I shall be there before thee.
2543	
2544	BALTHASAR	Madam, I go with all convenient speed.
2545	
2546	[Exit]
2547	
2548	PORTIA	Come on, Nerissa; I have work in hand
2549	That you yet know not of: we'll see our husbands
2550	Before they think of us.
2551	
2552	NERISSA	Shall they see us?
2553	
2554	PORTIA	They shall, Nerissa; but in such a habit,
2555	That they shall think we are accomplished
2556	With that we lack. I'll hold thee any wager,
2557	When we are both accoutred like young men,
2558	I'll prove the prettier fellow of the two,
2559	And wear my dagger with the braver grace,
2560	And speak between the change of man and boy
2561	With a reed voice, and turn two mincing steps
2562	Into a manly stride, and speak of frays
2563	Like a fine bragging youth, and tell quaint lies,
2564	How honourable ladies sought my love,
2565	Which I denying, they fell sick and died;
2566	I could not do withal; then I'll repent,
2567	And wish for all that, that I had not killed them;
2568	And twenty of these puny lies I'll tell,
2569	That men shall swear I have discontinued school
2570	Above a twelvemonth. I have within my mind
2571	A thousand raw tricks of these bragging Jacks,
2572	Which I will practise.
2573	
2574	NERISSA	Why, shall we turn to men?
2575	
2576	PORTIA	Fie, what a question's that,
2577	If thou wert near a lewd interpreter!
2578	But come, I'll tell thee all my whole device
2579	When I am in my coach, which stays for us
2580	At the park gate; and therefore haste away,
2581	For we must measure twenty miles to-day.

2596	
2597	
2598	[Enter LAUNCELOT and JESSICA]
2599	
2600	LAUNCELOT	Yes, truly; for, look you, the sins of the father
2601	are to be laid upon the children: therefore, I
2602	promise ye, I fear you. I was always plain with
2603	you, and so now I speak my agitation of the matter:
2604	therefore be of good cheer, for truly I think you
2605	are damned. There is but one hope in it that can do
2606	you any good; and that is but a kind of bastard
2607	hope neither.
2608	
2609	JESSICA	And what hope is that, I pray thee?
2610	
2611	LAUNCELOT	Marry, you may partly hope that your father got you
2612	not, that you are not the Jew's daughter.
2613	
2614	JESSICA	That were a kind of bastard hope, indeed: so the
2615	sins of my mother should be visited upon me.
2616	
2617	LAUNCELOT	Truly then I fear you are damned both by father and
2618	mother: thus when I shun Scylla, your father, I
2619	fall into Charybdis, your mother: well, you are
2620	gone both ways.
2621	
2622	JESSICA	I shall be saved by my husband; he hath made me a
2623	Christian.
2624	
2625	LAUNCELOT	Truly, the more to blame he: we were Christians
2626	enow before; e'en as many as could well live, one by
2627	another. This making Christians will raise the
2628	price of hogs: if we grow all to be pork-eaters, we
2629	shall not shortly have a rasher on the coals for money.
2630	
2631	[Enter LORENZO]
2632	
2633	JESSICA	I'll tell my husband, Launcelot, what you say: here he comes.
2634	
2635	LORENZO	I shall grow jealous of you shortly, Launcelot, if
2636	you thus get my wife into corners.
2637	
2638	JESSICA	Nay, you need not fear us, Lorenzo: Launcelot and I
2639	are out. He tells me flatly, there is no mercy for
2640	me in heaven, because I am a Jew's daughter: and he
2641	says, you are no good member of the commonwealth,
2642	for in converting Jews to Christians, you raise the
2643	price of pork.
2644	
2645	LORENZO	I shall answer that better to the commonwealth than
2646	you can the getting up of the negro's belly: the
2647	Moor is with child by you, Launcelot.
2648	
2649	LAUNCELOT	It is much that the Moor should be more than reason:
2650	but if she be less than an honest woman, she is
2651	indeed more than I took her for.
2652	
2653	LORENZO	How every fool can play upon the word! I think the
2654	best grace of wit will shortly turn into silence,
2655	and discourse grow commendable in none only but
2656	parrots. Go in, sirrah; bid them prepare for dinner.
2657	
2658	LAUNCELOT	That is done, sir; they have all stomachs.
2659	
2660	LORENZO	Goodly Lord, what a wit-snapper are you! then bid
2661	them prepare dinner.
2662	
2663	LAUNCELOT	That is done too, sir; only 'cover' is the word.
2664	
2665	LORENZO	Will you cover then, sir?
2666	
2667	LAUNCELOT	Not so, sir, neither; I know my duty.
2668	
2669	LORENZO	Yet more quarrelling with occasion! Wilt thou show
2670	the whole wealth of thy wit in an instant? I pray
2671	tree, understand a plain man in his plain meaning:
2672	go to thy fellows; bid them cover the table, serve
2673	in the meat, and we will come in to dinner.
2674	
2675	LAUNCELOT	For the table, sir, it shall be served in; for the
2676	meat, sir, it shall be covered; for your coming in
2677	to dinner, sir, why, let it be as humours and
2678	conceits shall govern.
2679	
2680	[Exit]
2681	
2682	LORENZO	O dear discretion, how his words are suited!
2683	The fool hath planted in his memory
2684	An army of good words; and I do know
2685	A many fools, that stand in better place,
2686	Garnish'd like him, that for a tricksy word
2687	Defy the matter. How cheerest thou, Jessica?
2688	And now, good sweet, say thy opinion,
2689	How dost thou like the Lord Bassanio's wife?
2690	
2691	JESSICA	Past all expressing. It is very meet
2692	The Lord Bassanio live an upright life;
2693	For, having such a blessing in his lady,
2694	He finds the joys of heaven here on earth;
2695	And if on earth he do not mean it, then
2696	In reason he should never come to heaven
2697	Why, if two gods should play some heavenly match
2698	And on the wager lay two earthly women,
2699	And Portia one, there must be something else
2700	Pawn'd with the other, for the poor rude world
2701	Hath not her fellow.
2702	
2703	LORENZO	Even such a husband
2704	Hast thou of me as she is for a wife.
2705	
2706	JESSICA	Nay, but ask my opinion too of that.
2707	
2708	LORENZO	I will anon: first, let us go to dinner.
2709	
2710	JESSICA	Nay, let me praise you while I have a stomach.
2711	
2712	LORENZO	No, pray thee, let it serve for table-talk;
2713	'	Then, howso'er thou speak'st, 'mong other things
2714	I shall digest it.
2715	
2716	JESSICA	                  Well, I'll set you forth.
2717	
2718	[Exeunt]
2719

2722	
2723	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
2724	
2725	
2726	ACT IV
2727	
2728	
2729	
2730	SCENE I	Venice. A court of justice.
2731	
2732	
2733	[Enter the DUKE, the Magnificoes, ANTONIO, BASSANIO,
2734	GRATIANO, SALERIO, and others]
2735	
2736	DUKE	What, is Antonio here?
2737	
2738	ANTONIO	Ready, so please your grace.
2739	
2740	DUKE	I am sorry for thee: thou art come to answer
2741	A stony adversary, an inhuman wretch
2742	uncapable of pity, void and empty
2743	From any dram of mercy.
2744	
2745	ANTONIO	I have heard
2746	Your grace hath ta'en great pains to qualify
2747	His rigorous course; but since he stands obdurate
2748	And that no lawful means can carry me
2749	Out of his envy's reach, I do oppose
2750	My patience to his fury, and am arm'd
2751	To suffer, with a quietness of spirit,
2752	The very tyranny and rage of his.
2753	
2754	DUKE	Go one, and call the Jew into the court.
2755	
2756	SALERIO	He is ready at the door: he comes, my lord.
2757	
2758	[Enter SHYLOCK]
2759	
2760	DUKE	Make room, and let him stand before our face.
2761	Shylock, the world thinks, and I think so too,
2762	That thou but lead'st this fashion of thy malice
2763	To the last hour of act; and then 'tis thought
2764	Thou'lt show thy mercy and remorse more strange
2765	Than is thy strange apparent cruelty;
2766	And where thou now exact'st the penalty,
2767	Which is a pound of this poor merchant's flesh,
2768	Thou wilt not only loose the forfeiture,
2769	But, touch'd with human gentleness and love,
2770	Forgive a moiety of the principal;
2771	Glancing an eye of pity on his losses,
2772	That have of late so huddled on his back,
2773	Enow to press a royal merchant down
2774	And pluck commiseration of his state
2775	From brassy bosoms and rough hearts of flint,
2776	From stubborn Turks and Tartars, never train'd
2777	To offices of tender courtesy.
2778	We all expect a gentle answer, Jew.
2779	
2780	SHYLOCK	I have possess'd your grace of what I purpose;
2781	And by our holy Sabbath have I sworn
2782	To have the due and forfeit of my bond:
2783	If you deny it, let the danger light
2784	Upon your charter and your city's freedom.
2785	You'll ask me, why I rather choose to have
2786	A weight of carrion flesh than to receive
2787	Three thousand ducats: I'll not answer that:
2788	But, say, it is my humour: is it answer'd?
2789	What if my house be troubled with a rat
2790	And I be pleased to give ten thousand ducats
2791	To have it baned? What, are you answer'd yet?
2792	Some men there are love not a gaping pig;
2793	Some, that are mad if they behold a cat;
2794	And others, when the bagpipe sings i' the nose,
2795	Cannot contain their urine: for affection,
2796	Mistress of passion, sways it to the mood
2797	Of what it likes or loathes. Now, for your answer:
2798	As there is no firm reason to be render'd,
2799	Why he cannot abide a gaping pig;
2800	Why he, a harmless necessary cat;
2801	Why he, a woollen bagpipe; but of force
2802	Must yield to such inevitable shame
2803	As to offend, himself being offended;
2804	So can I give no reason, nor I will not,
2805	More than a lodged hate and a certain loathing
2806	I bear Antonio, that I follow thus
2807	A losing suit against him. Are you answer'd?
2808	
2809	BASSANIO	This is no answer, thou unfeeling man,
2810	To excuse the current of thy cruelty.
2811	
2812	SHYLOCK	I am not bound to please thee with my answers.
2813	
2814	BASSANIO	Do all men kill the things they do not love?
2815	
2816	SHYLOCK	Hates any man the thing he would not kill?
2817	
2818	BASSANIO	Every offence is not a hate at first.
2819	
2820	SHYLOCK	What, wouldst thou have a serpent sting thee twice?
2821	
2822	ANTONIO	I pray you, think you question with the Jew:
2823	You may as well go stand upon the beach
2824	And bid the main flood bate his usual height;
2825	You may as well use question with the wolf
2826	Why he hath made the ewe bleat for the lamb;
2827	You may as well forbid the mountain pines
2828	To wag their high tops and to make no noise,
2829	When they are fretten with the gusts of heaven;
2830	You may as well do anything most hard,
2831	As seek to soften that--than which what's harder?--
2832	His Jewish heart: therefore, I do beseech you,
2833	Make no more offers, use no farther means,
2834	But with all brief and plain conveniency
2835	Let me have judgment and the Jew his will.
2836	
2837	BASSANIO	For thy three thousand ducats here is six.
2838	
2839	SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing
2840	Were in six parts and every part a ducat,
2841	I would not draw them; I would have my bond.
2842	
2843	DUKE	How shalt thou hope for mercy, rendering none?
2844	
2845	SHYLOCK	What judgment shall I dread, doing no wrong?
2846	You have among you many a purchased slave,
2847	Which, like your asses and your dogs and mules,
2848	You use in abject and in slavish parts,
2849	Because you bought them: shall I say to you,
2850	Let them be free, marry them to your heirs?
2851	Why sweat they under burthens? let their beds
2852	Be made as soft as yours and let their palates
2853	Be season'd with such viands? You will answer
2854	'The slaves are ours:' so do I answer you:
2855	The pound of flesh, which I demand of him,
2856	Is dearly bought; 'tis mine and I will have it.
2857	If you deny me, fie upon your law!
2858	There is no force in the decrees of Venice.
2859	I stand for judgment: answer; shall I have it?
2860	
2861	DUKE	Upon my power I may dismiss this court,
2862	Unless Bellario, a learned doctor,
2863	Whom I have sent for to determine this,
2864	Come here to-day.
2865	
2866	SALERIO	                  My lord, here stays without
2867	A messenger with letters from the doctor,
2868	New come from Padua.
2869	
2870	DUKE	Bring us the letter; call the messenger.
2871	
2872	BASSANIO	Good cheer, Antonio! What, man, courage yet!
2873	The Jew shall have my flesh, blood, bones and all,
2874	Ere thou shalt lose for me one drop of blood.
2875	
2876	ANTONIO	I am a tainted wether of the flock,
2877	Meetest for death: the weakest kind of fruit
2878	Drops earliest to the ground; and so let me
2879	You cannot better be employ'd, Bassanio,
2880	Than to live still and write mine epitaph.
2881	
2882	[Enter NERISSA, dressed like a lawyer's clerk]
2883	
2884	DUKE	Came you from Padua, from Bellario?
2885	
2886	NERISSA	From both, my lord. Bellario greets your grace.
2887	
2888	[Presenting a letter]
2889	
2890	BASSANIO	Why dost thou whet thy knife so earnestly?
2891	
2892	SHYLOCK	To cut the forfeiture from that bankrupt there.
2893	
2894	GRATIANO	Not on thy sole, but on thy soul, harsh Jew,
2895	Thou makest thy knife keen; but no metal can,
2896	No, not the hangman's axe, bear half the keenness
2897	Of thy sharp envy. Can no prayers pierce thee?
2898	
2899	SHYLOCK	No, none that thou hast wit enough to make.
2900	
2901	GRATIANO	O, be thou damn'd, inexecrable dog!
2902	And for thy life let justice be accused.
2903	Thou almost makest me waver in my faith
2904	To hold opinion with Pythagoras,
2905	That souls of animals infuse themselves
2906	Into the trunks of men: thy currish spirit
2907	Govern'd a wolf, who, hang'd for human slaughter,
2908	Even from the gallows did his fell soul fleet,
2909	And, whilst thou lay'st in thy unhallow'd dam,
2910	Infused itself in thee; for thy desires
2911	Are wolvish, bloody, starved and ravenous.
2912	
2913	SHYLOCK	Till thou canst rail the seal from off my bond,
2914	Thou but offend'st thy lungs to speak so loud:
2915	Repair thy wit, good youth, or it will fall
2916	To cureless ruin. I stand here for law.
2917	
2918	DUKE	This letter from Bellario doth commend
2919	A young and learned doctor to our court.
2920	Where is he?
2921	
2922	NERISSA	                  He attendeth here hard by,
2923	To know your answer, whether you'll admit him.
2924	
2925	DUKE	With all my heart. Some three or four of you
2926	Go give him courteous conduct to this place.
2927	Meantime the court shall hear Bellario's letter.
2928	
2929	Clerk	[Reads]
2930	
2931	Your grace shall understand that at the receipt of
2932	your letter I am very sick: but in the instant that
2933	your messenger came, in loving visitation was with
2934	me a young doctor of Rome; his name is Balthasar. I
2935	acquainted him with the cause in controversy between
2936	the Jew and Antonio the merchant: we turned o'er
2937	many books together: he is furnished with my
2938	opinion; which, bettered with his own learning, the
2939	greatness whereof I cannot enough commend, comes
2940	with him, at my importunity, to fill up your grace's
2941	request in my stead. I beseech you, let his lack of
2942	years be no impediment to let him lack a reverend
2943	estimation; for I never knew so young a body with so
2944	old a head. I leave him to your gracious
2945	acceptance, whose trial shall better publish his
2946	commendation.
2947	
2948	DUKE	You hear the learn'd Bellario, what he writes:
2949	And here, I take it, is the doctor come.
2950	
2951	[Enter PORTIA, dressed like a doctor of laws]
2952	
2953	Give me your hand. Come you from old Bellario?
2954	
2955	PORTIA	I did, my lord.
2956	
2957	DUKE	                  You are welcome: take your place.
2958	Are you acquainted with the difference
2959	That holds this present question in the court?
2960	
2961	PORTIA	I am informed thoroughly of the cause.
2962	Which is the merchant here, and which the Jew?
2963	
2964	DUKE	Antonio and old Shylock, both stand forth.
2965	
2966	PORTIA	Is your name Shylock?
2967	
2968	SHYLOCK	Shylock is my name.
2969	
2970	PORTIA	Of a strange nature is the suit you follow;
2971	Yet in such rule that the Venetian law
2972	Cannot impugn you as you do proceed.
2973	You stand within his danger, do you not?
2974	
2975	ANTONIO	Ay, so he says.
2976	
2977	PORTIA	                  Do you confess the bond?
2978	
2979	ANTONIO	I do.
2980	
2981	PORTIA	    Then must the Jew be merciful.
2982	
2983	SHYLOCK	On what compulsion must I? tell me that.
2984	
2985	PORTIA	The quality of mercy is not strain'd,
2986	It droppeth as the gentle rain from heaven
2987	Upon the place beneath: it is twice blest;
2988	It blesseth him that gives and him that takes:
2989	'Tis mightiest in the mightiest: it becomes
2990	The throned monarch better than his crown;
2991	His sceptre shows the force of temporal power,
2992	The attribute to awe and majesty,
2993	Wherein doth sit the dread and fear of kings;
2994	But mercy is above this sceptred sway;
2995	It is enthroned in the hearts of kings,
2996	It is an attribute to God himself;
2997	And earthly power doth then show likest God's
2998	When mercy seasons justice. Therefore, Jew,
2999	Though justice be thy plea, consider this,
3000	That, in the course of justice, none of us
3001	Should see salvation: we do pray for mercy;
3002	And that same prayer doth teach us all to render
3003	The deeds of mercy. I have spoke thus much
3004	To mitigate the justice of thy plea;
3005	Which if thou follow, this strict court of Venice
3006	Must needs give sentence 'gainst the merchant there.
3007	
3008	SHYLOCK	My deeds upon my head! I crave the law,
3009	The penalty and forfeit of my bond.
3010	
3011	PORTIA	Is he not able to discharge the money?
3012	
3013	BASSANIO	Yes, here I tender it for him in the court;
3014	Yea, twice the sum: if that will not suffice,
3015	I will be bound to pay it ten times o'er,
3016	On forfeit of my hands, my head, my heart:
3017	If this will not suffice, it must appear
3018	That malice bears down truth. And I beseech you,
3019	Wrest once the law to your authority:
3020	To do a great right, do a little wrong,
3021	And curb this cruel devil of his will.
3022	
3023	PORTIA	It must not be; there is no power in Venice
3024	Can alter a decree established:
3025	'Twill be recorded for a precedent,
3026	And many an error by the same example
3027	Will rush into the state: it cannot be.
3028	
3029	SHYLOCK	A Daniel come to judgment! yea, a Daniel!
3030	O wise young judge, how I do honour thee!
3031	
3032	PORTIA	I pray you, let me look upon the bond.
3033	
3034	SHYLOCK	Here 'tis, most reverend doctor, here it is.
3035	
3036	PORTIA	Shylock, there's thrice thy money offer'd thee.
3037	
3038	SHYLOCK	An oath, an oath, I have an oath in heaven:
3039	Shall I lay perjury upon my soul?
3040	No, not for Venice.
3041	
3042	PORTIA	Why, this bond is forfeit;
3043	And lawfully by this the Jew may claim
3044	A pound of flesh, to be by him cut off
3045	Nearest the merchant's heart. Be merciful:
3046	Take thrice thy money; bid me tear the bond.
3047	
3048	SHYLOCK	When it is paid according to the tenor.
3049	It doth appear you are a worthy judge;
3050	You know the law, your exposition
3051	Hath been most sound: I charge you by the law,
3052	Whereof you are a well-deserving pillar,
3053	Proceed to judgment: by my soul I swear
3054	There is no power in the tongue of man
3055	To alter me: I stay here on my bond.
3056	
3057	ANTONIO	Most heartily I do beseech the court
3058	To give the judgment.
3059	
3060	PORTIA	Why then, thus it is:
3061	You must prepare your bosom for his knife.
3062	
3063	SHYLOCK	O noble judge! O excellent young man!
3064	
3065	PORTIA	For the intent and purpose of the law
3066	Hath full relation to the penalty,
3067	Which here appeareth due upon the bond.
3068	
3069	SHYLOCK	'Tis very true: O wise and upright judge!
3070	How much more elder art thou than thy looks!
3071	
3072	PORTIA	Therefore lay bare your bosom.
3073	
3074	SHYLOCK	Ay, his breast:
3075	So says the bond: doth it not, noble judge?
3076	'Nearest his heart:' those are the very words.
3077	
3078	PORTIA	It is so. Are there balance here to weigh
3079	The flesh?
3080	
3081	SHYLOCK	         I have them ready.
3082	
3083	PORTIA	Have by some surgeon, Shylock, on your charge,
3084	To stop his wounds, lest he do bleed to death.
3085	
3086	SHYLOCK	Is it so nominated in the bond?
3087	
3088	PORTIA	It is not so express'd: but what of that?
3089	'Twere good you do so much for charity.
3090	
3091	SHYLOCK	I cannot find it; 'tis not in the bond.
3092	
3093	PORTIA	You, merchant, have you any thing to say?
3094	
3095	ANTONIO	But little: I am arm'd and well prepared.
3096	Give me your hand, Bassanio: fare you well!
3097	Grieve not that I am fallen to this for you;
3098	For herein Fortune shows herself more kind
3099	Than is her custom: it is still her use
3100	To let the wretched man outlive his wealth,
3101	To view with hollow eye and wrinkled brow
3102	An age of poverty; from which lingering penance
3103	Of such misery doth she cut me off.
3104	Commend me to your honourable wife:
3105	Tell her the process of Antonio's end;
3106	Say how I loved you, speak me fair in death;
3107	And, when the tale is told, bid her be judge
3108	Whether Bassanio had not once a love.
3109	Repent but you that you shall lose your friend,
3110	And he repents not that he pays your debt;
3111	For if the Jew do cut but deep enough,
3112	I'll pay it presently with all my heart.
3113	
3114	BASSANIO	Antonio, I am married to a wife
3115	Which is as dear to me as life itself;
3116	But life itself, my wife, and all the world,
3117	Are not with me esteem'd above thy life:
3118	I would lose all, ay, sacrifice them all
3119	Here to this devil, to deliver you.
3120	
3121	PORTIA	Your wife would give you little thanks for that,
3122	If she were by, to hear you make the offer.
3123	
3124	GRATIANO	I have a wife, whom, I protest, I love:
3125	I would she were in heaven, so she could
3126	Entreat some power to change this currish Jew.
3127	
3128	NERISSA	'Tis well you offer it behind her back;
3129	The wish would make else an unquiet house.
3130	
3131	SHYLOCK	These be the Christian husbands. I have a daughter;
3132	Would any of the stock of Barrabas
3133	Had been her husband rather than a Christian!
3134	
3135	[Aside]
3136	
3137	We trifle time: I pray thee, pursue sentence.
3138	
3139	PORTIA	A pound of that same merchant's flesh is thine:
3140	The court awards it, and the law doth give it.
3141	
3142	SHYLOCK	Most rightful judge!
3143	
3144	PORTIA	And you must cut this flesh from off his breast:
3145	The law allows it, and the court awards it.
3146	
3147	SHYLOCK	Most learned judge! A sentence! Come, prepare!
3148	
3149	PORTIA	Tarry a little; there is something else.
3150	This bond doth give thee here no jot of blood;
3151	The words expressly are 'a pound of flesh:'
3152	Take then thy bond, take thou thy pound of flesh;
3153	But, in the cutting it, if thou dost shed
3154	One drop of Christian blood, thy lands and goods
3155	Are, by the laws of Venice, confiscate
3156	Unto the state of Venice.
3157	
3158	GRATIANO	O upright judge! Mark, Jew: O learned judge!
3159	
3160	SHYLOCK	Is that the law?
3161	
3162	PORTIA	                  Thyself shalt see the act:
3163	For, as thou urgest justice, be assured
3164	Thou shalt have justice, more than thou desirest.
3165	
3166	GRATIANO	O learned judge! Mark, Jew: a learned judge!
3167	
3168	SHYLOCK	I take this offer, then; pay the bond thrice
3169	And let the Christian go.
3170	
3171	BASSANIO	Here is the money.
3172	
3173	PORTIA	Soft!
3174	The Jew shall have all justice; soft! no haste:
3175	He shall have nothing but the penalty.
3176	
3177	GRATIANO	O Jew! an upright judge, a learned judge!
3178	
3179	PORTIA	Therefore prepare thee to cut off the flesh.
3180	Shed thou no blood, nor cut thou less nor more
3181	But just a pound of flesh: if thou cut'st more
3182	Or less than a just pound, be it but so much
3183	As makes it light or heavy in the substance,
3184	Or the division of the twentieth part
3185	Of one poor scruple, nay, if the scale do turn
3186	But in the estimation of a hair,
3187	Thou diest and all thy goods are confiscate.
3188	
3189	GRATIANO	A second Daniel, a Daniel, Jew!
3190	Now, infidel, I have you on the hip.
3191	
3192	PORTIA	Why doth the Jew pause? take thy forfeiture.
3193	
3194	SHYLOCK	Give me my principal, and let me go.
3195	
3196	BASSANIO	I have it ready for thee; here it is.
3197	
3198	PORTIA	He hath refused it in the open court:
3199	He shall have merely justice and his bond.
3200	
3201	GRATIANO	A Daniel, still say I, a second Daniel!
3202	I thank thee, Jew, for teaching me that word.
3203	
3204	SHYLOCK	Shall I not have barely my principal?
3205	
3206	PORTIA	Thou shalt have nothing but the forfeiture,
3207	To be so taken at thy peril, Jew.
3208	
3209	SHYLOCK	Why, then the devil give him good of it!
3210	I'll stay no longer question.
3211	
3212	PORTIA	Tarry, Jew:
3213	The law hath yet another hold on you.
3214	It is enacted in the laws of Venice,
3215	If it be proved against an alien
3216	That by direct or indirect attempts
3217	He seek the life of any citizen,
3218	The party 'gainst the which he doth contrive
3219	Shall seize one half his goods; the other half
3220	Comes to the privy coffer of the state;
3221	And the offender's life lies in the mercy
3222	Of the duke only, 'gainst all other voice.
3223	In which predicament, I say, thou stand'st;
3224	For it appears, by manifest proceeding,
3225	That indirectly and directly too
3226	Thou hast contrived against the very life
3227	Of the defendant; and thou hast incurr'd
3228	The danger formerly by me rehearsed.
3229	Down therefore and beg mercy of the duke.
3230	
3231	GRATIANO	Beg that thou mayst have leave to hang thyself:
3232	And yet, thy wealth being forfeit to the state,
3233	Thou hast not left the value of a cord;
3234	Therefore thou must be hang'd at the state's charge.
3235	
3236	DUKE	That thou shalt see the difference of our spirits,
3237	I pardon thee thy life before thou ask it:
3238	For half thy wealth, it is Antonio's;
3239	The other half comes to the general state,
3240	Which humbleness may drive unto a fine.
3241	
3242	PORTIA	Ay, for the state, not for Antonio.
3243	
3244	SHYLOCK	Nay, take my life and all; pardon not that:
3245	You take my house when you do take the prop
3246	That doth sustain my house; you take my life
3247	When you do take the means whereby I live.
3248	
3249	PORTIA	What mercy can you render him, Antonio?
3250	
3251	GRATIANO	A halter gratis; nothing else, for God's sake.
3252	
3253	ANTONIO	So please my lord the duke and all the court
3254	To quit the fine for one half of his goods,
3255	I am content; so he will let me have
3256	The other half in use, to render it,
3257	Upon his death, unto the gentleman
3258	That lately stole his daughter:
3259	Two things provided more, that, for this favour,
3260	He presently become a Christian;
3261	The other, that he do record a gift,
3262	Here in the court, of all he dies possess'd,
3263	Unto his son Lorenzo and his daughter.
3264	
3265	DUKE	He shall do this, or else I do recant
3266	The pardon that I late pronounced here.
3267	
3268	PORTIA	Art thou contented, Jew? what dost thou say?
3269	
3270	SHYLOCK	I am content.
3271	
3272	PORTIA	                  Clerk, draw a deed of gift.
3273	
3274	SHYLOCK	I pray you, give me leave to go from hence;
3275	I am not well: send the deed after me,
3276	And I will sign it.
3277	
3278	DUKE	Get thee gone, but do it.
3279	
3280	GRATIANO	In christening shalt thou have two god-fathers:
3281	Had I been judge, thou shouldst have had ten more,
3282	To bring thee to the gallows, not the font.
3283	
3284	[Exit SHYLOCK]
3285	
3286	DUKE	Sir, I entreat you home with me to dinner.
3287	
3288	PORTIA	I humbly do desire your grace of pardon:
3289	I must away this night toward Padua,
3290	And it is meet I presently set forth.
3291	
3292	DUKE	I am sorry that your leisure serves you not.
3293	Antonio, gratify this gentleman,
3294	For, in my mind, you are much bound to him.
3295	
3296	[Exeunt Duke and his train]
3297	
3298	BASSANIO	Most worthy gentleman, I and my friend
3299	Have by your wisdom been this day acquitted
3300	Of grievous penalties; in lieu whereof,
3301	Three thousand ducats, due unto the Jew,
3302	We freely cope your courteous pains withal.
3303	
3304	ANTONIO	And stand indebted, over and above,
3305	In love and service to you evermore.
3306	
3307	PORTIA	He is well paid that is well satisfied;
3308	And I, delivering you, am satisfied
3309	And therein do account myself well paid:
3310	My mind was never yet more mercenary.
3311	I pray you, know me when we meet again:
3312	I wish you well, and so I take my leave.
3313	
3314	BASSANIO	Dear sir, of force I must attempt you further:
3315	Take some remembrance of us, as a tribute,
3316	Not as a fee: grant me two things, I pray you,
3317	Not to deny me, and to pardon me.
3318	
3319	PORTIA	You press me far, and therefore I will yield.
3320	
3321	[To ANTONIO]
3322	
3323	Give me your gloves, I'll wear them for your sake;
3324	
3325	[To BASSANIO]
3326	
3327	And, for your love, I'll take this ring from you:
3328	Do not draw back your hand; I'll take no more;
3329	And you in love shall not deny me this.
3330	
3331	BASSANIO	This ring, good sir, alas, it is a trifle!
3332	I will not shame myself to give you this.
3333	
3334	PORTIA	I will have nothing else but only this;
3335	And now methinks I have a mind to it.
3336	
3337	BASSANIO	There's more depends on this than on the value.
3338	The dearest ring in Venice will I give you,
3339	And find it out by proclamation:
3340	Only for this, I pray you, pardon me.
3341	
3342	PORTIA	I see, sir, you are liberal in offers
3343	You taught me first to beg; and now methinks
3344	You teach me how a beggar should be answer'd.
3345	
3346	BASSANIO	Good sir, this ring was given me by my wife;
3347	And when she put it on, she made me vow
3348	That I should neither sell nor give nor lose it.
3349	
3350	PORTIA	That 'scuse serves many men to save their gifts.
3351	An if your wife be not a mad-woman,
3352	And know how well I have deserved the ring,
3353	She would not hold out enemy for ever,
3354	For giving it to me. Well, peace be with you!
3355	
3356	[Exeunt Portia and Nerissa]
3357	
3358	ANTONIO	My Lord Bassanio, let him have the ring:
3359	Let his deservings and my love withal
3360	Be valued against your wife's commandment.
3361	
3362	BASSANIO	Go, Gratiano, run and overtake him;
3363	Give him the ring, and bring him, if thou canst,
3364	Unto Antonio's house: away! make haste.
3365	
3366	[Exit Gratiano]
3367	
3368	Come, you and I will thither presently;
3369	And in the morning early will we both
3370	Fly toward Belmont: come, Antonio.
3371	
3372	[Exeunt]
3373

3377	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
3378	
3379	
3380	ACT IV
3381	
3382	
3383	
3384	SCENE II	The same. A street.
3385	
3386	
3387	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]
3388	
3389	PORTIA	Inquire the Jew's house out, give him this deed
3390	And let him sign it: we'll away to-night
3391	And be a day before our husbands home:
3392	This deed will be well welcome to Lorenzo.
3393	
3394	[Enter GRATIANO]
3395	
3396	GRATIANO	Fair sir, you are well o'erta'en
3397	My Lord Bassanio upon more advice
3398	Hath sent you here this ring, and doth entreat
3399	Your company at dinner.
3400	
3401	PORTIA	That cannot be:
3402	His ring I do accept most thankfully:
3403	And so, I pray you, tell him: furthermore,
3404	I pray you, show my youth old Shylock's house.
3405	
3406	GRATIANO	That will I do.
3407	
3408	NERISSA	                  Sir, I would speak with you.
3409	
3410	[Aside to PORTIA]
3411	
3412	I'll see if I can get my husband's ring,
3413	Which I did make him swear to keep for ever.
3414	
3415	PORTIA	[Aside to NERISSA]  Thou mayst, I warrant.
3416	We shall have old swearing
3417	That they did give the rings away to men;
3418	But we'll outface them, and outswear them too.
3419	
3420	[Aloud]
3421	
3422	Away! make haste: thou knowist where I will tarry.
3423	
3424	NERISSA	Come, good sir, will you show me to this house?
3425	
3426	[Exeunt]

3431	THE MERCHANT OF VENICE
3432	
3433	
3434	ACT V
3435	
3436	
3437	
3438	SCENE I	Belmont. Avenue to PORTIA'S house.
3439	
3440	
3441	[Enter LORENZO and JESSICA]
3442	
3443	LORENZO	The moon shines bright: in such a night as this,
3444	When the sweet wind did gently kiss the trees
3445	And they did make no noise, in such a night
3446	Troilus methinks mounted the Troyan walls
3447	And sigh'd his soul toward the Grecian tents,
3448	Where Cressid lay that night.
3449	
3450	JESSICA	In such a night
3451	Did Thisbe fearfully o'ertrip the dew
3452	And saw the lion's shadow ere himself
3453	And ran dismay'd away.
3454	
3455	LORENZO	In such a night
3456	Stood Dido with a willow in her hand
3457	Upon the wild sea banks and waft her love
3458	To come again to Carthage.
3459	
3460	JESSICA	In such a night
3461	Medea gather'd the enchanted herbs
3462	That did renew old AEson.
3463	
3464	LORENZO	In such a night
3465	Did Jessica steal from the wealthy Jew
3466	And with an unthrift love did run from Venice
3467	As far as Belmont.
3468	
3469	JESSICA	                  In such a night
3470	Did young Lorenzo swear he loved her well,
3471	Stealing her soul with many vows of faith
3472	And ne'er a true one.
3473	
3474	LORENZO	In such a night
3475	Did pretty Jessica, like a little shrew,
3476	Slander her love, and he forgave it her.
3477	
3478	JESSICA	I would out-night you, did no body come;
3479	But, hark, I hear the footing of a man.
3480	
3481	[Enter STEPHANO]
3482	
3483	LORENZO	Who comes so fast in silence of the night?
3484	
3485	STEPHANO	A friend.
3486	
3487	LORENZO	A friend! what friend? your name, I pray you, friend?
3488	
3489	STEPHANO	Stephano is my name; and I bring word
3490	My mistress will before the break of day
3491	Be here at Belmont; she doth stray about
3492	By holy crosses, where she kneels and prays
3493	For happy wedlock hours.
3494	
3495	LORENZO	Who comes with her?
3496	
3497	STEPHANO	None but a holy hermit and her maid.
3498	I pray you, is my master yet return'd?
3499	
3500	LORENZO	He is not, nor we have not heard from him.
3501	But go we in, I pray thee, Jessica,
3502	And ceremoniously let us prepare
3503	Some welcome for the mistress of the house.
3504	
3505	[Enter LAUNCELOT]
3506	
3507	LAUNCELOT	Sola, sola! wo ha, ho! sola, sola!
3508	
3509	LORENZO	Who calls?
3510	
3511	LAUNCELOT	Sola! did you see Master Lorenzo?
3512	Master Lorenzo, sola, sola!
3513	
3514	LORENZO	Leave hollaing, man: here.
3515	
3516	LAUNCELOT	Sola! where? where?
3517	
3518	LORENZO	Here.
3519	
3520	LAUNCELOT	Tell him there's a post come from my master, with
3521	his horn full of good news: my master will be here
3522	ere morning.
3523	
3524	[Exit]
3525	
3526	LORENZO	Sweet soul, let's in, and there expect their coming.
3527	And yet no matter: why should we go in?
3528	My friend Stephano, signify, I pray you,
3529	Within the house, your mistress is at hand;
3530	And bring your music forth into the air.
3531	
3532	[Exit Stephano]
3533	
3534	How sweet the moonlight sleeps upon this bank!
3535	Here will we sit and let the sounds of music
3536	Creep in our ears: soft stillness and the night
3537	Become the touches of sweet harmony.
3538	Sit, Jessica. Look how the floor of heaven
3539	Is thick inlaid with patines of bright gold:
3540	There's not the smallest orb which thou behold'st
3541	But in his motion like an angel sings,
3542	Still quiring to the young-eyed cherubins;
3543	Such harmony is in immortal souls;
3544	But whilst this muddy vesture of decay
3545	Doth grossly close it in, we cannot hear it.
3546	
3547	[Enter Musicians]
3548	
3549	Come, ho! and wake Diana with a hymn!
3550	With sweetest touches pierce your mistress' ear,
3551	And draw her home with music.
3552	
3553	[Music]
3554	
3555	JESSICA	I am never merry when I hear sweet music.
3556	
3557	LORENZO	The reason is, your spirits are attentive:
3558	For do but note a wild and wanton herd,
3559	Or race of youthful and unhandled colts,
3560	Fetching mad bounds, bellowing and neighing loud,
3561	Which is the hot condition of their blood;
3562	If they but hear perchance a trumpet sound,
3563	Or any air of music touch their ears,
3564	You shall perceive them make a mutual stand,
3565	Their savage eyes turn'd to a modest gaze
3566	By the sweet power of music: therefore the poet
3567	Did feign that Orpheus drew trees, stones and floods;
3568	Since nought so stockish, hard and full of rage,
3569	But music for the time doth change his nature.
3570	The man that hath no music in himself,
3571	Nor is not moved with concord of sweet sounds,
3572	Is fit for treasons, stratagems and spoils;
3573	The motions of his spirit are dull as night
3574	And his affections dark as Erebus:
3575	Let no such man be trusted. Mark the music.
3576	
3577	[Enter PORTIA and NERISSA]
3578	
3579	PORTIA	That light we see is burning in my hall.
3580	How far that little candle throws his beams!
3581	So shines a good deed in a naughty world.
3582	
3583	NERISSA	When the moon shone, we did not see the candle.
3584	
3585	PORTIA	So doth the greater glory dim the less:
3586	A substitute shines brightly as a king
3587	Unto the king be by, and then his state
3588	Empties itself, as doth an inland brook
3589	Into the main of waters. Music! hark!
3590	
3591	NERISSA	It is your music, madam, of the house.
3592	
3593	PORTIA	Nothing is good, I see, without respect:
3594	Methinks it sounds much sweeter than by day.
3595	
3596	NERISSA	Silence bestows that virtue on it, madam.
3597	
3598	PORTIA	The crow doth sing as sweetly as the lark,
3599	When neither is attended, and I think
3600	The nightingale, if she should sing by day,
3601	When every goose is cackling, would be thought
3602	No better a musician than the wren.
3603	How many things by season season'd are
3604	To their right praise and true perfection!
3605	Peace, ho! the moon sleeps with Endymion
3606	And would not be awaked.
3607	
3608	[Music ceases]
3609	
3610	LORENZO	That is the voice,
3611	Or I am much deceived, of Portia.
3612	
3613	PORTIA	He knows me as the blind man knows the cuckoo,
3614	By the bad voice.
3615	
3616	LORENZO	                  Dear lady, welcome home.
3617	
3618	PORTIA	We have been praying for our husbands' healths,
3619	Which speed, we hope, the better for our words.
3620	Are they return'd?
3621	
3622	LORENZO	                  Madam, they are not yet;
3623	But there is come a messenger before,
3624	To signify their coming.
3625	
3626	PORTIA	Go in, Nerissa;
3627	Give order to my servants that they take
3628	No note at all of our being absent hence;
3629	Nor you, Lorenzo; Jessica, nor you.
3630	
3631	[A tucket sounds]
3632	
3633	LORENZO	Your husband is at hand; I hear his trumpet:
3634	We are no tell-tales, madam; fear you not.
3635	
3636	PORTIA	This night methinks is but the daylight sick;
3637	It looks a little paler: 'tis a day,
3638	Such as the day is when the sun is hid.
3639	
3640	[Enter BASSANIO, ANTONIO, GRATIANO, and
3641	their followers]
3642	
3643	BASSANIO	We should hold day with the Antipodes,
3644	If you would walk in absence of the sun.
3645	
3646	PORTIA	Let me give light, but let me not be light;
3647	For a light wife doth make a heavy husband,
3648	And never be Bassanio so for me:
3649	But God sort all! You are welcome home, my lord.
3650	
3651	BASSANIO	I thank you, madam. Give welcome to my friend.
3652	This is the man, this is Antonio,
3653	To whom I am so infinitely bound.
3654	
3655	PORTIA	You should in all sense be much bound to him.
3656	For, as I hear, he was much bound for you.
3657	
3658	ANTONIO	No more than I am well acquitted of.
3659	
3660	PORTIA	Sir, you are very welcome to our house:
3661	It must appear in other ways than words,
3662	Therefore I scant this breathing courtesy.
3663	
3664	GRATIANO	[To NERISSA]  By yonder moon I swear you do me wrong;
3665	In faith, I gave it to the judge's clerk:
3666	Would he were gelt that had it, for my part,
3667	Since you do take it, love, so much at heart.
3668	
3669	PORTIA	A quarrel, ho, already! what's the matter?
3670	
3671	GRATIANO	About a hoop of gold, a paltry ring
3672	That she did give me, whose posy was
3673	For all the world like cutler's poetry
3674	Upon a knife, 'Love me, and leave me not.'
3675	
3676	NERISSA	What talk you of the posy or the value?
3677	You swore to me, when I did give it you,
3678	That you would wear it till your hour of death
3679	And that it should lie with you in your grave:
3680	Though not for me, yet for your vehement oaths,
3681	You should have been respective and have kept it.
3682	Gave it a judge's clerk! no, God's my judge,
3683	The clerk will ne'er wear hair on's face that had it.
3684	
3685	GRATIANO	He will, an if he live to be a man.
3686	
3687	NERISSA	Ay, if a woman live to be a man.
3688	
3689	GRATIANO	Now, by this hand, I gave it to a youth,
3690	A kind of boy, a little scrubbed boy,
3691	No higher than thyself; the judge's clerk,
3692	A prating boy, that begg'd it as a fee:
3693	I could not for my heart deny it him.
3694	
3695	PORTIA	You were to blame, I must be plain with you,
3696	To part so slightly with your wife's first gift:
3697	A thing stuck on with oaths upon your finger
3698	And so riveted with faith unto your flesh.
3699	I gave my love a ring and made him swear
3700	Never to part with it; and here he stands;
3701	I dare be sworn for him he would not leave it
3702	Nor pluck it from his finger, for the wealth
3703	That the world masters. Now, in faith, Gratiano,
3704	You give your wife too unkind a cause of grief:
3705	An 'twere to me, I should be mad at it.
3706	
3707	BASSANIO	[Aside]  Why, I were best to cut my left hand off
3708	And swear I lost the ring defending it.
3709	
3710	GRATIANO	My Lord Bassanio gave his ring away
3711	Unto the judge that begg'd it and indeed
3712	Deserved it too; and then the boy, his clerk,
3713	That took some pains in writing, he begg'd mine;
3714	And neither man nor master would take aught
3715	But the two rings.
3716	
3717	PORTIA	What ring gave you my lord?
3718	Not that, I hope, which you received of me.
3719	
3720	BASSANIO	If I could add a lie unto a fault,
3721	I would deny it; but you see my finger
3722	Hath not the ring upon it; it is gone.
3723	
3724	PORTIA	Even so void is your false heart of truth.
3725	By heaven, I will ne'er come in your bed
3726	Until I see the ring.
3727	
3728	NERISSA	Nor I in yours
3729	Till I again see mine.
3730	
3731	BASSANIO	Sweet Portia,
3732	If you did know to whom I gave the ring,
3733	If you did know for whom I gave the ring
3734	And would conceive for what I gave the ring
3735	And how unwillingly I left the ring,
3736	When nought would be accepted but the ring,
3737	You would abate the strength of your displeasure.
3738	
3739	PORTIA	If you had known the virtue of the ring,
3740	Or half her worthiness that gave the ring,
3741	Or your own honour to contain the ring,
3742	You would not then have parted with the ring.
3743	What man is there so much unreasonable,
3744	If you had pleased to have defended it
3745	With any terms of zeal, wanted the modesty
3746	To urge the thing held as a ceremony?
3747	Nerissa teaches me what to believe:
3748	I'll die for't but some woman had the ring.
3749	
3750	BASSANIO	No, by my honour, madam, by my soul,
3751	No woman had it, but a civil doctor,
3752	Which did refuse three thousand ducats of me
3753	And begg'd the ring; the which I did deny him
3754	And suffer'd him to go displeased away;
3755	Even he that did uphold the very life
3756	Of my dear friend. What should I say, sweet lady?
3757	I was enforced to send it after him;
3758	I was beset with shame and courtesy;
3759	My honour would not let ingratitude
3760	So much besmear it. Pardon me, good lady;
3761	For, by these blessed candles of the night,
3762	Had you been there, I think you would have begg'd
3763	The ring of me to give the worthy doctor.
3764	
3765	PORTIA	Let not that doctor e'er come near my house:
3766	Since he hath got the jewel that I loved,
3767	And that which you did swear to keep for me,
3768	I will become as liberal as you;
3769	I'll not deny him any thing I have,
3770	No, not my body nor my husband's bed:
3771	Know him I shall, I am well sure of it:
3772	Lie not a night from home; watch me like Argus:
3773	If you do not, if I be left alone,
3774	Now, by mine honour, which is yet mine own,
3775	I'll have that doctor for my bedfellow.
3776	
3777	NERISSA	And I his clerk; therefore be well advised
3778	How you do leave me to mine own protection.
3779	
3780	GRATIANO	Well, do you so; let not me take him, then;
3781	For if I do, I'll mar the young clerk's pen.
3782	
3783	ANTONIO	I am the unhappy subject of these quarrels.
3784	
3785	PORTIA	Sir, grieve not you; you are welcome notwithstanding.
3786	
3787	BASSANIO	Portia, forgive me this enforced wrong;
3788	And, in the hearing of these many friends,
3789	I swear to thee, even by thine own fair eyes,
3790	Wherein I see myself--
3791	
3792	PORTIA	Mark you but that!
3793	In both my eyes he doubly sees himself;
3794	In each eye, one: swear by your double self,
3795	And there's an oath of credit.
3796	
3797	BASSANIO	Nay, but hear me:
3798	Pardon this fault, and by my soul I swear
3799	I never more will break an oath with thee.
3800	
3801	ANTONIO	I once did lend my body for his wealth;
3802	Which, but for him that had your husband's ring,
3803	Had quite miscarried: I dare be bound again,
3804	My soul upon the forfeit, that your lord
3805	Will never more break faith advisedly.
3806	
3807	PORTIA	Then you shall be his surety. Give him this
3808	And bid him keep it better than the other.
3809	
3810	ANTONIO	Here, Lord Bassanio; swear to keep this ring.
3811	
3812	BASSANIO	By heaven, it is the same I gave the doctor!
3813	
3814	PORTIA	I had it of him: pardon me, Bassanio;
3815	For, by this ring, the doctor lay with me.
3816	
3817	NERISSA	And pardon me, my gentle Gratiano;
3818	For that same scrubbed boy, the doctor's clerk,
3819	In lieu of this last night did lie with me.
3820	
3821	GRATIANO	Why, this is like the mending of highways
3822	In summer, where the ways are fair enough:
3823	What, are we cuckolds ere we have deserved it?
3824	
3825	PORTIA	Speak not so grossly. You are all amazed:
3826	Here is a letter; read it at your leisure;
3827	It comes from Padua, from Bellario:
3828	There you shall find that Portia was the doctor,
3829	Nerissa there her clerk: Lorenzo here
3830	Shall witness I set forth as soon as you
3831	And even but now return'd; I have not yet
3832	Enter'd my house. Antonio, you are welcome;
3833	And I have better news in store for you
3834	Than you expect: unseal this letter soon;
3835	There you shall find three of your argosies
3836	Are richly come to harbour suddenly:
3837	You shall not know by what strange accident
3838	I chanced on this letter.
3839	
3840	ANTONIO	I am dumb.
3841	
3842	BASSANIO	Were you the doctor and I knew you not?
3843	
3844	GRATIANO	Were you the clerk that is to make me cuckold?
3845	
3846	NERISSA	Ay, but the clerk that never means to do it,
3847	Unless he live until he be a man.
3848	
3849	BASSANIO	Sweet doctor, you shall be my bed-fellow:
3850	When I am absent, then lie with my wife.
3851	
3852	ANTONIO	Sweet lady, you have given me life and living;
3853	For here I read for certain that my ships
3854	Are safely come to road.
3855	
3856	PORTIA	How now, Lorenzo!
3857	My clerk hath some good comforts too for you.
3858	
3859	NERISSA	Ay, and I'll give them him without a fee.
3860	There do I give to you and Jessica,
3861	From the rich Jew, a special deed of gift,
3862	After his death, of all he dies possess'd of.
3863	
3864	LORENZO	Fair ladies, you drop manna in the way
3865	Of starved people.
3866	
3867	PORTIA	                  It is almost morning,
3868	And yet I am sure you are not satisfied
3869	Of these events at full. Let us go in;
3870	And charge us there upon inter'gatories,
3871	And we will answer all things faithfully.
3872	
3873	GRATIANO	Let it be so: the first inter'gatory
3874	That my Nerissa shall be sworn on is,
3875	Whether till the next night she had rather stay,
3876	Or go to bed now, being two hours to day:
3877	But were the day come, I should wish it dark,
3878	That I were couching with the doctor's clerk.
3879	Well, while I live I'll fear no other thing
3880	So sore as keeping safe Nerissa's ring.
3881	
3882	[Exeunt]

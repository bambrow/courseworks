6	MR. W. H. ALL HAPPINESS
7	AND THAT ETERNITY
8	PROMISED BY
9	OUR EVER-LIVING POET WISHETH
10	THE WELL-WISHING
11	ADVENTURER IN
12	SETTING FORTH
13	T. T.

15	
16	I.
17	
18	FROM fairest creatures we desire increase,
19	That thereby beauty's rose might never die,
20	But as the riper should by time decease,
21	His tender heir might bear his memory:
22	But thou, contracted to thine own bright eyes,
23	Feed'st thy light'st flame with self-substantial fuel,
24	Making a famine where abundance lies,
25	Thyself thy foe, to thy sweet self too cruel.
26	Thou that art now the world's fresh ornament
27	And only herald to the gaudy spring,
28	Within thine own bud buriest thy content
29	And, tender churl, makest waste in niggarding.
30	Pity the world, or else this glutton be,
31	To eat the world's due, by the grave and thee.
32	
33	II.
34	
35	When forty winters shall beseige thy brow,
36	And dig deep trenches in thy beauty's field,
37	Thy youth's proud livery, so gazed on now,
38	Will be a tatter'd weed, of small worth held:
39	Then being ask'd where all thy beauty lies,
40	Where all the treasure of thy lusty days,
41	To say, within thine own deep-sunken eyes,
42	Were an all-eating shame and thriftless praise.
43	How much more praise deserved thy beauty's use,
44	If thou couldst answer 'This fair child of mine
45	Shall sum my count and make my old excuse,'
46	Proving his beauty by succession thine!
47	This were to be new made when thou art old,
48	And see thy blood warm when thou feel'st it cold.
49	
50	III.
51	
52	Look in thy glass, and tell the face thou viewest
53	Now is the time that face should form another;
54	Whose fresh repair if now thou not renewest,
55	Thou dost beguile the world, unbless some mother.
56	For where is she so fair whose unear'd womb
57	Disdains the tillage of thy husbandry?
58	Or who is he so fond will be the tomb
59	Of his self-love, to stop posterity?
60	Thou art thy mother's glass, and she in thee
61	Calls back the lovely April of her prime:
62	So thou through windows of thine age shall see
63	Despite of wrinkles this thy golden time.
64	But if thou live, remember'd not to be,
65	Die single, and thine image dies with thee.
66	
67	IV.
68	
69	Unthrifty loveliness, why dost thou spend
70	Upon thyself thy beauty's legacy?
71	Nature's bequest gives nothing but doth lend,
72	And being frank she lends to those are free.
73	Then, beauteous niggard, why dost thou abuse
74	The bounteous largess given thee to give?
75	Profitless usurer, why dost thou use
76	So great a sum of sums, yet canst not live?
77	For having traffic with thyself alone,
78	Thou of thyself thy sweet self dost deceive.
79	Then how, when nature calls thee to be gone,
80	What acceptable audit canst thou leave?
81	Thy unused beauty must be tomb'd with thee,
82	Which, used, lives th' executor to be.
83	
84	V.
85	
86	Those hours, that with gentle work did frame
87	The lovely gaze where every eye doth dwell,
88	Will play the tyrants to the very same
89	And that unfair which fairly doth excel:
90	For never-resting time leads summer on
91	To hideous winter and confounds him there;
92	Sap cheque'd with frost and lusty leaves quite gone,
93	Beauty o'ersnow'd and bareness every where:
94	Then, were not summer's distillation left,
95	A liquid prisoner pent in walls of glass,
96	Beauty's effect with beauty were bereft,
97	Nor it nor no remembrance what it was:
98	But flowers distill'd though they with winter meet,
99	Leese but their show; their substance still lives sweet.
100	
101	VI.
102	
103	Then let not winter's ragged hand deface
104	In thee thy summer, ere thou be distill'd:
105	Make sweet some vial; treasure thou some place
106	With beauty's treasure, ere it be self-kill'd.
107	That use is not forbidden usury,
108	Which happies those that pay the willing loan;
109	That's for thyself to breed another thee,
110	Or ten times happier, be it ten for one;
111	Ten times thyself were happier than thou art,
112	If ten of thine ten times refigured thee:
113	Then what could death do, if thou shouldst depart,
114	Leaving thee living in posterity?
115	Be not self-will'd, for thou art much too fair
116	To be death's conquest and make worms thine heir.
117	
118	VII.
119	
120	Lo! in the orient when the gracious light
121	Lifts up his burning head, each under eye
122	Doth homage to his new-appearing sight,
123	Serving with looks his sacred majesty;
124	And having climb'd the steep-up heavenly hill,
125	Resembling strong youth in his middle age,
126	yet mortal looks adore his beauty still,
127	Attending on his golden pilgrimage;
128	But when from highmost pitch, with weary car,
129	Like feeble age, he reeleth from the day,
130	The eyes, 'fore duteous, now converted are
131	From his low tract and look another way:
132	So thou, thyself out-going in thy noon,
133	Unlook'd on diest, unless thou get a son.
134	
135	VIII.
136	
137	Music to hear, why hear'st thou music sadly?
138	Sweets with sweets war not, joy delights in joy.
139	Why lovest thou that which thou receivest not gladly,
140	Or else receivest with pleasure thine annoy?
141	If the true concord of well-tuned sounds,
142	By unions married, do offend thine ear,
143	They do but sweetly chide thee, who confounds
144	In singleness the parts that thou shouldst bear.
145	Mark how one string, sweet husband to another,
146	Strikes each in each by mutual ordering,
147	Resembling sire and child and happy mother
148	Who all in one, one pleasing note do sing:
149	Whose speechless song, being many, seeming one,
150	Sings this to thee: 'thou single wilt prove none.'
151	
152	IX.
153	
154	Is it for fear to wet a widow's eye
155	That thou consumest thyself in single life?
156	Ah! if thou issueless shalt hap to die.
157	The world will wail thee, like a makeless wife;
158	The world will be thy widow and still weep
159	That thou no form of thee hast left behind,
160	When every private widow well may keep
161	By children's eyes her husband's shape in mind.
162	Look, what an unthrift in the world doth spend
163	Shifts but his place, for still the world enjoys it;
164	But beauty's waste hath in the world an end,
165	And kept unused, the user so destroys it.
166	No love toward others in that bosom sits
167	That on himself such murderous shame commits.
168	
169	X.
170	
171	For shame! deny that thou bear'st love to any,
172	Who for thyself art so unprovident.
173	Grant, if thou wilt, thou art beloved of many,
174	But that thou none lovest is most evident;
175	For thou art so possess'd with murderous hate
176	That 'gainst thyself thou stick'st not to conspire.
177	Seeking that beauteous roof to ruinate
178	Which to repair should be thy chief desire.
179	O, change thy thought, that I may change my mind!
180	Shall hate be fairer lodged than gentle love?
181	Be, as thy presence is, gracious and kind,
182	Or to thyself at least kind-hearted prove:
183	Make thee another self, for love of me,
184	That beauty still may live in thine or thee.
185	
186	XI.
187	
188	As fast as thou shalt wane, so fast thou growest
189	In one of thine, from that which thou departest;
190	And that fresh blood which youngly thou bestowest
191	Thou mayst call thine when thou from youth convertest.
192	Herein lives wisdom, beauty and increase:
193	Without this, folly, age and cold decay:
194	If all were minded so, the times should cease
195	And threescore year would make the world away.
196	Let those whom Nature hath not made for store,
197	Harsh featureless and rude, barrenly perish:
198	Look, whom she best endow'd she gave the more;
199	Which bounteous gift thou shouldst in bounty cherish:
200	She carved thee for her seal, and meant thereby
201	Thou shouldst print more, not let that copy die.
202	
203	XII.
204	
205	When I do count the clock that tells the time,
206	And see the brave day sunk in hideous night;
207	When I behold the violet past prime,
208	And sable curls all silver'd o'er with white;
209	When lofty trees I see barren of leaves
210	Which erst from heat did canopy the herd,
211	And summer's green all girded up in sheaves
212	Borne on the bier with white and bristly beard,
213	Then of thy beauty do I question make,
214	That thou among the wastes of time must go,
215	Since sweets and beauties do themselves forsake
216	And die as fast as they see others grow;
217	And nothing 'gainst Time's scythe can make defence
218	Save breed, to brave him when he takes thee hence.
219	
220	XIII.
221	
222	O, that you were yourself! but, love, you are
223	No longer yours than you yourself here live:
224	Against this coming end you should prepare,
225	And your sweet semblance to some other give.
226	So should that beauty which you hold in lease
227	Find no determination: then you were
228	Yourself again after yourself's decease,
229	When your sweet issue your sweet form should bear.
230	Who lets so fair a house fall to decay,
231	Which husbandry in honour might uphold
232	Against the stormy gusts of winter's day
233	And barren rage of death's eternal cold?
234	O, none but unthrifts! Dear my love, you know
235	You had a father: let your son say so.
236	
237	XIV.
238	
239	Not from the stars do I my judgment pluck;
240	And yet methinks I have astronomy,
241	But not to tell of good or evil luck,
242	Of plagues, of dearths, or seasons' quality;
243	Nor can I fortune to brief minutes tell,
244	Pointing to each his thunder, rain and wind,
245	Or say with princes if it shall go well,
246	By oft predict that I in heaven find:
247	But from thine eyes my knowledge I derive,
248	And, constant stars, in them I read such art
249	As truth and beauty shall together thrive,
250	If from thyself to store thou wouldst convert;
251	Or else of thee this I prognosticate:
252	Thy end is truth's and beauty's doom and date.
253	
254	XV.
255	
256	When I consider every thing that grows
257	Holds in perfection but a little moment,
258	That this huge stage presenteth nought but shows
259	Whereon the stars in secret influence comment;
260	When I perceive that men as plants increase,
261	Cheered and cheque'd even by the self-same sky,
262	Vaunt in their youthful sap, at height decrease,
263	And wear their brave state out of memory;
264	Then the conceit of this inconstant stay
265	Sets you most rich in youth before my sight,
266	Where wasteful Time debateth with Decay,
267	To change your day of youth to sullied night;
268	And all in war with Time for love of you,
269	As he takes from you, I engraft you new.
270	
271	XVI.
272	
273	But wherefore do not you a mightier way
274	Make war upon this bloody tyrant, Time?
275	And fortify yourself in your decay
276	With means more blessed than my barren rhyme?
277	Now stand you on the top of happy hours,
278	And many maiden gardens yet unset
279	With virtuous wish would bear your living flowers,
280	Much liker than your painted counterfeit:
281	So should the lines of life that life repair,
282	Which this, Time's pencil, or my pupil pen,
283	Neither in inward worth nor outward fair,
284	Can make you live yourself in eyes of men.
285	To give away yourself keeps yourself still,
286	And you must live, drawn by your own sweet skill.
287	
288	XVII.
289	
290	Who will believe my verse in time to come,
291	If it were fill'd with your most high deserts?
292	Though yet, heaven knows, it is but as a tomb
293	Which hides your life and shows not half your parts.
294	If I could write the beauty of your eyes
295	And in fresh numbers number all your graces,
296	The age to come would say 'This poet lies:
297	Such heavenly touches ne'er touch'd earthly faces.'
298	So should my papers yellow'd with their age
299	Be scorn'd like old men of less truth than tongue,
300	And your true rights be term'd a poet's rage
301	And stretched metre of an antique song:
302	But were some child of yours alive that time,
303	You should live twice; in it and in my rhyme.
304	
305	XVIII.
306	
307	Shall I compare thee to a summer's day?
308	Thou art more lovely and more temperate:
309	Rough winds do shake the darling buds of May,
310	And summer's lease hath all too short a date:
311	Sometime too hot the eye of heaven shines,
312	And often is his gold complexion dimm'd;
313	And every fair from fair sometime declines,
314	By chance or nature's changing course untrimm'd;
315	But thy eternal summer shall not fade
316	Nor lose possession of that fair thou owest;
317	Nor shall Death brag thou wander'st in his shade,
318	When in eternal lines to time thou growest:
319	So long as men can breathe or eyes can see,
320	So long lives this and this gives life to thee.
321	
322	XIX.
323	
324	Devouring Time, blunt thou the lion's paws,
325	And make the earth devour her own sweet brood;
326	Pluck the keen teeth from the fierce tiger's jaws,
327	And burn the long-lived phoenix in her blood;
328	Make glad and sorry seasons as thou fleets,
329	And do whate'er thou wilt, swift-footed Time,
330	To the wide world and all her fading sweets;
331	But I forbid thee one most heinous crime:
332	O, carve not with thy hours my love's fair brow,
333	Nor draw no lines there with thine antique pen;
334	Him in thy course untainted do allow
335	For beauty's pattern to succeeding men.
336	Yet, do thy worst, old Time: despite thy wrong,
337	My love shall in my verse ever live young.
338	
339	XX.
340	
341	A woman's face with Nature's own hand painted
342	Hast thou, the master-mistress of my passion;
343	A woman's gentle heart, but not acquainted
344	With shifting change, as is false women's fashion;
345	An eye more bright than theirs, less false in rolling,
346	Gilding the object whereupon it gazeth;
347	A man in hue, all 'hues' in his controlling,
348	Much steals men's eyes and women's souls amazeth.
349	And for a woman wert thou first created;
350	Till Nature, as she wrought thee, fell a-doting,
351	And by addition me of thee defeated,
352	By adding one thing to my purpose nothing.
353	But since she prick'd thee out for women's pleasure,
354	Mine be thy love and thy love's use their treasure.
355	
356	XXI.
357	
358	So is it not with me as with that Muse
359	Stirr'd by a painted beauty to his verse,
360	Who heaven itself for ornament doth use
361	And every fair with his fair doth rehearse
362	Making a couplement of proud compare,
363	With sun and moon, with earth and sea's rich gems,
364	With April's first-born flowers, and all things rare
365	That heaven's air in this huge rondure hems.
366	O' let me, true in love, but truly write,
367	And then believe me, my love is as fair
368	As any mother's child, though not so bright
369	As those gold candles fix'd in heaven's air:
370	Let them say more than like of hearsay well;
371	I will not praise that purpose not to sell.
372	
373	XXII.
374	
375	My glass shall not persuade me I am old,
376	So long as youth and thou are of one date;
377	But when in thee time's furrows I behold,
378	Then look I death my days should expiate.
379	For all that beauty that doth cover thee
380	Is but the seemly raiment of my heart,
381	Which in thy breast doth live, as thine in me:
382	How can I then be elder than thou art?
383	O, therefore, love, be of thyself so wary
384	As I, not for myself, but for thee will;
385	Bearing thy heart, which I will keep so chary
386	As tender nurse her babe from faring ill.
387	Presume not on thy heart when mine is slain;
388	Thou gavest me thine, not to give back again.
389	
390	XXIII.
391	
392	As an unperfect actor on the stage
393	Who with his fear is put besides his part,
394	Or some fierce thing replete with too much rage,
395	Whose strength's abundance weakens his own heart.
396	So I, for fear of trust, forget to say
397	The perfect ceremony of love's rite,
398	And in mine own love's strength seem to decay,
399	O'ercharged with burden of mine own love's might.
400	O, let my books be then the eloquence
401	And dumb presagers of my speaking breast,
402	Who plead for love and look for recompense
403	More than that tongue that more hath more express'd.
404	O, learn to read what silent love hath writ:
405	To hear with eyes belongs to love's fine wit.
406	
407	XXIV.
408	
409	Mine eye hath play'd the painter and hath stell'd
410	Thy beauty's form in table of my heart;
411	My body is the frame wherein 'tis held,
412	And perspective it is the painter's art.
413	For through the painter must you see his skill,
414	To find where your true image pictured lies;
415	Which in my bosom's shop is hanging still,
416	That hath his windows glazed with thine eyes.
417	Now see what good turns eyes for eyes have done:
418	Mine eyes have drawn thy shape, and thine for me
419	Are windows to my breast, where-through the sun
420	Delights to peep, to gaze therein on thee;
421	Yet eyes this cunning want to grace their art;
422	They draw but what they see, know not the heart.
423	
424	XXV.
425	
426	Let those who are in favour with their stars
427	Of public honour and proud titles boast,
428	Whilst I, whom fortune of such triumph bars,
429	Unlook'd for joy in that I honour most.
430	Great princes' favourites their fair leaves spread
431	But as the marigold at the sun's eye,
432	And in themselves their pride lies buried,
433	For at a frown they in their glory die.
434	The painful warrior famoused for fight,
435	After a thousand victories once foil'd,
436	Is from the book of honour razed quite,
437	And all the rest forgot for which he toil'd:
438	Then happy I, that love and am beloved
439	Where I may not remove nor be removed.
440	
441	XXVI.
442	
443	Lord of my love, to whom in vassalage
444	Thy merit hath my duty strongly knit,
445	To thee I send this written embassage,
446	To witness duty, not to show my wit:
447	Duty so great, which wit so poor as mine
448	May make seem bare, in wanting words to show it,
449	But that I hope some good conceit of thine
450	In thy soul's thought, all naked, will bestow it;
451	Till whatsoever star that guides my moving
452	Points on me graciously with fair aspect
453	And puts apparel on my tatter'd loving,
454	To show me worthy of thy sweet respect:
455	Then may I dare to boast how I do love thee;
456	Till then not show my head where thou mayst prove me.
457	
458	XXVII.
459	
460	Weary with toil, I haste me to my bed,
461	The dear repose for limbs with travel tired;
462	But then begins a journey in my head,
463	To work my mind, when body's work's expired:
464	For then my thoughts, from far where I abide,
465	Intend a zealous pilgrimage to thee,
466	And keep my drooping eyelids open wide,
467	Looking on darkness which the blind do see
468	Save that my soul's imaginary sight
469	Presents thy shadow to my sightless view,
470	Which, like a jewel hung in ghastly night,
471	Makes black night beauteous and her old face new.
472	Lo! thus, by day my limbs, by night my mind,
473	For thee and for myself no quiet find.
474	
475	XXVIII.
476	
477	How can I then return in happy plight,
478	That am debarr'd the benefit of rest?
479	When day's oppression is not eased by night,
480	But day by night, and night by day, oppress'd?
481	And each, though enemies to either's reign,
482	Do in consent shake hands to torture me;
483	The one by toil, the other to complain
484	How far I toil, still farther off from thee.
485	I tell the day, to please them thou art bright
486	And dost him grace when clouds do blot the heaven:
487	So flatter I the swart-complexion'd night,
488	When sparkling stars twire not thou gild'st the even.
489	But day doth daily draw my sorrows longer
490	And night doth nightly make grief's strength
491	seem stronger.
492	
493	XXIX.
494	
495	When, in disgrace with fortune and men's eyes,
496	I all alone beweep my outcast state
497	And trouble deal heaven with my bootless cries
498	And look upon myself and curse my fate,
499	Wishing me like to one more rich in hope,
500	Featured like him, like him with friends possess'd,
501	Desiring this man's art and that man's scope,
502	With what I most enjoy contented least;
503	Yet in these thoughts myself almost despising,
504	Haply I think on thee, and then my state,
505	Like to the lark at break of day arising
506	From sullen earth, sings hymns at heaven's gate;
507	For thy sweet love remember'd such wealth brings
508	That then I scorn to change my state with kings.
509	
510	XXX.
511	
512	When to the sessions of sweet silent thought
513	I summon up remembrance of things past,
514	I sigh the lack of many a thing I sought,
515	And with old woes new wail my dear time's waste:
516	Then can I drown an eye, unused to flow,
517	For precious friends hid in death's dateless night,
518	And weep afresh love's long since cancell'd woe,
519	And moan the expense of many a vanish'd sight:
520	Then can I grieve at grievances foregone,
521	And heavily from woe to woe tell o'er
522	The sad account of fore-bemoaned moan,
523	Which I new pay as if not paid before.
524	But if the while I think on thee, dear friend,
525	All losses are restored and sorrows end.
526	
527	XXXI.
528	
529	Thy bosom is endeared with all hearts,
530	Which I by lacking have supposed dead,
531	And there reigns love and all love's loving parts,
532	And all those friends which I thought buried.
533	How many a holy and obsequious tear
534	Hath dear religious love stol'n from mine eye
535	As interest of the dead, which now appear
536	But things removed that hidden in thee lie!
537	Thou art the grave where buried love doth live,
538	Hung with the trophies of my lovers gone,
539	Who all their parts of me to thee did give;
540	That due of many now is thine alone:
541	Their images I loved I view in thee,
542	And thou, all they, hast all the all of me.
543	
544	XXXII.
545	
546	If thou survive my well-contented day,
547	When that churl Death my bones with dust shall cover,
548	And shalt by fortune once more re-survey
549	These poor rude lines of thy deceased lover,
550	Compare them with the bettering of the time,
551	And though they be outstripp'd by every pen,
552	Reserve them for my love, not for their rhyme,
553	Exceeded by the height of happier men.
554	O, then vouchsafe me but this loving thought:
555	'Had my friend's Muse grown with this growing age,
556	A dearer birth than this his love had brought,
557	To march in ranks of better equipage:
558	But since he died and poets better prove,
559	Theirs for their style I'll read, his for his love.'
560	
561	XXXIII.
562	
563	Full many a glorious morning have I seen
564	Flatter the mountain-tops with sovereign eye,
565	Kissing with golden face the meadows green,
566	Gilding pale streams with heavenly alchemy;
567	Anon permit the basest clouds to ride
568	With ugly rack on his celestial face,
569	And from the forlorn world his visage hide,
570	Stealing unseen to west with this disgrace:
571	Even so my sun one early morn did shine
572	With all triumphant splendor on my brow;
573	But out, alack! he was but one hour mine;
574	The region cloud hath mask'd him from me now.
575	Yet him for this my love no whit disdaineth;
576	Suns of the world may stain when heaven's sun staineth.
577	
578	XXXIV.
579	
580	Why didst thou promise such a beauteous day,
581	And make me travel forth without my cloak,
582	To let base clouds o'ertake me in my way,
583	Hiding thy bravery in their rotten smoke?
584	'Tis not enough that through the cloud thou break,
585	To dry the rain on my storm-beaten face,
586	For no man well of such a salve can speak
587	That heals the wound and cures not the disgrace:
588	Nor can thy shame give physic to my grief;
589	Though thou repent, yet I have still the loss:
590	The offender's sorrow lends but weak relief
591	To him that bears the strong offence's cross.
592	Ah! but those tears are pearl which thy love sheds,
593	And they are rich and ransom all ill deeds.
594	
595	XXXV.
596	
597	No more be grieved at that which thou hast done:
598	Roses have thorns, and silver fountains mud;
599	Clouds and eclipses stain both moon and sun,
600	And loathsome canker lives in sweetest bud.
601	All men make faults, and even I in this,
602	Authorizing thy trespass with compare,
603	Myself corrupting, salving thy amiss,
604	Excusing thy sins more than thy sins are;
605	For to thy sensual fault I bring in sense--
606	Thy adverse party is thy advocate--
607	And 'gainst myself a lawful plea commence:
608	Such civil war is in my love and hate
609	That I an accessary needs must be
610	To that sweet thief which sourly robs from me.
611	
612	XXXVI.
613	
614	Let me confess that we two must be twain,
615	Although our undivided loves are one:
616	So shall those blots that do with me remain
617	Without thy help by me be borne alone.
618	In our two loves there is but one respect,
619	Though in our lives a separable spite,
620	Which though it alter not love's sole effect,
621	Yet doth it steal sweet hours from love's delight.
622	I may not evermore acknowledge thee,
623	Lest my bewailed guilt should do thee shame,
624	Nor thou with public kindness honour me,
625	Unless thou take that honour from thy name:
626	But do not so; I love thee in such sort
627	As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
628	
629	XXXVII.
630	
631	As a decrepit father takes delight
632	To see his active child do deeds of youth,
633	So I, made lame by fortune's dearest spite,
634	Take all my comfort of thy worth and truth.
635	For whether beauty, birth, or wealth, or wit,
636	Or any of these all, or all, or more,
637	Entitled in thy parts do crowned sit,
638	I make my love engrafted to this store:
639	So then I am not lame, poor, nor despised,
640	Whilst that this shadow doth such substance give
641	That I in thy abundance am sufficed
642	And by a part of all thy glory live.
643	Look, what is best, that best I wish in thee:
644	This wish I have; then ten times happy me!
645	
646	XXXVIII.
647	
648	How can my Muse want subject to invent,
649	While thou dost breathe, that pour'st into my verse
650	Thine own sweet argument, too excellent
651	For every vulgar paper to rehearse?
652	O, give thyself the thanks, if aught in me
653	Worthy perusal stand against thy sight;
654	For who's so dumb that cannot write to thee,
655	When thou thyself dost give invention light?
656	Be thou the tenth Muse, ten times more in worth
657	Than those old nine which rhymers invocate;
658	And he that calls on thee, let him bring forth
659	Eternal numbers to outlive long date.
660	If my slight Muse do please these curious days,
661	The pain be mine, but thine shall be the praise.
662	
663	XXXIX.
664	
665	O, how thy worth with manners may I sing,
666	When thou art all the better part of me?
667	What can mine own praise to mine own self bring?
668	And what is 't but mine own when I praise thee?
669	Even for this let us divided live,
670	And our dear love lose name of single one,
671	That by this separation I may give
672	That due to thee which thou deservest alone.
673	O absence, what a torment wouldst thou prove,
674	Were it not thy sour leisure gave sweet leave
675	To entertain the time with thoughts of love,
676	Which time and thoughts so sweetly doth deceive,
677	And that thou teachest how to make one twain,
678	By praising him here who doth hence remain!
679	
680	XL.
681	
682	Take all my loves, my love, yea, take them all;
683	What hast thou then more than thou hadst before?
684	No love, my love, that thou mayst true love call;
685	All mine was thine before thou hadst this more.
686	Then if for my love thou my love receivest,
687	I cannot blame thee for my love thou usest;
688	But yet be blamed, if thou thyself deceivest
689	By wilful taste of what thyself refusest.
690	I do forgive thy robbery, gentle thief,
691	Although thou steal thee all my poverty;
692	And yet, love knows, it is a greater grief
693	To bear love's wrong than hate's known injury.
694	Lascivious grace, in whom all ill well shows,
695	Kill me with spites; yet we must not be foes.
696	
697	XLI.
698	
699	Those petty wrongs that liberty commits,
700	When I am sometime absent from thy heart,
701	Thy beauty and thy years full well befits,
702	For still temptation follows where thou art.
703	Gentle thou art and therefore to be won,
704	Beauteous thou art, therefore to be assailed;
705	And when a woman woos, what woman's son
706	Will sourly leave her till she have prevailed?
707	Ay me! but yet thou mightest my seat forbear,
708	And chide try beauty and thy straying youth,
709	Who lead thee in their riot even there
710	Where thou art forced to break a twofold truth,
711	Hers by thy beauty tempting her to thee,
712	Thine, by thy beauty being false to me.
713	
714	XLII.
715	
716	That thou hast her, it is not all my grief,
717	And yet it may be said I loved her dearly;
718	That she hath thee, is of my wailing chief,
719	A loss in love that touches me more nearly.
720	Loving offenders, thus I will excuse ye:
721	Thou dost love her, because thou knowst I love her;
722	And for my sake even so doth she abuse me,
723	Suffering my friend for my sake to approve her.
724	If I lose thee, my loss is my love's gain,
725	And losing her, my friend hath found that loss;
726	Both find each other, and I lose both twain,
727	And both for my sake lay on me this cross:
728	But here's the joy; my friend and I are one;
729	Sweet flattery! then she loves but me alone.
730	
731	XLIII.
732	
733	When most I wink, then do mine eyes best see,
734	For all the day they view things unrespected;
735	But when I sleep, in dreams they look on thee,
736	And darkly bright are bright in dark directed.
737	Then thou, whose shadow shadows doth make bright,
738	How would thy shadow's form form happy show
739	To the clear day with thy much clearer light,
740	When to unseeing eyes thy shade shines so!
741	How would, I say, mine eyes be blessed made
742	By looking on thee in the living day,
743	When in dead night thy fair imperfect shade
744	Through heavy sleep on sightless eyes doth stay!
745	All days are nights to see till I see thee,
746	And nights bright days when dreams do show thee me.
747	
748	XLIV.
749	
750	If the dull substance of my flesh were thought,
751	Injurious distance should not stop my way;
752	For then despite of space I would be brought,
753	From limits far remote where thou dost stay.
754	No matter then although my foot did stand
755	Upon the farthest earth removed from thee;
756	For nimble thought can jump both sea and land
757	As soon as think the place where he would be.
758	But ah! thought kills me that I am not thought,
759	To leap large lengths of miles when thou art gone,
760	But that so much of earth and water wrought
761	I must attend time's leisure with my moan,
762	Receiving nought by elements so slow
763	But heavy tears, badges of either's woe.
764	
765	XLV.
766	
767	The other two, slight air and purging fire,
768	Are both with thee, wherever I abide;
769	The first my thought, the other my desire,
770	These present-absent with swift motion slide.
771	For when these quicker elements are gone
772	In tender embassy of love to thee,
773	My life, being made of four, with two alone
774	Sinks down to death, oppress'd with melancholy;
775	Until life's composition be recured
776	By those swift messengers return'd from thee,
777	Who even but now come back again, assured
778	Of thy fair health, recounting it to me:
779	This told, I joy; but then no longer glad,
780	I send them back again and straight grow sad.
781	
782	XLVI.
783	
784	Mine eye and heart are at a mortal war
785	How to divide the conquest of thy sight;
786	Mine eye my heart thy picture's sight would bar,
787	My heart mine eye the freedom of that right.
788	My heart doth plead that thou in him dost lie--
789	A closet never pierced with crystal eyes--
790	But the defendant doth that plea deny
791	And says in him thy fair appearance lies.
792	To 'cide this title is impanneled
793	A quest of thoughts, all tenants to the heart,
794	And by their verdict is determined
795	The clear eye's moiety and the dear heart's part:
796	As thus; mine eye's due is thy outward part,
797	And my heart's right thy inward love of heart.
798	
799	XLVII.
800	
801	Betwixt mine eye and heart a league is took,
802	And each doth good turns now unto the other:
803	When that mine eye is famish'd for a look,
804	Or heart in love with sighs himself doth smother,
805	With my love's picture then my eye doth feast
806	And to the painted banquet bids my heart;
807	Another time mine eye is my heart's guest
808	And in his thoughts of love doth share a part:
809	So, either by thy picture or my love,
810	Thyself away art resent still with me;
811	For thou not farther than my thoughts canst move,
812	And I am still with them and they with thee;
813	Or, if they sleep, thy picture in my sight
814	Awakes my heart to heart's and eye's delight.
815	
816	XLVIII.
817	
818	How careful was I, when I took my way,
819	Each trifle under truest bars to thrust,
820	That to my use it might unused stay
821	From hands of falsehood, in sure wards of trust!
822	But thou, to whom my jewels trifles are,
823	Most worthy of comfort, now my greatest grief,
824	Thou, best of dearest and mine only care,
825	Art left the prey of every vulgar thief.
826	Thee have I not lock'd up in any chest,
827	Save where thou art not, though I feel thou art,
828	Within the gentle closure of my breast,
829	From whence at pleasure thou mayst come and part;
830	And even thence thou wilt be stol'n, I fear,
831	For truth proves thievish for a prize so dear.
832	
833	XLIX.
834	
835	Against that time, if ever that time come,
836	When I shall see thee frown on my defects,
837	When as thy love hath cast his utmost sum,
838	Call'd to that audit by advised respects;
839	Against that time when thou shalt strangely pass
840	And scarcely greet me with that sun thine eye,
841	When love, converted from the thing it was,
842	Shall reasons find of settled gravity,--
843	Against that time do I ensconce me here
844	Within the knowledge of mine own desert,
845	And this my hand against myself uprear,
846	To guard the lawful reasons on thy part:
847	To leave poor me thou hast the strength of laws,
848	Since why to love I can allege no cause.
849	
850	L.
851	
852	How heavy do I journey on the way,
853	When what I seek, my weary travel's end,
854	Doth teach that ease and that repose to say
855	'Thus far the miles are measured from thy friend!'
856	The beast that bears me, tired with my woe,
857	Plods dully on, to bear that weight in me,
858	As if by some instinct the wretch did know
859	His rider loved not speed, being made from thee:
860	The bloody spur cannot provoke him on
861	That sometimes anger thrusts into his hide;
862	Which heavily he answers with a groan,
863	More sharp to me than spurring to his side;
864	For that same groan doth put this in my mind;
865	My grief lies onward and my joy behind.
866	
867	LI.
868	
869	Thus can my love excuse the slow offence
870	Of my dull bearer when from thee I speed:
871	From where thou art why should I haste me thence?
872	Till I return, of posting is no need.
873	O, what excuse will my poor beast then find,
874	When swift extremity can seem but slow?
875	Then should I spur, though mounted on the wind;
876	In winged speed no motion shall I know:
877	Then can no horse with my desire keep pace;
878	Therefore desire of perfect'st love being made,
879	Shall neigh--no dull flesh--in his fiery race;
880	But love, for love, thus shall excuse my jade;
881	Since from thee going he went wilful-slow,
882	Towards thee I'll run, and give him leave to go.
883	
884	LII.
885	
886	So am I as the rich, whose blessed key
887	Can bring him to his sweet up-locked treasure,
888	The which he will not every hour survey,
889	For blunting the fine point of seldom pleasure.
890	Therefore are feasts so solemn and so rare,
891	Since, seldom coming, in the long year set,
892	Like stones of worth they thinly placed are,
893	Or captain jewels in the carcanet.
894	So is the time that keeps you as my chest,
895	Or as the wardrobe which the robe doth hide,
896	To make some special instant special blest,
897	By new unfolding his imprison'd pride.
898	Blessed are you, whose worthiness gives scope,
899	Being had, to triumph, being lack'd, to hope.
900	
901	LIII.
902	
903	What is your substance, whereof are you made,
904	That millions of strange shadows on you tend?
905	Since every one hath, every one, one shade,
906	And you, but one, can every shadow lend.
907	Describe Adonis, and the counterfeit
908	Is poorly imitated after you;
909	On Helen's cheek all art of beauty set,
910	And you in Grecian tires are painted new:
911	Speak of the spring and foison of the year;
912	The one doth shadow of your beauty show,
913	The other as your bounty doth appear;
914	And you in every blessed shape we know.
915	In all external grace you have some part,
916	But you like none, none you, for constant heart.
917	
918	LIV.
919	
920	O, how much more doth beauty beauteous seem
921	By that sweet ornament which truth doth give!
922	The rose looks fair, but fairer we it deem
923	For that sweet odour which doth in it live.
924	The canker-blooms have full as deep a dye
925	As the perfumed tincture of the roses,
926	Hang on such thorns and play as wantonly
927	When summer's breath their masked buds discloses:
928	But, for their virtue only is their show,
929	They live unwoo'd and unrespected fade,
930	Die to themselves. Sweet roses do not so;
931	Of their sweet deaths are sweetest odours made:
932	And so of you, beauteous and lovely youth,
933	When that shall fade, my verse distills your truth.
934	
935	LV.
936	
937	Not marble, nor the gilded monuments
938	Of princes, shall outlive this powerful rhyme;
939	But you shall shine more bright in these contents
940	Than unswept stone besmear'd with sluttish time.
941	When wasteful war shall statues overturn,
942	And broils root out the work of masonry,
943	Nor Mars his sword nor war's quick fire shall burn
944	The living record of your memory.
945	'Gainst death and all-oblivious enmity
946	Shall you pace forth; your praise shall still find room
947	Even in the eyes of all posterity
948	That wear this world out to the ending doom.
949	So, till the judgment that yourself arise,
950	You live in this, and dwell in lover's eyes.
951	
952	LVI.
953	
954	Sweet love, renew thy force; be it not said
955	Thy edge should blunter be than appetite,
956	Which but to-day by feeding is allay'd,
957	To-morrow sharpen'd in his former might:
958	So, love, be thou; although to-day thou fill
959	Thy hungry eyes even till they wink with fullness,
960	To-morrow see again, and do not kill
961	The spirit of love with a perpetual dullness.
962	Let this sad interim like the ocean be
963	Which parts the shore, where two contracted new
964	Come daily to the banks, that, when they see
965	Return of love, more blest may be the view;
966	Else call it winter, which being full of care
967	Makes summer's welcome thrice more wish'd, more rare.
968	
969	LVII.
970	
971	Being your slave, what should I do but tend
972	Upon the hours and times of your desire?
973	I have no precious time at all to spend,
974	Nor services to do, till you require.
975	Nor dare I chide the world-without-end hour
976	Whilst I, my sovereign, watch the clock for you,
977	Nor think the bitterness of absence sour
978	When you have bid your servant once adieu;
979	Nor dare I question with my jealous thought
980	Where you may be, or your affairs suppose,
981	But, like a sad slave, stay and think of nought
982	Save, where you are how happy you make those.
983	So true a fool is love that in your will,
984	Though you do any thing, he thinks no ill.
985	
986	LVIII.
987	
988	That god forbid that made me first your slave,
989	I should in thought control your times of pleasure,
990	Or at your hand the account of hours to crave,
991	Being your vassal, bound to stay your leisure!
992	O, let me suffer, being at your beck,
993	The imprison'd absence of your liberty;
994	And patience, tame to sufferance, bide each cheque,
995	Without accusing you of injury.
996	Be where you list, your charter is so strong
997	That you yourself may privilege your time
998	To what you will; to you it doth belong
999	Yourself to pardon of self-doing crime.
1000	I am to wait, though waiting so be hell;
1001	Not blame your pleasure, be it ill or well.
1002	
1003	LIX.
1004	
1005	If there be nothing new, but that which is
1006	Hath been before, how are our brains beguiled,
1007	Which, labouring for invention, bear amiss
1008	The second burden of a former child!
1009	O, that record could with a backward look,
1010	Even of five hundred courses of the sun,
1011	Show me your image in some antique book,
1012	Since mind at first in character was done!
1013	That I might see what the old world could say
1014	To this composed wonder of your frame;
1015	Whether we are mended, or whether better they,
1016	Or whether revolution be the same.
1017	O, sure I am, the wits of former days
1018	To subjects worse have given admiring praise.
1019	
1020	LX.
1021	
1022	Like as the waves make towards the pebbled shore,
1023	So do our minutes hasten to their end;
1024	Each changing place with that which goes before,
1025	In sequent toil all forwards do contend.
1026	Nativity, once in the main of light,
1027	Crawls to maturity, wherewith being crown'd,
1028	Crooked elipses 'gainst his glory fight,
1029	And Time that gave doth now his gift confound.
1030	Time doth transfix the flourish set on youth
1031	And delves the parallels in beauty's brow,
1032	Feeds on the rarities of nature's truth,
1033	And nothing stands but for his scythe to mow:
1034	And yet to times in hope my verse shall stand,
1035	Praising thy worth, despite his cruel hand.
1036	
1037	LXI.
1038	
1039	Is it thy will thy image should keep open
1040	My heavy eyelids to the weary night?
1041	Dost thou desire my slumbers should be broken,
1042	While shadows like to thee do mock my sight?
1043	Is it thy spirit that thou send'st from thee
1044	So far from home into my deeds to pry,
1045	To find out shames and idle hours in me,
1046	The scope and tenor of thy jealousy?
1047	O, no! thy love, though much, is not so great:
1048	It is my love that keeps mine eye awake;
1049	Mine own true love that doth my rest defeat,
1050	To play the watchman ever for thy sake:
1051	For thee watch I whilst thou dost wake elsewhere,
1052	From me far off, with others all too near.
1053	
1054	LXII.
1055	
1056	Sin of self-love possesseth all mine eye
1057	And all my soul and all my every part;
1058	And for this sin there is no remedy,
1059	It is so grounded inward in my heart.
1060	Methinks no face so gracious is as mine,
1061	No shape so true, no truth of such account;
1062	And for myself mine own worth do define,
1063	As I all other in all worths surmount.
1064	But when my glass shows me myself indeed,
1065	Beated and chopp'd with tann'd antiquity,
1066	Mine own self-love quite contrary I read;
1067	Self so self-loving were iniquity.
1068	'Tis thee, myself, that for myself I praise,
1069	Painting my age with beauty of thy days.
1070	
1071	LXIII.
1072	
1073	Against my love shall be, as I am now,
1074	With Time's injurious hand crush'd and o'er-worn;
1075	When hours have drain'd his blood and fill'd his brow
1076	With lines and wrinkles; when his youthful morn
1077	Hath travell'd on to age's steepy night,
1078	And all those beauties whereof now he's king
1079	Are vanishing or vanish'd out of sight,
1080	Stealing away the treasure of his spring;
1081	For such a time do I now fortify
1082	Against confounding age's cruel knife,
1083	That he shall never cut from memory
1084	My sweet love's beauty, though my lover's life:
1085	His beauty shall in these black lines be seen,
1086	And they shall live, and he in them still green.
1087	
1088	LXIV.
1089	
1090	When I have seen by Time's fell hand defaced
1091	The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
1092	When sometime lofty towers I see down-razed
1093	And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
1094	When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
1095	Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
1096	And the firm soil win of the watery main,
1097	Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
1098	When I have seen such interchange of state,
1099	Or state itself confounded to decay;
1100	Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
1101	That Time will come and take my love away.
1102	This thought is as a death, which cannot choose
1103	But weep to have that which it fears to lose.
1104	
1105	LXV.
1106	
1107	Since brass, nor stone, nor earth, nor boundless sea,
1108	But sad mortality o'er-sways their power,
1109	How with this rage shall beauty hold a plea,
1110	Whose action is no stronger than a flower?
1111	O, how shall summer's honey breath hold out
1112	Against the wreckful siege of battering days,
1113	When rocks impregnable are not so stout,
1114	Nor gates of steel so strong, but Time decays?
1115	O fearful meditation! where, alack,
1116	Shall Time's best jewel from Time's chest lie hid?
1117	Or what strong hand can hold his swift foot back?
1118	Or who his spoil of beauty can forbid?
1119	O, none, unless this miracle have might,
1120	That in black ink my love may still shine bright.
1121	
1122	LXVI.
1123	
1124	Tired with all these, for restful death I cry,
1125	As, to behold desert a beggar born,
1126	And needy nothing trimm'd in jollity,
1127	And purest faith unhappily forsworn,
1128	And guilded honour shamefully misplaced,
1129	And maiden virtue rudely strumpeted,
1130	And right perfection wrongfully disgraced,
1131	And strength by limping sway disabled,
1132	And art made tongue-tied by authority,
1133	And folly doctor-like controlling skill,
1134	And simple truth miscall'd simplicity,
1135	And captive good attending captain ill:
1136	Tired with all these, from these would I be gone,
1137	Save that, to die, I leave my love alone.
1138	
1139	LXVII.
1140	
1141	Ah! wherefore with infection should he live,
1142	And with his presence grace impiety,
1143	That sin by him advantage should achieve
1144	And lace itself with his society?
1145	Why should false painting imitate his cheek
1146	And steal dead seeing of his living hue?
1147	Why should poor beauty indirectly seek
1148	Roses of shadow, since his rose is true?
1149	Why should he live, now Nature bankrupt is,
1150	Beggar'd of blood to blush through lively veins?
1151	For she hath no exchequer now but his,
1152	And, proud of many, lives upon his gains.
1153	O, him she stores, to show what wealth she had
1154	In days long since, before these last so bad.
1155	
1156	LXVIII.
1157	
1158	Thus is his cheek the map of days outworn,
1159	When beauty lived and died as flowers do now,
1160	Before the bastard signs of fair were born,
1161	Or durst inhabit on a living brow;
1162	Before the golden tresses of the dead,
1163	The right of sepulchres, were shorn away,
1164	To live a second life on second head;
1165	Ere beauty's dead fleece made another gay:
1166	In him those holy antique hours are seen,
1167	Without all ornament, itself and true,
1168	Making no summer of another's green,
1169	Robbing no old to dress his beauty new;
1170	And him as for a map doth Nature store,
1171	To show false Art what beauty was of yore.
1172	
1173	LXIX.
1174	
1175	Those parts of thee that the world's eye doth view
1176	Want nothing that the thought of hearts can mend;
1177	All tongues, the voice of souls, give thee that due,
1178	Uttering bare truth, even so as foes commend.
1179	Thy outward thus with outward praise is crown'd;
1180	But those same tongues that give thee so thine own
1181	In other accents do this praise confound
1182	By seeing farther than the eye hath shown.
1183	They look into the beauty of thy mind,
1184	And that, in guess, they measure by thy deeds;
1185	Then, churls, their thoughts, although their eyes were kind,
1186	To thy fair flower add the rank smell of weeds:
1187	But why thy odour matcheth not thy show,
1188	The solve is this, that thou dost common grow.
1189	
1190	LXX.
1191	
1192	That thou art blamed shall not be thy defect,
1193	For slander's mark was ever yet the fair;
1194	The ornament of beauty is suspect,
1195	A crow that flies in heaven's sweetest air.
1196	So thou be good, slander doth but approve
1197	Thy worth the greater, being woo'd of time;
1198	For canker vice the sweetest buds doth love,
1199	And thou present'st a pure unstained prime.
1200	Thou hast pass'd by the ambush of young days,
1201	Either not assail'd or victor being charged;
1202	Yet this thy praise cannot be so thy praise,
1203	To tie up envy evermore enlarged:
1204	If some suspect of ill mask'd not thy show,
1205	Then thou alone kingdoms of hearts shouldst owe.
1206	
1207	LXXI.
1208	
1209	No longer mourn for me when I am dead
1210	Then you shall hear the surly sullen bell
1211	Give warning to the world that I am fled
1212	From this vile world, with vilest worms to dwell:
1213	Nay, if you read this line, remember not
1214	The hand that writ it; for I love you so
1215	That I in your sweet thoughts would be forgot
1216	If thinking on me then should make you woe.
1217	O, if, I say, you look upon this verse
1218	When I perhaps compounded am with clay,
1219	Do not so much as my poor name rehearse.
1220	But let your love even with my life decay,
1221	Lest the wise world should look into your moan
1222	And mock you with me after I am gone.
1223	
1224	LXXII.
1225	
1226	O, lest the world should task you to recite
1227	What merit lived in me, that you should love
1228	After my death, dear love, forget me quite,
1229	For you in me can nothing worthy prove;
1230	Unless you would devise some virtuous lie,
1231	To do more for me than mine own desert,
1232	And hang more praise upon deceased I
1233	Than niggard truth would willingly impart:
1234	O, lest your true love may seem false in this,
1235	That you for love speak well of me untrue,
1236	My name be buried where my body is,
1237	And live no more to shame nor me nor you.
1238	For I am shamed by that which I bring forth,
1239	And so should you, to love things nothing worth.
1240	
1241	LXXIII.
1242	
1243	That time of year thou mayst in me behold
1244	When yellow leaves, or none, or few, do hang
1245	Upon those boughs which shake against the cold,
1246	Bare ruin'd choirs, where late the sweet birds sang.
1247	In me thou seest the twilight of such day
1248	As after sunset fadeth in the west,
1249	Which by and by black night doth take away,
1250	Death's second self, that seals up all in rest.
1251	In me thou see'st the glowing of such fire
1252	That on the ashes of his youth doth lie,
1253	As the death-bed whereon it must expire
1254	Consumed with that which it was nourish'd by.
1255	This thou perceivest, which makes thy love more strong,
1256	To love that well which thou must leave ere long.
1257	
1258	LXXIV.
1259	
1260	But be contented: when that fell arrest
1261	Without all bail shall carry me away,
1262	My life hath in this line some interest,
1263	Which for memorial still with thee shall stay.
1264	When thou reviewest this, thou dost review
1265	The very part was consecrate to thee:
1266	The earth can have but earth, which is his due;
1267	My spirit is thine, the better part of me:
1268	So then thou hast but lost the dregs of life,
1269	The prey of worms, my body being dead,
1270	The coward conquest of a wretch's knife,
1271	Too base of thee to be remembered.
1272	The worth of that is that which it contains,
1273	And that is this, and this with thee remains.
1274	
1275	LXXV.
1276	
1277	So are you to my thoughts as food to life,
1278	Or as sweet-season'd showers are to the ground;
1279	And for the peace of you I hold such strife
1280	As 'twixt a miser and his wealth is found;
1281	Now proud as an enjoyer and anon
1282	Doubting the filching age will steal his treasure,
1283	Now counting best to be with you alone,
1284	Then better'd that the world may see my pleasure;
1285	Sometime all full with feasting on your sight
1286	And by and by clean starved for a look;
1287	Possessing or pursuing no delight,
1288	Save what is had or must from you be took.
1289	Thus do I pine and surfeit day by day,
1290	Or gluttoning on all, or all away.
1291	
1292	LXXVI.
1293	
1294	Why is my verse so barren of new pride,
1295	So far from variation or quick change?
1296	Why with the time do I not glance aside
1297	To new-found methods and to compounds strange?
1298	Why write I still all one, ever the same,
1299	And keep invention in a noted weed,
1300	That every word doth almost tell my name,
1301	Showing their birth and where they did proceed?
1302	O, know, sweet love, I always write of you,
1303	And you and love are still my argument;
1304	So all my best is dressing old words new,
1305	Spending again what is already spent:
1306	For as the sun is daily new and old,
1307	So is my love still telling what is told.
1308	
1309	LXXVII.
1310	
1311	Thy glass will show thee how thy beauties wear,
1312	Thy dial how thy precious minutes waste;
1313	The vacant leaves thy mind's imprint will bear,
1314	And of this book this learning mayst thou taste.
1315	The wrinkles which thy glass will truly show
1316	Of mouthed graves will give thee memory;
1317	Thou by thy dial's shady stealth mayst know
1318	Time's thievish progress to eternity.
1319	Look, what thy memory can not contain
1320	Commit to these waste blanks, and thou shalt find
1321	Those children nursed, deliver'd from thy brain,
1322	To take a new acquaintance of thy mind.
1323	These offices, so oft as thou wilt look,
1324	Shall profit thee and much enrich thy book.
1325	
1326	LXXVIII.
1327	
1328	So oft have I invoked thee for my Muse
1329	And found such fair assistance in my verse
1330	As every alien pen hath got my use
1331	And under thee their poesy disperse.
1332	Thine eyes that taught the dumb on high to sing
1333	And heavy ignorance aloft to fly
1334	Have added feathers to the learned's wing
1335	And given grace a double majesty.
1336	Yet be most proud of that which I compile,
1337	Whose influence is thine and born of thee:
1338	In others' works thou dost but mend the style,
1339	And arts with thy sweet graces graced be;
1340	But thou art all my art and dost advance
1341	As high as learning my rude ignorance.
1342	
1343	LXXIX.
1344	
1345	Whilst I alone did call upon thy aid,
1346	My verse alone had all thy gentle grace,
1347	But now my gracious numbers are decay'd
1348	And my sick Muse doth give another place.
1349	I grant, sweet love, thy lovely argument
1350	Deserves the travail of a worthier pen,
1351	Yet what of thee thy poet doth invent
1352	He robs thee of and pays it thee again.
1353	He lends thee virtue and he stole that word
1354	From thy behavior; beauty doth he give
1355	And found it in thy cheek; he can afford
1356	No praise to thee but what in thee doth live.
1357	Then thank him not for that which he doth say,
1358	Since what he owes thee thou thyself dost pay.
1359	
1360	LXXX.
1361	
1362	O, how I faint when I of you do write,
1363	Knowing a better spirit doth use your name,
1364	And in the praise thereof spends all his might,
1365	To make me tongue-tied, speaking of your fame!
1366	But since your worth, wide as the ocean is,
1367	The humble as the proudest sail doth bear,
1368	My saucy bark inferior far to his
1369	On your broad main doth wilfully appear.
1370	Your shallowest help will hold me up afloat,
1371	Whilst he upon your soundless deep doth ride;
1372	Or being wreck'd, I am a worthless boat,
1373	He of tall building and of goodly pride:
1374	Then if he thrive and I be cast away,
1375	The worst was this; my love was my decay.
1376	
1377	LXXXI.
1378	
1379	Or I shall live your epitaph to make,
1380	Or you survive when I in earth am rotten;
1381	From hence your memory death cannot take,
1382	Although in me each part will be forgotten.
1383	Your name from hence immortal life shall have,
1384	Though I, once gone, to all the world must die:
1385	The earth can yield me but a common grave,
1386	When you entombed in men's eyes shall lie.
1387	Your monument shall be my gentle verse,
1388	Which eyes not yet created shall o'er-read,
1389	And tongues to be your being shall rehearse
1390	When all the breathers of this world are dead;
1391	You still shall live--such virtue hath my pen--
1392	Where breath most breathes, even in the mouths of men.
1393	
1394	LXXXII.
1395	
1396	I grant thou wert not married to my Muse
1397	And therefore mayst without attaint o'erlook
1398	The dedicated words which writers use
1399	Of their fair subject, blessing every book
1400	Thou art as fair in knowledge as in hue,
1401	Finding thy worth a limit past my praise,
1402	And therefore art enforced to seek anew
1403	Some fresher stamp of the time-bettering days
1404	And do so, love; yet when they have devised
1405	What strained touches rhetoric can lend,
1406	Thou truly fair wert truly sympathized
1407	In true plain words by thy true-telling friend;
1408	And their gross painting might be better used
1409	Where cheeks need blood; in thee it is abused.
1410	
1411	LXXXIII.
1412	
1413	I never saw that you did painting need
1414	And therefore to your fair no painting set;
1415	I found, or thought I found, you did exceed
1416	The barren tender of a poet's debt;
1417	And therefore have I slept in your report,
1418	That you yourself being extant well might show
1419	How far a modern quill doth come too short,
1420	Speaking of worth, what worth in you doth grow.
1421	This silence for my sin you did impute,
1422	Which shall be most my glory, being dumb;
1423	For I impair not beauty being mute,
1424	When others would give life and bring a tomb.
1425	There lives more life in one of your fair eyes
1426	Than both your poets can in praise devise.
1427	
1428	LXXXIV.
1429	
1430	Who is it that says most? which can say more
1431	Than this rich praise, that you alone are you?
1432	In whose confine immured is the store
1433	Which should example where your equal grew.
1434	Lean penury within that pen doth dwell
1435	That to his subject lends not some small glory;
1436	But he that writes of you, if he can tell
1437	That you are you, so dignifies his story,
1438	Let him but copy what in you is writ,
1439	Not making worse what nature made so clear,
1440	And such a counterpart shall fame his wit,
1441	Making his style admired every where.
1442	You to your beauteous blessings add a curse,
1443	Being fond on praise, which makes your praises worse.
1444	
1445	LXXXV.
1446	
1447	My tongue-tied Muse in manners holds her still,
1448	While comments of your praise, richly compiled,
1449	Reserve their character with golden quill
1450	And precious phrase by all the Muses filed.
1451	I think good thoughts whilst other write good words,
1452	And like unletter'd clerk still cry 'Amen'
1453	To every hymn that able spirit affords
1454	In polish'd form of well-refined pen.
1455	Hearing you praised, I say ''Tis so, 'tis true,'
1456	And to the most of praise add something more;
1457	But that is in my thought, whose love to you,
1458	Though words come hindmost, holds his rank before.
1459	Then others for the breath of words respect,
1460	Me for my dumb thoughts, speaking in effect.
1461	
1462	LXXXVI.
1463	
1464	Was it the proud full sail of his great verse,
1465	Bound for the prize of all too precious you,
1466	That did my ripe thoughts in my brain inhearse,
1467	Making their tomb the womb wherein they grew?
1468	Was it his spirit, by spirits taught to write
1469	Above a mortal pitch, that struck me dead?
1470	No, neither he, nor his compeers by night
1471	Giving him aid, my verse astonished.
1472	He, nor that affable familiar ghost
1473	Which nightly gulls him with intelligence
1474	As victors of my silence cannot boast;
1475	I was not sick of any fear from thence:
1476	But when your countenance fill'd up his line,
1477	Then lack'd I matter; that enfeebled mine.
1478	
1479	LXXXVII.
1480	
1481	Farewell! thou art too dear for my possessing,
1482	And like enough thou know'st thy estimate:
1483	The charter of thy worth gives thee releasing;
1484	My bonds in thee are all determinate.
1485	For how do I hold thee but by thy granting?
1486	And for that riches where is my deserving?
1487	The cause of this fair gift in me is wanting,
1488	And so my patent back again is swerving.
1489	Thyself thou gavest, thy own worth then not knowing,
1490	Or me, to whom thou gavest it, else mistaking;
1491	So thy great gift, upon misprision growing,
1492	Comes home again, on better judgment making.
1493	Thus have I had thee, as a dream doth flatter,
1494	In sleep a king, but waking no such matter.
1495	
1496	LXXXVIII.
1497	
1498	When thou shalt be disposed to set me light,
1499	And place my merit in the eye of scorn,
1500	Upon thy side against myself I'll fight,
1501	And prove thee virtuous, though thou art forsworn.
1502	With mine own weakness being best acquainted,
1503	Upon thy part I can set down a story
1504	Of faults conceal'd, wherein I am attainted,
1505	That thou in losing me shalt win much glory:
1506	And I by this will be a gainer too;
1507	For bending all my loving thoughts on thee,
1508	The injuries that to myself I do,
1509	Doing thee vantage, double-vantage me.
1510	Such is my love, to thee I so belong,
1511	That for thy right myself will bear all wrong.
1512	
1513	LXXXIX.
1514	
1515	Say that thou didst forsake me for some fault,
1516	And I will comment upon that offence;
1517	Speak of my lameness, and I straight will halt,
1518	Against thy reasons making no defence.
1519	Thou canst not, love, disgrace me half so ill,
1520	To set a form upon desired change,
1521	As I'll myself disgrace: knowing thy will,
1522	I will acquaintance strangle and look strange,
1523	Be absent from thy walks, and in my tongue
1524	Thy sweet beloved name no more shall dwell,
1525	Lest I, too much profane, should do it wrong
1526	And haply of our old acquaintance tell.
1527	For thee against myself I'll vow debate,
1528	For I must ne'er love him whom thou dost hate.
1529	
1530	XC.
1531	
1532	Then hate me when thou wilt; if ever, now;
1533	Now, while the world is bent my deeds to cross,
1534	Join with the spite of fortune, make me bow,
1535	And do not drop in for an after-loss:
1536	Ah, do not, when my heart hath 'scoped this sorrow,
1537	Come in the rearward of a conquer'd woe;
1538	Give not a windy night a rainy morrow,
1539	To linger out a purposed overthrow.
1540	If thou wilt leave me, do not leave me last,
1541	When other petty griefs have done their spite
1542	But in the onset come; so shall I taste
1543	At first the very worst of fortune's might,
1544	And other strains of woe, which now seem woe,
1545	Compared with loss of thee will not seem so.
1546	
1547	XCI.
1548	
1549	Some glory in their birth, some in their skill,
1550	Some in their wealth, some in their bodies' force,
1551	Some in their garments, though new-fangled ill,
1552	Some in their hawks and hounds, some in their horse;
1553	And every humour hath his adjunct pleasure,
1554	Wherein it finds a joy above the rest:
1555	But these particulars are not my measure;
1556	All these I better in one general best.
1557	Thy love is better than high birth to me,
1558	Richer than wealth, prouder than garments' cost,
1559	Of more delight than hawks or horses be;
1560	And having thee, of all men's pride I boast:
1561	Wretched in this alone, that thou mayst take
1562	All this away and me most wretched make.
1563	
1564	XCII.
1565	
1566	But do thy worst to steal thyself away,
1567	For term of life thou art assured mine,
1568	And life no longer than thy love will stay,
1569	For it depends upon that love of thine.
1570	Then need I not to fear the worst of wrongs,
1571	When in the least of them my life hath end.
1572	I see a better state to me belongs
1573	Than that which on thy humour doth depend;
1574	Thou canst not vex me with inconstant mind,
1575	Since that my life on thy revolt doth lie.
1576	O, what a happy title do I find,
1577	Happy to have thy love, happy to die!
1578	But what's so blessed-fair that fears no blot?
1579	Thou mayst be false, and yet I know it not.
1580	
1581	XCIII.
1582	
1583	So shall I live, supposing thou art true,
1584	Like a deceived husband; so love's face
1585	May still seem love to me, though alter'd new;
1586	Thy looks with me, thy heart in other place:
1587	For there can live no hatred in thine eye,
1588	Therefore in that I cannot know thy change.
1589	In many's looks the false heart's history
1590	Is writ in moods and frowns and wrinkles strange,
1591	But heaven in thy creation did decree
1592	That in thy face sweet love should ever dwell;
1593	Whate'er thy thoughts or thy heart's workings be,
1594	Thy looks should nothing thence but sweetness tell.
1595	How like Eve's apple doth thy beauty grow,
1596	if thy sweet virtue answer not thy show!
1597	
1598	XCIV.
1599	
1600	They that have power to hurt and will do none,
1601	That do not do the thing they most do show,
1602	Who, moving others, are themselves as stone,
1603	Unmoved, cold, and to temptation slow,
1604	They rightly do inherit heaven's graces
1605	And husband nature's riches from expense;
1606	They are the lords and owners of their faces,
1607	Others but stewards of their excellence.
1608	The summer's flower is to the summer sweet,
1609	Though to itself it only live and die,
1610	But if that flower with base infection meet,
1611	The basest weed outbraves his dignity:
1612	For sweetest things turn sourest by their deeds;
1613	Lilies that fester smell far worse than weeds.
1614	
1615	XCV.
1616	
1617	How sweet and lovely dost thou make the shame
1618	Which, like a canker in the fragrant rose,
1619	Doth spot the beauty of thy budding name!
1620	O, in what sweets dost thou thy sins enclose!
1621	That tongue that tells the story of thy days,
1622	Making lascivious comments on thy sport,
1623	Cannot dispraise but in a kind of praise;
1624	Naming thy name blesses an ill report.
1625	O, what a mansion have those vices got
1626	Which for their habitation chose out thee,
1627	Where beauty's veil doth cover every blot,
1628	And all things turn to fair that eyes can see!
1629	Take heed, dear heart, of this large privilege;
1630	The hardest knife ill-used doth lose his edge.
1631	
1632	XCVI.
1633	
1634	Some say thy fault is youth, some wantonness;
1635	Some say thy grace is youth and gentle sport;
1636	Both grace and faults are loved of more and less;
1637	Thou makest faults graces that to thee resort.
1638	As on the finger of a throned queen
1639	The basest jewel will be well esteem'd,
1640	So are those errors that in thee are seen
1641	To truths translated and for true things deem'd.
1642	How many lambs might the stem wolf betray,
1643	If like a lamb he could his looks translate!
1644	How many gazers mightst thou lead away,
1645	If thou wouldst use the strength of all thy state!
1646	But do not so; I love thee in such sort
1647	As, thou being mine, mine is thy good report.
1648	
1649	XCVII.
1650	
1651	How like a winter hath my absence been
1652	From thee, the pleasure of the fleeting year!
1653	What freezings have I felt, what dark days seen!
1654	What old December's bareness every where!
1655	And yet this time removed was summer's time,
1656	The teeming autumn, big with rich increase,
1657	Bearing the wanton burden of the prime,
1658	Like widow'd wombs after their lords' decease:
1659	Yet this abundant issue seem'd to me
1660	But hope of orphans and unfather'd fruit;
1661	For summer and his pleasures wait on thee,
1662	And, thou away, the very birds are mute;
1663	Or, if they sing, 'tis with so dull a cheer
1664	That leaves look pale, dreading the winter's near.
1665	
1666	XCVIII.
1667	
1668	From you have I been absent in the spring,
1669	When proud-pied April dress'd in all his trim
1670	Hath put a spirit of youth in every thing,
1671	That heavy Saturn laugh'd and leap'd with him.
1672	Yet nor the lays of birds nor the sweet smell
1673	Of different flowers in odour and in hue
1674	Could make me any summer's story tell,
1675	Or from their proud lap pluck them where they grew;
1676	Nor did I wonder at the lily's white,
1677	Nor praise the deep vermilion in the rose;
1678	They were but sweet, but figures of delight,
1679	Drawn after you, you pattern of all those.
1680	Yet seem'd it winter still, and, you away,
1681	As with your shadow I with these did play:
1682	
1683	XCIX.
1684	
1685	The forward violet thus did I chide:
1686	Sweet thief, whence didst thou steal thy sweet that smells,
1687	If not from my love's breath? The purple pride
1688	Which on thy soft cheek for complexion dwells
1689	In my love's veins thou hast too grossly dyed.
1690	The lily I condemned for thy hand,
1691	And buds of marjoram had stol'n thy hair:
1692	The roses fearfully on thorns did stand,
1693	One blushing shame, another white despair;
1694	A third, nor red nor white, had stol'n of both
1695	And to his robbery had annex'd thy breath;
1696	But, for his theft, in pride of all his growth
1697	A vengeful canker eat him up to death.
1698	More flowers I noted, yet I none could see
1699	But sweet or colour it had stol'n from thee.
1700	
1701	C.
1702	
1703	Where art thou, Muse, that thou forget'st so long
1704	To speak of that which gives thee all thy might?
1705	Spend'st thou thy fury on some worthless song,
1706	Darkening thy power to lend base subjects light?
1707	Return, forgetful Muse, and straight redeem
1708	In gentle numbers time so idly spent;
1709	Sing to the ear that doth thy lays esteem
1710	And gives thy pen both skill and argument.
1711	Rise, resty Muse, my love's sweet face survey,
1712	If Time have any wrinkle graven there;
1713	If any, be a satire to decay,
1714	And make Time's spoils despised every where.
1715	Give my love fame faster than Time wastes life;
1716	So thou prevent'st his scythe and crooked knife.
1717	
1718	CI.
1719	
1720	O truant Muse, what shall be thy amends
1721	For thy neglect of truth in beauty dyed?
1722	Both truth and beauty on my love depends;
1723	So dost thou too, and therein dignified.
1724	Make answer, Muse: wilt thou not haply say
1725	'Truth needs no colour, with his colour fix'd;
1726	Beauty no pencil, beauty's truth to lay;
1727	But best is best, if never intermix'd?'
1728	Because he needs no praise, wilt thou be dumb?
1729	Excuse not silence so; for't lies in thee
1730	To make him much outlive a gilded tomb,
1731	And to be praised of ages yet to be.
1732	Then do thy office, Muse; I teach thee how
1733	To make him seem long hence as he shows now.
1734	
1735	CII.
1736	
1737	My love is strengthen'd, though more weak in seeming;
1738	I love not less, though less the show appear:
1739	That love is merchandized whose rich esteeming
1740	The owner's tongue doth publish every where.
1741	Our love was new and then but in the spring
1742	When I was wont to greet it with my lays,
1743	As Philomel in summer's front doth sing
1744	And stops her pipe in growth of riper days:
1745	Not that the summer is less pleasant now
1746	Than when her mournful hymns did hush the night,
1747	But that wild music burthens every bough
1748	And sweets grown common lose their dear delight.
1749	Therefore like her I sometime hold my tongue,
1750	Because I would not dull you with my song.
1751	
1752	CIII.
1753	
1754	Alack, what poverty my Muse brings forth,
1755	That having such a scope to show her pride,
1756	The argument all bare is of more worth
1757	Than when it hath my added praise beside!
1758	O, blame me not, if I no more can write!
1759	Look in your glass, and there appears a face
1760	That over-goes my blunt invention quite,
1761	Dulling my lines and doing me disgrace.
1762	Were it not sinful then, striving to mend,
1763	To mar the subject that before was well?
1764	For to no other pass my verses tend
1765	Than of your graces and your gifts to tell;
1766	And more, much more, than in my verse can sit
1767	Your own glass shows you when you look in it.
1768	
1769	CIV.
1770	
1771	To me, fair friend, you never can be old,
1772	For as you were when first your eye I eyed,
1773	Such seems your beauty still. Three winters cold
1774	Have from the forests shook three summers' pride,
1775	Three beauteous springs to yellow autumn turn'd
1776	In process of the seasons have I seen,
1777	Three April perfumes in three hot Junes burn'd,
1778	Since first I saw you fresh, which yet are green.
1779	Ah! yet doth beauty, like a dial-hand,
1780	Steal from his figure and no pace perceived;
1781	So your sweet hue, which methinks still doth stand,
1782	Hath motion and mine eye may be deceived:
1783	For fear of which, hear this, thou age unbred;
1784	Ere you were born was beauty's summer dead.
1785	
1786	CV.
1787	
1788	Let not my love be call'd idolatry,
1789	Nor my beloved as an idol show,
1790	Since all alike my songs and praises be
1791	To one, of one, still such, and ever so.
1792	Kind is my love to-day, to-morrow kind,
1793	Still constant in a wondrous excellence;
1794	Therefore my verse to constancy confined,
1795	One thing expressing, leaves out difference.
1796	'Fair, kind and true' is all my argument,
1797	'Fair, kind, and true' varying to other words;
1798	And in this change is my invention spent,
1799	Three themes in one, which wondrous scope affords.
1800	'Fair, kind, and true,' have often lived alone,
1801	Which three till now never kept seat in one.
1802	
1803	CVI.
1804	
1805	When in the chronicle of wasted time
1806	I see descriptions of the fairest wights,
1807	And beauty making beautiful old rhyme
1808	In praise of ladies dead and lovely knights,
1809	Then, in the blazon of sweet beauty's best,
1810	Of hand, of foot, of lip, of eye, of brow,
1811	I see their antique pen would have express'd
1812	Even such a beauty as you master now.
1813	So all their praises are but prophecies
1814	Of this our time, all you prefiguring;
1815	And, for they look'd but with divining eyes,
1816	They had not skill enough your worth to sing:
1817	For we, which now behold these present days,
1818	Had eyes to wonder, but lack tongues to praise.
1819	
1820	CVII.
1821	
1822	Not mine own fears, nor the prophetic soul
1823	Of the wide world dreaming on things to come,
1824	Can yet the lease of my true love control,
1825	Supposed as forfeit to a confined doom.
1826	The mortal moon hath her eclipse endured
1827	And the sad augurs mock their own presage;
1828	Incertainties now crown themselves assured
1829	And peace proclaims olives of endless age.
1830	Now with the drops of this most balmy time
1831	My love looks fresh, and death to me subscribes,
1832	Since, spite of him, I'll live in this poor rhyme,
1833	While he insults o'er dull and speechless tribes:
1834	And thou in this shalt find thy monument,
1835	When tyrants' crests and tombs of brass are spent.
1836	
1837	CVIII.
1838	
1839	What's in the brain that ink may character
1840	Which hath not figured to thee my true spirit?
1841	What's new to speak, what new to register,
1842	That may express my love or thy dear merit?
1843	Nothing, sweet boy; but yet, like prayers divine,
1844	I must, each day say o'er the very same,
1845	Counting no old thing old, thou mine, I thine,
1846	Even as when first I hallow'd thy fair name.
1847	So that eternal love in love's fresh case
1848	Weighs not the dust and injury of age,
1849	Nor gives to necessary wrinkles place,
1850	But makes antiquity for aye his page,
1851	Finding the first conceit of love there bred
1852	Where time and outward form would show it dead.
1853	
1854	CIX.
1855	
1856	O, never say that I was false of heart,
1857	Though absence seem'd my flame to qualify.
1858	As easy might I from myself depart
1859	As from my soul, which in thy breast doth lie:
1860	That is my home of love: if I have ranged,
1861	Like him that travels I return again,
1862	Just to the time, not with the time exchanged,
1863	So that myself bring water for my stain.
1864	Never believe, though in my nature reign'd
1865	All frailties that besiege all kinds of blood,
1866	That it could so preposterously be stain'd,
1867	To leave for nothing all thy sum of good;
1868	For nothing this wide universe I call,
1869	Save thou, my rose; in it thou art my all.
1870	
1871	CX.
1872	
1873	Alas, 'tis true I have gone here and there
1874	And made myself a motley to the view,
1875	Gored mine own thoughts, sold cheap what is most dear,
1876	Made old offences of affections new;
1877	Most true it is that I have look'd on truth
1878	Askance and strangely: but, by all above,
1879	These blenches gave my heart another youth,
1880	And worse essays proved thee my best of love.
1881	Now all is done, have what shall have no end:
1882	Mine appetite I never more will grind
1883	On newer proof, to try an older friend,
1884	A god in love, to whom I am confined.
1885	Then give me welcome, next my heaven the best,
1886	Even to thy pure and most most loving breast.
1887	
1888	CXI.
1889	
1890	O, for my sake do you with Fortune chide,
1891	The guilty goddess of my harmful deeds,
1892	That did not better for my life provide
1893	Than public means which public manners breeds.
1894	Thence comes it that my name receives a brand,
1895	And almost thence my nature is subdued
1896	To what it works in, like the dyer's hand:
1897	Pity me then and wish I were renew'd;
1898	Whilst, like a willing patient, I will drink
1899	Potions of eisel 'gainst my strong infection
1900	No bitterness that I will bitter think,
1901	Nor double penance, to correct correction.
1902	Pity me then, dear friend, and I assure ye
1903	Even that your pity is enough to cure me.
1904	
1905	CXII.
1906	
1907	Your love and pity doth the impression fill
1908	Which vulgar scandal stamp'd upon my brow;
1909	For what care I who calls me well or ill,
1910	So you o'er-green my bad, my good allow?
1911	You are my all the world, and I must strive
1912	To know my shames and praises from your tongue:
1913	None else to me, nor I to none alive,
1914	That my steel'd sense or changes right or wrong.
1915	In so profound abysm I throw all care
1916	Of others' voices, that my adder's sense
1917	To critic and to flatterer stopped are.
1918	Mark how with my neglect I do dispense:
1919	You are so strongly in my purpose bred
1920	That all the world besides methinks are dead.
1921	
1922	CXIII.
1923	
1924	Since I left you, mine eye is in my mind;
1925	And that which governs me to go about
1926	Doth part his function and is partly blind,
1927	Seems seeing, but effectually is out;
1928	For it no form delivers to the heart
1929	Of bird of flower, or shape, which it doth latch:
1930	Of his quick objects hath the mind no part,
1931	Nor his own vision holds what it doth catch:
1932	For if it see the rudest or gentlest sight,
1933	The most sweet favour or deformed'st creature,
1934	The mountain or the sea, the day or night,
1935	The crow or dove, it shapes them to your feature:
1936	Incapable of more, replete with you,
1937	My most true mind thus makes mine eye untrue.
1938	
1939	CXIV.
1940	
1941	Or whether doth my mind, being crown'd with you,
1942	Drink up the monarch's plague, this flattery?
1943	Or whether shall I say, mine eye saith true,
1944	And that your love taught it this alchemy,
1945	To make of monsters and things indigest
1946	Such cherubins as your sweet self resemble,
1947	Creating every bad a perfect best,
1948	As fast as objects to his beams assemble?
1949	O,'tis the first; 'tis flattery in my seeing,
1950	And my great mind most kingly drinks it up:
1951	Mine eye well knows what with his gust is 'greeing,
1952	And to his palate doth prepare the cup:
1953	If it be poison'd, 'tis the lesser sin
1954	That mine eye loves it and doth first begin.
1955	
1956	CXV.
1957	
1958	Those lines that I before have writ do lie,
1959	Even those that said I could not love you dearer:
1960	Yet then my judgment knew no reason why
1961	My most full flame should afterwards burn clearer.
1962	But reckoning time, whose million'd accidents
1963	Creep in 'twixt vows and change decrees of kings,
1964	Tan sacred beauty, blunt the sharp'st intents,
1965	Divert strong minds to the course of altering things;
1966	Alas, why, fearing of time's tyranny,
1967	Might I not then say 'Now I love you best,'
1968	When I was certain o'er incertainty,
1969	Crowning the present, doubting of the rest?
1970	Love is a babe; then might I not say so,
1971	To give full growth to that which still doth grow?
1972	
1973	CXVI.
1974	
1975	Let me not to the marriage of true minds
1976	Admit impediments. Love is not love
1977	Which alters when it alteration finds,
1978	Or bends with the remover to remove:
1979	O no! it is an ever-fixed mark
1980	That looks on tempests and is never shaken;
1981	It is the star to every wandering bark,
1982	Whose worth's unknown, although his height be taken.
1983	Love's not Time's fool, though rosy lips and cheeks
1984	Within his bending sickle's compass come:
1985	Love alters not with his brief hours and weeks,
1986	But bears it out even to the edge of doom.
1987	If this be error and upon me proved,
1988	I never writ, nor no man ever loved.
1989	
1990	CXVII.
1991	
1992	Accuse me thus: that I have scanted all
1993	Wherein I should your great deserts repay,
1994	Forgot upon your dearest love to call,
1995	Whereto all bonds do tie me day by day;
1996	That I have frequent been with unknown minds
1997	And given to time your own dear-purchased right
1998	That I have hoisted sail to all the winds
1999	Which should transport me farthest from your sight.
2000	Book both my wilfulness and errors down
2001	And on just proof surmise accumulate;
2002	Bring me within the level of your frown,
2003	But shoot not at me in your waken'd hate;
2004	Since my appeal says I did strive to prove
2005	The constancy and virtue of your love.
2006	
2007	CXVIII.
2008	
2009	Like as, to make our appetites more keen,
2010	With eager compounds we our palate urge,
2011	As, to prevent our maladies unseen,
2012	We sicken to shun sickness when we purge,
2013	Even so, being tuff of your ne'er-cloying sweetness,
2014	To bitter sauces did I frame my feeding
2015	And, sick of welfare, found a kind of meetness
2016	To be diseased ere that there was true needing.
2017	Thus policy in love, to anticipate
2018	The ills that were not, grew to faults assured
2019	And brought to medicine a healthful state
2020	Which, rank of goodness, would by ill be cured:
2021	But thence I learn, and find the lesson true,
2022	Drugs poison him that so fell sick of you.
2023	
2024	CXIX.
2025	
2026	What potions have I drunk of Siren tears,
2027	Distill'd from limbecks foul as hell within,
2028	Applying fears to hopes and hopes to fears,
2029	Still losing when I saw myself to win!
2030	What wretched errors hath my heart committed,
2031	Whilst it hath thought itself so blessed never!
2032	How have mine eyes out of their spheres been fitted
2033	In the distraction of this madding fever!
2034	O benefit of ill! now I find true
2035	That better is by evil still made better;
2036	And ruin'd love, when it is built anew,
2037	Grows fairer than at first, more strong, far greater.
2038	So I return rebuked to my content
2039	And gain by ill thrice more than I have spent.
2040	
2041	CXX.
2042	
2043	That you were once unkind befriends me now,
2044	And for that sorrow which I then did feel
2045	Needs must I under my transgression bow,
2046	Unless my nerves were brass or hammer'd steel.
2047	For if you were by my unkindness shaken
2048	As I by yours, you've pass'd a hell of time,
2049	And I, a tyrant, have no leisure taken
2050	To weigh how once I suffered in your crime.
2051	O, that our night of woe might have remember'd
2052	My deepest sense, how hard true sorrow hits,
2053	And soon to you, as you to me, then tender'd
2054	The humble slave which wounded bosoms fits!
2055	But that your trespass now becomes a fee;
2056	Mine ransoms yours, and yours must ransom me.
2057	
2058	CXXI.
2059	
2060	'Tis better to be vile than vile esteem'd,
2061	When not to be receives reproach of being,
2062	And the just pleasure lost which is so deem'd
2063	Not by our feeling but by others' seeing:
2064	For why should others false adulterate eyes
2065	Give salutation to my sportive blood?
2066	Or on my frailties why are frailer spies,
2067	Which in their wills count bad what I think good?
2068	No, I am that I am, and they that level
2069	At my abuses reckon up their own:
2070	I may be straight, though they themselves be bevel;
2071	By their rank thoughts my deeds must not be shown;
2072	Unless this general evil they maintain,
2073	All men are bad, and in their badness reign.
2074	
2075	CXXII.
2076	
2077	Thy gift, thy tables, are within my brain
2078	Full character'd with lasting memory,
2079	Which shall above that idle rank remain
2080	Beyond all date, even to eternity;
2081	Or at the least, so long as brain and heart
2082	Have faculty by nature to subsist;
2083	Till each to razed oblivion yield his part
2084	Of thee, thy record never can be miss'd.
2085	That poor retention could not so much hold,
2086	Nor need I tallies thy dear love to score;
2087	Therefore to give them from me was I bold,
2088	To trust those tables that receive thee more:
2089	To keep an adjunct to remember thee
2090	Were to import forgetfulness in me.
2091	
2092	CXXIII.
2093	
2094	No, Time, thou shalt not boast that I do change:
2095	Thy pyramids built up with newer might
2096	To me are nothing novel, nothing strange;
2097	They are but dressings of a former sight.
2098	Our dates are brief, and therefore we admire
2099	What thou dost foist upon us that is old,
2100	And rather make them born to our desire
2101	Than think that we before have heard them told.
2102	Thy registers and thee I both defy,
2103	Not wondering at the present nor the past,
2104	For thy records and what we see doth lie,
2105	Made more or less by thy continual haste.
2106	This I do vow and this shall ever be;
2107	I will be true, despite thy scythe and thee.
2108	
2109	CXXIV.
2110	
2111	If my dear love were but the child of state,
2112	It might for Fortune's bastard be unfather'd'
2113	As subject to Time's love or to Time's hate,
2114	Weeds among weeds, or flowers with flowers gather'd.
2115	No, it was builded far from accident;
2116	It suffers not in smiling pomp, nor falls
2117	Under the blow of thralled discontent,
2118	Whereto the inviting time our fashion calls:
2119	It fears not policy, that heretic,
2120	Which works on leases of short-number'd hours,
2121	But all alone stands hugely politic,
2122	That it nor grows with heat nor drowns with showers.
2123	To this I witness call the fools of time,
2124	Which die for goodness, who have lived for crime.
2125	
2126	CXXV.
2127	
2128	Were 't aught to me I bore the canopy,
2129	With my extern the outward honouring,
2130	Or laid great bases for eternity,
2131	Which prove more short than waste or ruining?
2132	Have I not seen dwellers on form and favour
2133	Lose all, and more, by paying too much rent,
2134	For compound sweet forgoing simple savour,
2135	Pitiful thrivers, in their gazing spent?
2136	No, let me be obsequious in thy heart,
2137	And take thou my oblation, poor but free,
2138	Which is not mix'd with seconds, knows no art,
2139	But mutual render, only me for thee.
2140	Hence, thou suborn'd informer! a true soul
2141	When most impeach'd stands least in thy control.
2142	
2143	CXXVI.
2144	
2145	O thou, my lovely boy, who in thy power
2146	Dost hold Time's fickle glass, his sickle, hour;
2147	Who hast by waning grown, and therein show'st
2148	Thy lovers withering as thy sweet self grow'st;
2149	If Nature, sovereign mistress over wrack,
2150	As thou goest onwards, still will pluck thee back,
2151	She keeps thee to this purpose, that her skill
2152	May time disgrace and wretched minutes kill.
2153	Yet fear her, O thou minion of her pleasure!
2154	She may detain, but not still keep, her treasure:
2155	Her audit, though delay'd, answer'd must be,
2156	And her quietus is to render thee.
2157	
2158	CXXVII.
2159	
2160	In the old age black was not counted fair,
2161	Or if it were, it bore not beauty's name;
2162	But now is black beauty's successive heir,
2163	And beauty slander'd with a bastard shame:
2164	For since each hand hath put on nature's power,
2165	Fairing the foul with art's false borrow'd face,
2166	Sweet beauty hath no name, no holy bower,
2167	But is profaned, if not lives in disgrace.
2168	Therefore my mistress' brows are raven black,
2169	Her eyes so suited, and they mourners seem
2170	At such who, not born fair, no beauty lack,
2171	Slandering creation with a false esteem:
2172	Yet so they mourn, becoming of their woe,
2173	That every tongue says beauty should look so.
2174	
2175	CXXVIII.
2176	
2177	How oft, when thou, my music, music play'st,
2178	Upon that blessed wood whose motion sounds
2179	With thy sweet fingers, when thou gently sway'st
2180	The wiry concord that mine ear confounds,
2181	Do I envy those jacks that nimble leap
2182	To kiss the tender inward of thy hand,
2183	Whilst my poor lips, which should that harvest reap,
2184	At the wood's boldness by thee blushing stand!
2185	To be so tickled, they would change their state
2186	And situation with those dancing chips,
2187	O'er whom thy fingers walk with gentle gait,
2188	Making dead wood more blest than living lips.
2189	Since saucy jacks so happy are in this,
2190	Give them thy fingers, me thy lips to kiss.
2191	
2192	CXXIX.
2193	
2194	The expense of spirit in a waste of shame
2195	Is lust in action; and till action, lust
2196	Is perjured, murderous, bloody, full of blame,
2197	Savage, extreme, rude, cruel, not to trust,
2198	Enjoy'd no sooner but despised straight,
2199	Past reason hunted, and no sooner had
2200	Past reason hated, as a swallow'd bait
2201	On purpose laid to make the taker mad;
2202	Mad in pursuit and in possession so;
2203	Had, having, and in quest to have, extreme;
2204	A bliss in proof, and proved, a very woe;
2205	Before, a joy proposed; behind, a dream.
2206	All this the world well knows; yet none knows well
2207	To shun the heaven that leads men to this hell.
2208	
2209	CXXX.
2210	
2211	My mistress' eyes are nothing like the sun;
2212	Coral is far more red than her lips' red;
2213	If snow be white, why then her breasts are dun;
2214	If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.
2215	I have seen roses damask'd, red and white,
2216	But no such roses see I in her cheeks;
2217	And in some perfumes is there more delight
2218	Than in the breath that from my mistress reeks.
2219	I love to hear her speak, yet well I know
2220	That music hath a far more pleasing sound;
2221	I grant I never saw a goddess go;
2222	My mistress, when she walks, treads on the ground:
2223	And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare
2224	As any she belied with false compare.
2225	
2226	CXXXI.
2227	
2228	Thou art as tyrannous, so as thou art,
2229	As those whose beauties proudly make them cruel;
2230	For well thou know'st to my dear doting heart
2231	Thou art the fairest and most precious jewel.
2232	Yet, in good faith, some say that thee behold
2233	Thy face hath not the power to make love groan:
2234	To say they err I dare not be so bold,
2235	Although I swear it to myself alone.
2236	And, to be sure that is not false I swear,
2237	A thousand groans, but thinking on thy face,
2238	One on another's neck, do witness bear
2239	Thy black is fairest in my judgment's place.
2240	In nothing art thou black save in thy deeds,
2241	And thence this slander, as I think, proceeds.
2242	
2243	CXXXII.
2244	
2245	Thine eyes I love, and they, as pitying me,
2246	Knowing thy heart torments me with disdain,
2247	Have put on black and loving mourners be,
2248	Looking with pretty ruth upon my pain.
2249	And truly not the morning sun of heaven
2250	Better becomes the grey cheeks of the east,
2251	Nor that full star that ushers in the even
2252	Doth half that glory to the sober west,
2253	As those two mourning eyes become thy face:
2254	O, let it then as well beseem thy heart
2255	To mourn for me, since mourning doth thee grace,
2256	And suit thy pity like in every part.
2257	Then will I swear beauty herself is black
2258	And all they foul that thy complexion lack.
2259	
2260	CXXXIII.
2261	
2262	Beshrew that heart that makes my heart to groan
2263	For that deep wound it gives my friend and me!
2264	Is't not enough to torture me alone,
2265	But slave to slavery my sweet'st friend must be?
2266	Me from myself thy cruel eye hath taken,
2267	And my next self thou harder hast engross'd:
2268	Of him, myself, and thee, I am forsaken;
2269	A torment thrice threefold thus to be cross'd.
2270	Prison my heart in thy steel bosom's ward,
2271	But then my friend's heart let my poor heart bail;
2272	Whoe'er keeps me, let my heart be his guard;
2273	Thou canst not then use rigor in my gaol:
2274	And yet thou wilt; for I, being pent in thee,
2275	Perforce am thine, and all that is in me.
2276	
2277	CXXXIV.
2278	
2279	So, now I have confess'd that he is thine,
2280	And I myself am mortgaged to thy will,
2281	Myself I'll forfeit, so that other mine
2282	Thou wilt restore, to be my comfort still:
2283	But thou wilt not, nor he will not be free,
2284	For thou art covetous and he is kind;
2285	He learn'd but surety-like to write for me
2286	Under that bond that him as fast doth bind.
2287	The statute of thy beauty thou wilt take,
2288	Thou usurer, that put'st forth all to use,
2289	And sue a friend came debtor for my sake;
2290	So him I lose through my unkind abuse.
2291	Him have I lost; thou hast both him and me:
2292	He pays the whole, and yet am I not free.
2293	
2294	CXXXV.
2295	
2296	Whoever hath her wish, thou hast thy 'Will,'
2297	And 'Will' to boot, and 'Will' in overplus;
2298	More than enough am I that vex thee still,
2299	To thy sweet will making addition thus.
2300	Wilt thou, whose will is large and spacious,
2301	Not once vouchsafe to hide my will in thine?
2302	Shall will in others seem right gracious,
2303	And in my will no fair acceptance shine?
2304	The sea all water, yet receives rain still
2305	And in abundance addeth to his store;
2306	So thou, being rich in 'Will,' add to thy 'Will'
2307	One will of mine, to make thy large 'Will' more.
2308	Let no unkind, no fair beseechers kill;
2309	Think all but one, and me in that one 'Will.'
2310	
2311	CXXXVI.
2312	
2313	If thy soul cheque thee that I come so near,
2314	Swear to thy blind soul that I was thy 'Will,'
2315	And will, thy soul knows, is admitted there;
2316	Thus far for love my love-suit, sweet, fulfil.
2317	'Will' will fulfil the treasure of thy love,
2318	Ay, fill it full with wills, and my will one.
2319	In things of great receipt with ease we prove
2320	Among a number one is reckon'd none:
2321	Then in the number let me pass untold,
2322	Though in thy stores' account I one must be;
2323	For nothing hold me, so it please thee hold
2324	That nothing me, a something sweet to thee:
2325	Make but my name thy love, and love that still,
2326	And then thou lovest me, for my name is 'Will.'
2327	
2328	CXXXVII.
2329	
2330	Thou blind fool, Love, what dost thou to mine eyes,
2331	That they behold, and see not what they see?
2332	They know what beauty is, see where it lies,
2333	Yet what the best is take the worst to be.
2334	If eyes corrupt by over-partial looks
2335	Be anchor'd in the bay where all men ride,
2336	Why of eyes' falsehood hast thou forged hooks,
2337	Whereto the judgment of my heart is tied?
2338	Why should my heart think that a several plot
2339	Which my heart knows the wide world's common place?
2340	Or mine eyes seeing this, say this is not,
2341	To put fair truth upon so foul a face?
2342	In things right true my heart and eyes have erred,
2343	And to this false plague are they now transferr'd.
2344	
2345	CXXXVIII.
2346	
2347	When my love swears that she is made of truth
2348	I do believe her, though I know she lies,
2349	That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
2350	Unlearned in the world's false subtleties.
2351	Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
2352	Although she knows my days are past the best,
2353	Simply I credit her false speaking tongue:
2354	On both sides thus is simple truth suppress'd.
2355	But wherefore says she not she is unjust?
2356	And wherefore say not I that I am old?
2357	O, love's best habit is in seeming trust,
2358	And age in love loves not to have years told:
2359	Therefore I lie with her and she with me,
2360	And in our faults by lies we flatter'd be.
2361	
2362	CXXXIX.
2363	
2364	O, call not me to justify the wrong
2365	That thy unkindness lays upon my heart;
2366	Wound me not with thine eye but with thy tongue;
2367	Use power with power and slay me not by art.
2368	Tell me thou lovest elsewhere, but in my sight,
2369	Dear heart, forbear to glance thine eye aside:
2370	What need'st thou wound with cunning when thy might
2371	Is more than my o'er-press'd defense can bide?
2372	Let me excuse thee: ah! my love well knows
2373	Her pretty looks have been mine enemies,
2374	And therefore from my face she turns my foes,
2375	That they elsewhere might dart their injuries:
2376	Yet do not so; but since I am near slain,
2377	Kill me outright with looks and rid my pain.
2378	
2379	CXL.
2380	
2381	Be wise as thou art cruel; do not press
2382	My tongue-tied patience with too much disdain;
2383	Lest sorrow lend me words and words express
2384	The manner of my pity-wanting pain.
2385	If I might teach thee wit, better it were,
2386	Though not to love, yet, love, to tell me so;
2387	As testy sick men, when their deaths be near,
2388	No news but health from their physicians know;
2389	For if I should despair, I should grow mad,
2390	And in my madness might speak ill of thee:
2391	Now this ill-wresting world is grown so bad,
2392	Mad slanderers by mad ears believed be,
2393	That I may not be so, nor thou belied,
2394	Bear thine eyes straight, though thy proud heart go wide.
2395	
2396	CXLI.
2397	
2398	In faith, I do not love thee with mine eyes,
2399	For they in thee a thousand errors note;
2400	But 'tis my heart that loves what they despise,
2401	Who in despite of view is pleased to dote;
2402	Nor are mine ears with thy tongue's tune delighted,
2403	Nor tender feeling, to base touches prone,
2404	Nor taste, nor smell, desire to be invited
2405	To any sensual feast with thee alone:
2406	But my five wits nor my five senses can
2407	Dissuade one foolish heart from serving thee,
2408	Who leaves unsway'd the likeness of a man,
2409	Thy proud hearts slave and vassal wretch to be:
2410	Only my plague thus far I count my gain,
2411	That she that makes me sin awards me pain.
2412	
2413	CXLII.
2414	
2415	Love is my sin and thy dear virtue hate,
2416	Hate of my sin, grounded on sinful loving:
2417	O, but with mine compare thou thine own state,
2418	And thou shalt find it merits not reproving;
2419	Or, if it do, not from those lips of thine,
2420	That have profaned their scarlet ornaments
2421	And seal'd false bonds of love as oft as mine,
2422	Robb'd others' beds' revenues of their rents.
2423	Be it lawful I love thee, as thou lovest those
2424	Whom thine eyes woo as mine importune thee:
2425	Root pity in thy heart, that when it grows
2426	Thy pity may deserve to pitied be.
2427	If thou dost seek to have what thou dost hide,
2428	By self-example mayst thou be denied!

2431	
2432	Lo! as a careful housewife runs to catch
2433	One of her feather'd creatures broke away,
2434	Sets down her babe and makes an swift dispatch
2435	In pursuit of the thing she would have stay,
2436	Whilst her neglected child holds her in chase,
2437	Cries to catch her whose busy care is bent
2438	To follow that which flies before her face,
2439	Not prizing her poor infant's discontent;
2440	So runn'st thou after that which flies from thee,
2441	Whilst I thy babe chase thee afar behind;
2442	But if thou catch thy hope, turn back to me,
2443	And play the mother's part, kiss me, be kind:
2444	So will I pray that thou mayst have thy 'Will,'
2445	If thou turn back, and my loud crying still.

2449	Two loves I have of comfort and despair,
2450	Which like two spirits do suggest me still:
2451	The better angel is a man right fair,
2452	The worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
2453	To win me soon to hell, my female evil
2454	Tempteth my better angel from my side,
2455	And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
2456	Wooing his purity with her foul pride.
2457	And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend
2458	Suspect I may, but not directly tell;
2459	But being both from me, both to each friend,
2460	I guess one angel in another's hell:
2461	Yet this shall I ne'er know, but live in doubt,
2462	Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
2463	
2464	CXLV.
2465	
2466	Those lips that Love's own hand did make
2467	Breathed forth the sound that said 'I hate'
2468	To me that languish'd for her sake;
2469	But when she saw my woeful state,
2470	Straight in her heart did mercy come,
2471	Chiding that tongue that ever sweet
2472	Was used in giving gentle doom,
2473	And taught it thus anew to greet:
2474	'I hate' she alter'd with an end,
2475	That follow'd it as gentle day
2476	Doth follow night, who like a fiend
2477	From heaven to hell is flown away;
2478	'I hate' from hate away she threw,
2479	And saved my life, saying 'not you.'

2482	
2483	Poor soul, the centre of my sinful earth,
2484	[         ] these rebel powers that thee array;
2485	Why dost thou pine within and suffer dearth,
2486	Painting thy outward walls so costly gay?
2487	Why so large cost, having so short a lease,
2488	Dost thou upon thy fading mansion spend?
2489	Shall worms, inheritors of this excess,
2490	Eat up thy charge? is this thy body's end?
2491	Then soul, live thou upon thy servant's loss,
2492	And let that pine to aggravate thy store;
2493	Buy terms divine in selling hours of dross;
2494	Within be fed, without be rich no more:
2495	So shalt thou feed on Death, that feeds on men,
2496	And Death once dead, there's no more dying then.

2500	My love is as a fever, longing still
2501	For that which longer nurseth the disease,
2502	Feeding on that which doth preserve the ill,
2503	The uncertain sickly appetite to please.
2504	My reason, the physician to my love,
2505	Angry that his prescriptions are not kept,
2506	Hath left me, and I desperate now approve
2507	Desire is death, which physic did except.
2508	Past cure I am, now reason is past care,
2509	And frantic-mad with evermore unrest;
2510	My thoughts and my discourse as madmen's are,
2511	At random from the truth vainly express'd;
2512	For I have sworn thee fair and thought thee bright,
2513	Who art as black as hell, as dark as night.

2517	O me, what eyes hath Love put in my head,
2518	Which have no correspondence with true sight!
2519	Or, if they have, where is my judgment fled,
2520	That censures falsely what they see aright?
2521	If that be fair whereon my false eyes dote,
2522	What means the world to say it is not so?
2523	If it be not, then love doth well denote
2524	Love's eye is not so true as all men's 'No.'
2525	How can it? O, how can Love's eye be true,
2526	That is so vex'd with watching and with tears?
2527	No marvel then, though I mistake my view;
2528	The sun itself sees not till heaven clears.
2529	O cunning Love! with tears thou keep'st me blind,
2530	Lest eyes well-seeing thy foul faults should find.

2534	Canst thou, O cruel! say I love thee not,
2535	When I against myself with thee partake?
2536	Do I not think on thee, when I forgot
2537	Am of myself, all tyrant, for thy sake?
2538	Who hateth thee that I do call my friend?
2539	On whom frown'st thou that I do fawn upon?
2540	Nay, if thou lour'st on me, do I not spend
2541	Revenge upon myself with present moan?
2542	What merit do I in myself respect,
2543	That is so proud thy service to despise,
2544	When all my best doth worship thy defect,
2545	Commanded by the motion of thine eyes?
2546	But, love, hate on, for now I know thy mind;
2547	Those that can see thou lovest, and I am blind.
2548	
2549	CL.
2550	
2551	O, from what power hast thou this powerful might
2552	With insufficiency my heart to sway?
2553	To make me give the lie to my true sight,
2554	And swear that brightness doth not grace the day?
2555	Whence hast thou this becoming of things ill,
2556	That in the very refuse of thy deeds
2557	There is such strength and warrantize of skill
2558	That, in my mind, thy worst all best exceeds?
2559	Who taught thee how to make me love thee more
2560	The more I hear and see just cause of hate?
2561	O, though I love what others do abhor,
2562	With others thou shouldst not abhor my state:
2563	If thy unworthiness raised love in me,
2564	More worthy I to be beloved of thee.
2565	
2566	CLI.
2567	
2568	Love is too young to know what conscience is;
2569	Yet who knows not conscience is born of love?
2570	Then, gentle cheater, urge not my amiss,
2571	Lest guilty of my faults thy sweet self prove:
2572	For, thou betraying me, I do betray
2573	My nobler part to my gross body's treason;
2574	My soul doth tell my body that he may
2575	Triumph in love; flesh stays no father reason;
2576	But, rising at thy name, doth point out thee
2577	As his triumphant prize. Proud of this pride,
2578	He is contented thy poor drudge to be,
2579	To stand in thy affairs, fall by thy side.
2580	No want of conscience hold it that I call
2581	Her 'love' for whose dear love I rise and fall.
2582	
2583	CLII.
2584	
2585	In loving thee thou know'st I am forsworn,
2586	But thou art twice forsworn, to me love swearing,
2587	In act thy bed-vow broke and new faith torn,
2588	In vowing new hate after new love bearing.
2589	But why of two oaths' breach do I accuse thee,
2590	When I break twenty? I am perjured most;
2591	For all my vows are oaths but to misuse thee
2592	And all my honest faith in thee is lost,
2593	For I have sworn deep oaths of thy deep kindness,
2594	Oaths of thy love, thy truth, thy constancy,
2595	And, to enlighten thee, gave eyes to blindness,
2596	Or made them swear against the thing they see;
2597	For I have sworn thee fair; more perjured I,
2598	To swear against the truth so foul a lie!
2599	
2600	CLIII.
2601	
2602	Cupid laid by his brand, and fell asleep:
2603	A maid of Dian's this advantage found,
2604	And his love-kindling fire did quickly steep
2605	In a cold valley-fountain of that ground;
2606	Which borrow'd from this holy fire of Love
2607	A dateless lively heat, still to endure,
2608	And grew a seething bath, which yet men prove
2609	Against strange maladies a sovereign cure.
2610	But at my mistress' eye Love's brand new-fired,
2611	The boy for trial needs would touch my breast;
2612	I, sick withal, the help of bath desired,
2613	And thither hied, a sad distemper'd guest,
2614	But found no cure: the bath for my help lies
2615	Where Cupid got new fire--my mistress' eyes.
2616	
2617	CLIV.
2618	
2619	The little Love-god lying once asleep
2620	Laid by his side his heart-inflaming brand,
2621	Whilst many nymphs that vow'd chaste life to keep
2622	Came tripping by; but in her maiden hand
2623	The fairest votary took up that fire
2624	Which many legions of true hearts had warm'd;
2625	And so the general of hot desire
2626	Was sleeping by a virgin hand disarm'd.
2627	This brand she quenched in a cool well by,
2628	Which from Love's fire took heat perpetual,
2629	Growing a bath and healthful remedy
2630	For men diseased; but I, my mistress' thrall,
2631	Came there for cure, and this by that I prove,
2632	Love's fire heats water, water cools not love.

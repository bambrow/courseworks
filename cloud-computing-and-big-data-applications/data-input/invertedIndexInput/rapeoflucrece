3	RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY,
4	Earl of Southampton, and Baron of Tichfield.

7	The love I dedicate to your lordship is without end; whereof
8	this pamphlet, without beginning, is but a superfluous moiety.
9	The warrant I have of your honourable disposition, not the worth
10	of my untutored lines, makes it assured of acceptance. What I
11	have done is yours; what I have to do is yours; being part in
12	all I have, devoted yours. Were my worth greater, my duty would
13	show greater; meantime, as it is, it is bound to your lordship,
14	to whom I wish long life, still lengthened with all happiness.
15	
16	Your lordship's in all duty,
17	WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

24	THE ARGUMENT
25	
26	
27	Lucius Tarquinius, for his excessive pride surnamed Superbus,
28	after he had caused his own father-in-law Servius Tullius to be
29	cruelly murdered, and, contrary to the Roman laws and customs,
30	not requiring or staying for the people's suffrages, had
31	possessed himself of the kingdom, went, accompanied with his sons
32	and other noblemen of Rome, to besiege Ardea. During which siege
33	the principal men of the army meeting one evening at the tent of
34	Sextus Tarquinius, the king's son, in their discourses after
35	supper every one commended the virtues of his own wife: among
36	whom Collatinus extolled the incomparable chastity of his wife
37	Lucretia. In that pleasant humour they posted to Rome; and
38	intending, by their secret and sudden arrival, to make trial of
39	that which every one had before avouched, only Collatinus finds
40	his wife, though it were late in the night, spinning amongst her
41	maids: the other ladies were all found dancing and revelling, or
42	in several disports. Whereupon the noblemen yielded Collatinus
43	the victory, and his wife the fame. At that time Sextus
44	Tarquinius being inflamed with Lucrece' beauty, yet smothering
45	his passions for the present, departed with the rest back to the
46	camp; from whence he shortly after privily withdrew himself, and
47	was, according to his estate, royally entertained and lodged by
48	Lucrece at Collatium. The same night he treacherously stealeth
49	into her chamber, violently ravished her, and early in the
50	morning speedeth away. Lucrece, in this lamentable plight,
51	hastily dispatcheth messengers, one to Rome for her father,
52	another to the camp for Collatine. They came, the one
53	accompanied with Junius Brutus, the other with Publius Valerius;
54	and finding Lucrece attired in mourning habit, demanded the cause
55	of her sorrow. She, first taking an oath of them for her
56	revenge, revealed the actor, and whole manner of his dealing, and
57	withal suddenly stabbed herself. Which done, with one consent
58	they all vowed to root out the whole hated family of the
59	Tarquins; and bearing the dead body to Rome, Brutus acquainted
60	the people with the doer and manner of the vile deed, with a
61	bitter invective against the tyranny of the king: wherewith the
62	people were so moved, that with one consent and a general
63	acclamation the Tarquins were all exiled, and the state
64	government changed from kings to consuls.

67	
68	THE RAPE OF LUCRECE
69	
70	
71	
72	FROM the besieged Ardea all in post,
73	Borne by the trustless wings of false desire,
74	Lust-breathed Tarquin leaves the Roman host,
75	And to Collatium bears the lightless fire
76	Which, in pale embers hid, lurks to aspire
77	And girdle with embracing flames the waist
78	Of Collatine's fair love, Lucrece the chaste.
79	
80	Haply that name of 'chaste' unhappily set
81	This bateless edge on his keen appetite;
82	When Collatine unwisely did not let
83	To praise the clear unmatched red and white
84	Which triumph'd in that sky of his delight,
85	Where mortal stars, as bright as heaven's beauties,
86	With pure aspects did him peculiar duties.
87	
88	For he the night before, in Tarquin's tent,
89	Unlock'd the treasure of his happy state;
90	What priceless wealth the heavens had him lent
91	In the possession of his beauteous mate;
92	Reckoning his fortune at such high-proud rate,
93	That kings might be espoused to more fame,
94	But king nor peer to such a peerless dame.
95	
96	O happiness enjoy'd but of a few!
97	And, if possess'd, as soon decay'd and done
98	As is the morning's silver-melting dew
99	Against the golden splendor of the sun!
100	An expired date, cancell'd ere well begun:
101	Honour and beauty, in the owner's arms,
102	Are weakly fortress'd from a world of harms.
103	
104	Beauty itself doth of itself persuade
105	The eyes of men without an orator;
106	What needeth then apologies be made,
107	To set forth that which is so singular?
108	Or why is Collatine the publisher
109	Of that rich jewel he should keep unknown
110	From thievish ears, because it is his own?
111	
112	Perchance his boast of Lucrece' sovereignty
113	Suggested this proud issue of a king;
114	For by our ears our hearts oft tainted be:
115	Perchance that envy of so rich a thing,
116	Braving compare, disdainfully did sting
117	His high-pitch'd thoughts, that meaner men should vaunt
118	That golden hap which their superiors want.
119	
120	But some untimely thought did instigate
121	His all-too-timeless speed, if none of those:
122	His honour, his affairs, his friends, his state,
123	Neglected all, with swift intent he goes
124	To quench the coal which in his liver glows.
125	O rash false heat, wrapp'd in repentant cold,
126	Thy hasty spring still blasts, and ne'er grows old!
127	
128	When at Collatium this false lord arrived,
129	Well was he welcomed by the Roman dame,
130	Within whose face beauty and virtue strived
131	Which of them both should underprop her fame:
132	When virtue bragg'd, beauty would blush for shame;
133	When beauty boasted blushes, in despite
134	Virtue would stain that o'er with silver white.
135	
136	But beauty, in that white intituled,
137	From Venus' doves doth challenge that fair field:
138	Then virtue claims from beauty beauty's red,
139	Which virtue gave the golden age to gild
140	Their silver cheeks, and call'd it then their shield;
141	Teaching them thus to use it in the fight,
142	When shame assail'd, the red should fence the white.
143	
144	This heraldry in Lucrece' face was seen,
145	Argued by beauty's red and virtue's white
146	Of either's colour was the other queen,
147	Proving from world's minority their right:
148	Yet their ambition makes them still to fight;
149	The sovereignty of either being so great,
150	That oft they interchange each other's seat.
151	
152	Their silent war of lilies and of roses,
153	Which Tarquin view'd in her fair face's field,
154	In their pure ranks his traitor eye encloses;
155	Where, lest between them both it should be kill'd,
156	The coward captive vanquished doth yield
157	To those two armies that would let him go,
158	Rather than triumph in so false a foe.
159	
160	Now thinks he that her husband's shallow tongue,--
161	The niggard prodigal that praised her so,--
162	In that high task hath done her beauty wrong,
163	Which far exceeds his barren skill to show:
164	Therefore that praise which Collatine doth owe
165	Enchanted Tarquin answers with surmise,
166	In silent wonder of still-gazing eyes.
167	
168	This earthly saint, adored by this devil,
169	Little suspecteth the false worshipper;
170	For unstain'd thoughts do seldom dream on evil;
171	Birds never limed no secret bushes fear:
172	So guiltless she securely gives good cheer
173	And reverend welcome to her princely guest,
174	Whose inward ill no outward harm express'd:
175	
176	For that he colour'd with his high estate,
177	Hiding base sin in plaits of majesty;
178	That nothing in him seem'd inordinate,
179	Save something too much wonder of his eye,
180	Which, having all, all could not satisfy;
181	But, poorly rich, so wanteth in his store,
182	That, cloy'd with much, he pineth still for more.
183	
184	But she, that never coped with stranger eyes,
185	Could pick no meaning from their parling looks,
186	Nor read the subtle-shining secrecies
187	Writ in the glassy margents of such books:
188	She touch'd no unknown baits, nor fear'd no hooks;
189	Nor could she moralize his wanton sight,
190	More than his eyes were open'd to the light.
191	
192	He stories to her ears her husband's fame,
193	Won in the fields of fruitful Italy;
194	And decks with praises Collatine's high name,
195	Made glorious by his manly chivalry
196	With bruised arms and wreaths of victory:
197	Her joy with heaved-up hand she doth express,
198	And, wordless, so greets heaven for his success.
199	
200	Far from the purpose of his coming hither,
201	He makes excuses for his being there:
202	No cloudy show of stormy blustering weather
203	Doth yet in his fair welkin once appear;
204	Till sable Night, mother of Dread and Fear,
205	Upon the world dim darkness doth display,
206	And in her vaulty prison stows the Day.
207	
208	For then is Tarquin brought unto his bed,
209	Intending weariness with heavy spright;
210	For, after supper, long he questioned
211	With modest Lucrece, and wore out the night:
212	Now leaden slumber with life's strength doth fight;
213	And every one to rest themselves betake,
214	Save thieves, and cares, and troubled minds, that wake.
215	
216	As one of which doth Tarquin lie revolving
217	The sundry dangers of his will's obtaining;
218	Yet ever to obtain his will resolving,
219	Though weak-built hopes persuade him to abstaining:
220	Despair to gain doth traffic oft for gaining;
221	And when great treasure is the meed proposed,
222	Though death be adjunct, there's no death supposed.
223	
224	Those that much covet are with gain so fond,
225	For what they have not, that which they possess
226	They scatter and unloose it from their bond,
227	And so, by hoping more, they have but less;
228	Or, gaining more, the profit of excess
229	Is but to surfeit, and such griefs sustain,
230	That they prove bankrupt in this poor-rich gain.
231	
232	The aim of all is but to nurse the life
233	With honour, wealth, and ease, in waning age;
234	And in this aim there is such thwarting strife,
235	That one for all, or all for one we gage;
236	As life for honour in fell battle's rage;
237	Honour for wealth; and oft that wealth doth cost
238	The death of all, and all together lost.
239	
240	So that in venturing ill we leave to be
241	The things we are for that which we expect;
242	And this ambitious foul infirmity,
243	In having much, torments us with defect
244	Of that we have: so then we do neglect
245	The thing we have; and, all for want of wit,
246	Make something nothing by augmenting it.
247	
248	Such hazard now must doting Tarquin make,
249	Pawning his honour to obtain his lust;
250	And for himself himself be must forsake:
251	Then where is truth, if there be no self-trust?
252	When shall he think to find a stranger just,
253	When he himself himself confounds, betrays
254	To slanderous tongues and wretched hateful days?
255	
256	Now stole upon the time the dead of night,
257	When heavy sleep had closed up mortal eyes:
258	No comfortable star did lend his light,
259	No noise but owls' and wolves' death-boding cries;
260	Now serves the season that they may surprise
261	The silly lambs: pure thoughts are dead and still,
262	While lust and murder wake to stain and kill.
263	
264	And now this lustful lord leap'd from his bed,
265	Throwing his mantle rudely o'er his arm;
266	Is madly toss'd between desire and dread;
267	Th' one sweetly flatters, th' other feareth harm;
268	But honest fear, bewitch'd with lust's foul charm,
269	Doth too too oft betake him to retire,
270	Beaten away by brain-sick rude desire.
271	
272	His falchion on a flint he softly smiteth,
273	That from the cold stone sparks of fire do fly;
274	Whereat a waxen torch forthwith he lighteth,
275	Which must be lode-star to his lustful eye;
276	And to the flame thus speaks advisedly,
277	'As from this cold flint I enforced this fire,
278	So Lucrece must I force to my desire.'
279	
280	Here pale with fear he doth premeditate
281	The dangers of his loathsome enterprise,
282	And in his inward mind he doth debate
283	What following sorrow may on this arise:
284	Then looking scornfully, he doth despise
285	His naked armour of still-slaughter'd lust,
286	And justly thus controls his thoughts unjust:
287	
288	'Fair torch, burn out thy light, and lend it not
289	To darken her whose light excelleth thine:
290	And die, unhallow'd thoughts, before you blot
291	With your uncleanness that which is divine;
292	Offer pure incense to so pure a shrine:
293	Let fair humanity abhor the deed
294	That spots and stains love's modest snow-white weed.
295	
296	'O shame to knighthood and to shining arms!
297	O foul dishonour to my household's grave!
298	O impious act, including all foul harms!
299	A martial man to be soft fancy's slave!
300	True valour still a true respect should have;
301	Then my digression is so vile, so base,
302	That it will live engraven in my face.
303	
304	'Yea, though I die, the scandal will survive,
305	And be an eye-sore in my golden coat;
306	Some loathsome dash the herald will contrive,
307	To cipher me how fondly I did dote;
308	That my posterity, shamed with the note
309	Shall curse my bones, and hold it for no sin
310	To wish that I their father had not bin.
311	
312	'What win I, if I gain the thing I seek?
313	A dream, a breath, a froth of fleeting joy.
314	Who buys a minute's mirth to wail a week?
315	Or sells eternity to get a toy?
316	For one sweet grape who will the vine destroy?
317	Or what fond beggar, but to touch the crown,
318	Would with the sceptre straight be strucken down?
319	
320	'If Collatinus dream of my intent,
321	Will he not wake, and in a desperate rage
322	Post hither, this vile purpose to prevent?
323	This siege that hath engirt his marriage,
324	This blur to youth, this sorrow to the sage,
325	This dying virtue, this surviving shame,
326	Whose crime will bear an ever-during blame?
327	
328	'O, what excuse can my invention make,
329	When thou shalt charge me with so black a deed?
330	Will not my tongue be mute, my frail joints shake,
331	Mine eyes forego their light, my false heart bleed?
332	The guilt being great, the fear doth still exceed;
333	And extreme fear can neither fight nor fly,
334	But coward-like with trembling terror die.
335	
336	
337	'Had Collatinus kill'd my son or sire,
338	Or lain in ambush to betray my life,
339	Or were he not my dear friend, this desire
340	Might have excuse to work upon his wife,
341	As in revenge or quittal of such strife:
342	But as he is my kinsman, my dear friend,
343	The shame and fault finds no excuse nor end.
344	
345	'Shameful it is; ay, if the fact be known:
346	Hateful it is; there is no hate in loving:
347	I'll beg her love; but she is own:
348	The worst is but denial and reproving:
349	My will is strong, past reason's weak removing.
350	Who fears a sentence or an old man's saw
351	Shall by a painted cloth be kept in awe.'
352	
353	Thus, graceless, holds he disputation
354	'Tween frozen conscience and hot-burning will,
355	And with good thoughts make dispensation,
356	Urging the worser sense for vantage still;
357	Which in a moment doth confound and kill
358	All pure effects, and doth so far proceed,
359	That what is vile shows like a virtuous deed.
360	
361	Quoth he, 'She took me kindly by the hand,
362	And gazed for tidings in my eager eyes,
363	Fearing some hard news from the warlike band,
364	Where her beloved Collatinus lies.
365	O, how her fear did make her colour rise!
366	First red as roses that on lawn we lay,
367	Then white as lawn, the roses took away.
368	
369	'And how her hand, in my hand being lock'd
370	Forced it to tremble with her loyal fear!
371	Which struck her sad, and then it faster rock'd,
372	Until her husband's welfare she did hear;
373	Whereat she smiled with so sweet a cheer,
374	That had Narcissus seen her as she stood,
375	Self-love had never drown'd him in the flood.
376	
377	'Why hunt I then for colour or excuses?
378	All orators are dumb when beauty pleadeth;
379	Poor wretches have remorse in poor abuses;
380	Love thrives not in the heart that shadows dreadeth:
381	Affection is my captain, and he leadeth;
382	And when his gaudy banner is display'd,
383	The coward fights and will not be dismay'd.
384	
385	'Then, childish fear, avaunt! debating, die!
386	Respect and reason, wait on wrinkled age!
387	My heart shall never countermand mine eye:
388	Sad pause and deep regard beseem the sage;
389	My part is youth, and beats these from the stage:
390	Desire my pilot is, beauty my prize;
391	Then who fears sinking where such treasure lies?'
392	
393	As corn o'ergrown by weeds, so heedful fear
394	Is almost choked by unresisted lust.
395	Away he steals with open listening ear,
396	Full of foul hope and full of fond mistrust;
397	Both which, as servitors to the unjust,
398	So cross him with their opposite persuasion,
399	That now he vows a league, and now invasion.
400	
401	Within his thought her heavenly image sits,
402	And in the self-same seat sits Collatine:
403	That eye which looks on her confounds his wits;
404	That eye which him beholds, as more divine,
405	Unto a view so false will not incline;
406	But with a pure appeal seeks to the heart,
407	Which once corrupted takes the worser part;
408	
409	And therein heartens up his servile powers,
410	Who, flatter'd by their leader's jocund show,
411	Stuff up his lust, as minutes fill up hours;
412	And as their captain, so their pride doth grow,
413	Paying more slavish tribute than they owe.
414	By reprobate desire thus madly led,
415	The Roman lord marcheth to Lucrece' bed.
416	
417	The locks between her chamber and his will,
418	Each one by him enforced, retires his ward;
419	But, as they open, they all rate his ill,
420	Which drives the creeping thief to some regard:
421	The threshold grates the door to have him heard;
422	Night-wandering weasels shriek to see him there;
423	They fright him, yet he still pursues his fear.
424	
425	As each unwilling portal yields him way,
426	Through little vents and crannies of the place
427	The wind wars with his torch to make him stay,
428	And blows the smoke of it into his face,
429	Extinguishing his conduct in this case;
430	But his hot heart, which fond desire doth scorch,
431	Puffs forth another wind that fires the torch:
432	
433	And being lighted, by the light he spies
434	Lucretia's glove, wherein her needle sticks:
435	He takes it from the rushes where it lies,
436	And griping it, the needle his finger pricks;
437	As who should say 'This glove to wanton tricks
438	Is not inured; return again in haste;
439	Thou see'st our mistress' ornaments are chaste.'
440	
441	But all these poor forbiddings could not stay him;
442	He in the worst sense construes their denial:
443	The doors, the wind, the glove, that did delay him,
444	He takes for accidental things of trial;
445	Or as those bars which stop the hourly dial,
446	Who with a lingering slay his course doth let,
447	Till every minute pays the hour his debt.
448	
449	'So, so,' quoth he, 'these lets attend the time,
450	Like little frosts that sometime threat the spring,
451	To add a more rejoicing to the prime,
452	And give the sneaped birds more cause to sing.
453	Pain pays the income of each precious thing;
454	Huge rocks, high winds, strong pirates, shelves and sands,
455	The merchant fears, ere rich at home he lands.'
456	
457	Now is he come unto the chamber-door,
458	That shuts him from the heaven of his thought,
459	Which with a yielding latch, and with no more,
460	Hath barr'd him from the blessed thing be sought.
461	So from himself impiety hath wrought,
462	That for his prey to pray he doth begin,
463	As if the heavens should countenance his sin.
464	
465	But in the midst of his unfruitful prayer,
466	Having solicited th' eternal power
467	That his foul thoughts might compass his fair fair,
468	And they would stand auspicious to the hour,
469	Even there he starts: quoth he, 'I must deflower:
470	The powers to whom I pray abhor this fact,
471	How can they then assist me in the act?
472	
473	'Then Love and Fortune be my gods, my guide!
474	My will is back'd with resolution:
475	Thoughts are but dreams till their effects be tried;
476	The blackest sin is clear'd with absolution;
477	Against love's fire fear's frost hath dissolution.
478	The eye of heaven is out, and misty night
479	Covers the shame that follows sweet delight.'
480	
481	This said, his guilty hand pluck'd up the latch,
482	And with his knee the door he opens wide.
483	The dove sleeps fast that this night-owl will catch:
484	Thus treason works ere traitors be espied.
485	Who sees the lurking serpent steps aside;
486	But she, sound sleeping, fearing no such thing,
487	Lies at the mercy of his mortal sting.
488	
489	Into the chamber wickedly he stalks,
490	And gazeth on her yet unstained bed.
491	The curtains being close, about he walks,
492	Rolling his greedy eyeballs in his head:
493	By their high treason is his heart misled;
494	Which gives the watch-word to his hand full soon
495	To draw the cloud that hides the silver moon.
496	
497	Look, as the fair and fiery-pointed sun,
498	Rushing from forth a cloud, bereaves our sight;
499	Even so, the curtain drawn, his eyes begun
500	To wink, being blinded with a greater light:
501	Whether it is that she reflects so bright,
502	That dazzleth them, or else some shame supposed;
503	But blind they are, and keep themselves enclosed.
504	
505	O, had they in that darksome prison died!
506	Then had they seen the period of their ill;
507	Then Collatine again, by Lucrece' side,
508	In his clear bed might have reposed still:
509	But they must ope, this blessed league to kill;
510	And holy-thoughted Lucrece to their sight
511	Must sell her joy, her life, her world's delight.
512	
513	Her lily hand her rosy cheek lies under,
514	Cozening the pillow of a lawful kiss;
515	Who, therefore angry, seems to part in sunder,
516	Swelling on either side to want his bliss;
517	Between whose hills her head entombed is:
518	Where, like a virtuous monument, she lies,
519	To be admired of lewd unhallow'd eyes.
520	
521	Without the bed her other fair hand was,
522	On the green coverlet; whose perfect white
523	Show'd like an April daisy on the grass,
524	With pearly sweat, resembling dew of night.
525	Her eyes, like marigolds, had sheathed their light,
526	And canopied in darkness sweetly lay,
527	Till they might open to adorn the day.
528	
529	Her hair, like golden threads, play'd with her breath;
530	O modest wantons! wanton modesty!
531	Showing life's triumph in the map of death,
532	And death's dim look in life's mortality:
533	Each in her sleep themselves so beautify,
534	As if between them twain there were no strife,
535	But that life lived in death, and death in life.
536	
537	Her breasts, like ivory globes circled with blue,
538	A pair of maiden worlds unconquered,
539	Save of their lord no bearing yoke they knew,
540	And him by oath they truly honoured.
541	These worlds in Tarquin new ambition bred;
542	Who, like a foul ursurper, went about
543	From this fair throne to heave the owner out.
544	
545	What could he see but mightily he noted?
546	What did he note but strongly he desired?
547	What he beheld, on that he firmly doted,
548	And in his will his wilful eye he tired.
549	With more than admiration he admired
550	Her azure veins, her alabaster skin,
551	Her coral lips, her snow-white dimpled chin.
552	
553	As the grim lion fawneth o'er his prey,
554	Sharp hunger by the conquest satisfied,
555	So o'er this sleeping soul doth Tarquin stay,
556	His rage of lust by gazing qualified;
557	Slack'd, not suppress'd; for standing by her side,
558	His eye, which late this mutiny restrains,
559	Unto a greater uproar tempts his veins:
560	
561	And they, like straggling slaves for pillage fighting,
562	Obdurate vassals fell exploits effecting,
563	In bloody death and ravishment delighting,
564	Nor children's tears nor mothers' groans respecting,
565	Swell in their pride, the onset still expecting:
566	Anon his beating heart, alarum striking,
567	Gives the hot charge and bids them do their liking.
568	
569	His drumming heart cheers up his burning eye,
570	His eye commends the leading to his hand;
571	His hand, as proud of such a dignity,
572	Smoking with pride, march'd on to make his stand
573	On her bare breast, the heart of all her land;
574	Whose ranks of blue veins, as his hand did scale,
575	Left there round turrets destitute and pale.
576	
577	They, mustering to the quiet cabinet
578	Where their dear governess and lady lies,
579	Do tell her she is dreadfully beset,
580	And fright her with confusion of their cries:
581	She, much amazed, breaks ope her lock'd-up eyes,
582	Who, peeping forth this tumult to behold,
583	Are by his flaming torch dimm'd and controll'd.
584	
585	Imagine her as one in dead of night
586	From forth dull sleep by dreadful fancy waking,
587	That thinks she hath beheld some ghastly sprite,
588	Whose grim aspect sets every joint a-shaking;
589	What terror or 'tis! but she, in worser taking,
590	From sleep disturbed, heedfully doth view
591	The sight which makes supposed terror true.
592	
593	Wrapp'd and confounded in a thousand fears,
594	Like to a new-kill'd bird she trembling lies;
595	She dares not look; yet, winking, there appears
596	Quick-shifting antics, ugly in her eyes:
597	Such shadows are the weak brain's forgeries;
598	Who, angry that the eyes fly from their lights,
599	In darkness daunts them with more dreadful sights.
600	
601	His hand, that yet remains upon her breast,--
602	Rude ram, to batter such an ivory wall!--
603	May feel her heart-poor citizen!--distress'd,
604	Wounding itself to death, rise up and fall,
605	Beating her bulk, that his hand shakes withal.
606	This moves in him more rage and lesser pity,
607	To make the breach and enter this sweet city.
608	
609	First, like a trumpet, doth his tongue begin
610	To sound a parley to his heartless foe;
611	Who o'er the white sheet peers her whiter chin,
612	The reason of this rash alarm to know,
613	Which he by dumb demeanor seeks to show;
614	But she with vehement prayers urgeth still
615	Under what colour he commits this ill.
616	
617	Thus he replies: 'The colour in thy face,
618	That even for anger makes the lily pale,
619	And the red rose blush at her own disgrace,
620	Shall plead for me and tell my loving tale:
621	Under that colour am I come to scale
622	Thy never-conquer'd fort: the fault is thine,
623	For those thine eyes betray thee unto mine.
624	
625	'Thus I forestall thee, if thou mean to chide:
626	Thy beauty hath ensnared thee to this night,
627	Where thou with patience must my will abide;
628	My will that marks thee for my earth's delight,
629	Which I to conquer sought with all my might;
630	But as reproof and reason beat it dead,
631	By thy bright beauty was it newly bred.
632	
633	'I see what crosses my attempt will bring;
634	I know what thorns the growing rose defends;
635	I think the honey guarded with a sting;
636	All this beforehand counsel comprehends:
637	But will is deaf and hears no heedful friends;
638	Only he hath an eye to gaze on beauty,
639	And dotes on what he looks, 'gainst law or duty.
640	
641	'I have debated, even in my soul,
642	What wrong, what shame, what sorrow I shall breed;
643	But nothing can affection's course control,
644	Or stop the headlong fury of his speed.
645	I know repentant tears ensue the deed,
646	Reproach, disdain, and deadly enmity;
647	Yet strive I to embrace mine infamy.'
648	
649	This said, he shakes aloft his Roman blade,
650	Which, like a falcon towering in the skies,
651	Coucheth the fowl below with his wings' shade,
652	Whose crooked beak threats if he mount he dies:
653	So under his insulting falchion lies
654	Harmless Lucretia, marking what he tells
655	With trembling fear, as fowl hear falcon's bells.
656	
657	'Lucrece,' quoth he,'this night I must enjoy thee:
658	If thou deny, then force must work my way,
659	For in thy bed I purpose to destroy thee:
660	That done, some worthless slave of thine I'll slay,
661	To kill thine honour with thy life's decay;
662	And in thy dead arms do I mean to place him,
663	Swearing I slew him, seeing thee embrace him.
664	
665	'So thy surviving husband shall remain
666	The scornful mark of every open eye;
667	Thy kinsmen hang their heads at this disdain,
668	Thy issue blurr'd with nameless bastardy:
669	And thou, the author of their obloquy,
670	Shalt have thy trespass cited up in rhymes,
671	And sung by children in succeeding times.
672	
673	'But if thou yield, I rest thy secret friend:
674	The fault unknown is as a thought unacted;
675	A little harm done to a great good end
676	For lawful policy remains enacted.
677	The poisonous simple sometimes is compacted
678	In a pure compound; being so applied,
679	His venom in effect is purified.
680	
681	'Then, for thy husband and thy children's sake,
682	Tender my suit: bequeath not to their lot
683	The shame that from them no device can take,
684	The blemish that will never be forgot;
685	Worse than a slavish wipe or birth-hour's blot:
686	For marks descried in men's nativity
687	Are nature's faults, not their own infamy.'
688	
689	Here with a cockatrice' dead-killing eye
690	He rouseth up himself and makes a pause;
691	While she, the picture of pure piety,
692	Like a white hind under the gripe's sharp claws,
693	Pleads, in a wilderness where are no laws,
694	To the rough beast that knows no gentle right,
695	Nor aught obeys but his foul appetite.
696	
697	But when a black-faced cloud the world doth threat,
698	In his dim mist the aspiring mountains hiding,
699	From earth's dark womb some gentle gust doth get,
700	Which blows these pitchy vapours from their bidding,
701	Hindering their present fall by this dividing;
702	So his unhallow'd haste her words delays,
703	And moody Pluto winks while Orpheus plays.
704	
705	Yet, foul night-waking cat, he doth but dally,
706	While in his hold-fast foot the weak mouse panteth:
707	Her sad behavior feeds his vulture folly,
708	A swallowing gulf that even in plenty wanteth:
709	His ear her prayers admits, but his heart granteth
710	No penetrable entrance to her plaining:
711	Tears harden lust, though marble wear with raining.
712	
713	Her pity-pleading eyes are sadly fix'd
714	In the remorseless wrinkles of his face;
715	Her modest eloquence with sighs is mix'd,
716	Which to her oratory adds more grace.
717	She puts the period often from his place;
718	And midst the sentence so her accent breaks,
719	That twice she doth begin ere once she speaks.
720	
721	She conjures him by high almighty Jove,
722	By knighthood, gentry, and sweet friendship's oath,
723	By her untimely tears, her husband's love,
724	By holy human law, and common troth,
725	By heaven and earth, and all the power of both,
726	That to his borrow'd bed he make retire,
727	And stoop to honour, not to foul desire.
728	
729	Quoth she, 'Reward not hospitality
730	With such black payment as thou hast pretended;
731	Mud not the fountain that gave drink to thee;
732	Mar not the thing that cannot be amended;
733	End thy ill aim before thy shoot be ended;
734	He is no woodman that doth bend his bow
735	To strike a poor unseasonable doe.
736	
737	'My husband is thy friend; for his sake spare me:
738	Thyself art mighty; for thine own sake leave me:
739	Myself a weakling; do not then ensnare me:
740	Thou look'st not like deceit; do not deceive me.
741	My sighs, like whirlwinds, labour hence to heave thee:
742	If ever man were moved with woman moans,
743	Be moved with my tears, my sighs, my groans:
744	
745	'All which together, like a troubled ocean,
746	Beat at thy rocky and wreck-threatening heart,
747	To soften it with their continual motion;
748	For stones dissolved to water do convert.
749	O, if no harder than a stone thou art,
750	Melt at my tears, and be compassionate!
751	Soft pity enters at an iron gate.
752	
753	'In Tarquin's likeness I did entertain thee:
754	Hast thou put on his shape to do him shame?
755	To all the host of heaven I complain me,
756	Thou wrong'st his honour, wound'st his princely name.
757	Thou art not what thou seem'st; and if the same,
758	Thou seem'st not what thou art, a god, a king;
759	For kings like gods should govern everything.
760	
761	'How will thy shame be seeded in thine age,
762	When thus thy vices bud before thy spring!
763	If in thy hope thou darest do such outrage,
764	What darest thou not when once thou art a king?
765	O, be remember'd, no outrageous thing
766	From vassal actors can be wiped away;
767	Then kings' misdeeds cannot be hid in clay.
768	
769	'This deed will make thee only loved for fear;
770	But happy monarchs still are fear'd for love:
771	With foul offenders thou perforce must bear,
772	When they in thee the like offences prove:
773	If but for fear of this, thy will remove;
774	For princes are the glass, the school, the book,
775	Where subjects' eyes do learn, do read, do look.
776	
777	'And wilt thou be the school where Lust shall learn?
778	Must he in thee read lectures of such shame?
779	Wilt thou be glass wherein it shall discern
780	Authority for sin, warrant for blame,
781	To privilege dishonour in thy name?
782	Thou black'st reproach against long-living laud,
783	And makest fair reputation but a bawd.
784	
785	'Hast thou command? by him that gave it thee,
786	From a pure heart command thy rebel will:
787	Draw not thy sword to guard iniquity,
788	For it was lent thee all that brood to kill.
789	Thy princely office how canst thou fulfil,
790	When, pattern'd by thy fault, foul sin may say,
791	He learn'd to sin, and thou didst teach the way?
792	
793	'Think but how vile a spectacle it were,
794	To view thy present trespass in another.
795	Men's faults do seldom to themselves appear;
796	Their own transgressions partially they smother:
797	This guilt would seem death-worthy in thy brother.
798	O, how are they wrapp'd in with infamies
799	That from their own misdeeds askance their eyes!
800	
801	'To thee, to thee, my heaved-up hands appeal,
802	Not to seducing lust, thy rash relier:
803	I sue for exiled majesty's repeal;
804	Let him return, and flattering thoughts retire:
805	His true respect will prison false desire,
806	And wipe the dim mist from thy doting eyne,
807	That thou shalt see thy state and pity mine.'
808	
809	'Have done,' quoth he: 'my uncontrolled tide
810	Turns not, but swells the higher by this let.
811	Small lights are soon blown out, huge fires abide,
812	And with the wind in greater fury fret:
813	The petty streams that pay a daily debt
814	To their salt sovereign, with their fresh falls' haste
815	Add to his flow, but alter not his taste.'
816	
817	'Thou art,' quoth she, 'a sea, a sovereign king;
818	And, lo, there falls into thy boundless flood
819	Black lust, dishonour, shame, misgoverning,
820	Who seek to stain the ocean of thy blood.
821	If all these pretty ills shall change thy good,
822	Thy sea within a puddle's womb is hearsed,
823	And not the puddle in thy sea dispersed.
824	
825	'So shall these slaves be king, and thou their slave;
826	Thou nobly base, they basely dignified;
827	Thou their fair life, and they thy fouler grave:
828	Thou loathed in their shame, they in thy pride:
829	The lesser thing should not the greater hide;
830	The cedar stoops not to the base shrub's foot,
831	But low shrubs wither at the cedar's root.
832	
833	'So let thy thoughts, low vassals to thy state'--
834	No more,' quoth he; 'by heaven, I will not hear thee:
835	Yield to my love; if not, enforced hate,
836	Instead of love's coy touch, shall rudely tear thee;
837	That done, despitefully I mean to bear thee
838	Unto the base bed of some rascal groom,
839	To be thy partner in this shameful doom.'
840	
841	This said, he sets his foot upon the light,
842	For light and lust are deadly enemies:
843	Shame folded up in blind concealing night,
844	When most unseen, then most doth tyrannize.
845	The wolf hath seized his prey, the poor lamb cries;
846	Till with her own white fleece her voice controll'd
847	Entombs her outcry in her lips' sweet fold:
848	
849	For with the nightly linen that she wears
850	He pens her piteous clamours in her head;
851	Cooling his hot face in the chastest tears
852	That ever modest eyes with sorrow shed.
853	O, that prone lust should stain so pure a bed!
854	The spots whereof could weeping purify,
855	Her tears should drop on them perpetually.
856	
857	But she hath lost a dearer thing than life,
858	And he hath won what he would lose again:
859	This forced league doth force a further strife;
860	This momentary joy breeds months of pain;
861	This hot desire converts to cold disdain:
862	Pure Chastity is rifled of her store,
863	And Lust, the thief, far poorer than before.
864	
865	Look, as the full-fed hound or gorged hawk,
866	Unapt for tender smell or speedy flight,
867	Make slow pursuit, or altogether balk
868	The prey wherein by nature they delight;
869	So surfeit-taking Tarquin fares this night:
870	His taste delicious, in digestion souring,
871	Devours his will, that lived by foul devouring.
872	
873	O, deeper sin than bottomless conceit
874	Can comprehend in still imagination!
875	Drunken Desire must vomit his receipt,
876	Ere he can see his own abomination.
877	While Lust is in his pride, no exclamation
878	Can curb his heat or rein his rash desire,
879	Till like a jade Self-will himself doth tire.
880	
881	And then with lank and lean discolour'd cheek,
882	With heavy eye, knit brow, and strengthless pace,
883	Feeble Desire, all recreant, poor, and meek,
884	Like to a bankrupt beggar wails his case:
885	The flesh being proud, Desire doth fight with Grace,
886	For there it revels; and when that decays,
887	The guilty rebel for remission prays.
888	
889	So fares it with this faultful lord of Rome,
890	Who this accomplishment so hotly chased;
891	For now against himself he sounds this doom,
892	That through the length of times he stands disgraced:
893	Besides, his soul's fair temple is defaced;
894	To whose weak ruins muster troops of cares,
895	To ask the spotted princess how she fares.
896	
897	She says, her subjects with foul insurrection
898	Have batter'd down her consecrated wall,
899	And by their mortal fault brought in subjection
900	Her immortality, and made her thrall
901	To living death and pain perpetual:
902	Which in her prescience she controlled still,
903	But her foresight could not forestall their will.
904	
905	Even in this thought through the dark night he stealeth,
906	A captive victor that hath lost in gain;
907	Bearing away the wound that nothing healeth,
908	The scar that will, despite of cure, remain;
909	Leaving his spoil perplex'd in greater pain.
910	She bears the load of lust he left behind,
911	And he the burden of a guilty mind.
912	
913	He like a thievish dog creeps sadly thence;
914	She like a wearied lamb lies panting there;
915	He scowls and hates himself for his offence;
916	She, desperate, with her nails her flesh doth tear;
917	He faintly flies, sneaking with guilty fear;
918	She stays, exclaiming on the direful night;
919	He runs, and chides his vanish'd, loathed delight.
920	
921	He thence departs a heavy convertite;
922	She there remains a hopeless castaway;
923	He in his speed looks for the morning light;
924	She prays she never may behold the day,
925	'For day,' quoth she, 'nights scapes doth open lay,
926	And my true eyes have never practised how
927	To cloak offences with a cunning brow.
928	
929	'They think not but that every eye can see
930	The same disgrace which they themselves behold;
931	And therefore would they still in darkness be,
932	To have their unseen sin remain untold;
933	For they their guilt with weeping will unfold,
934	And grave, like water that doth eat in steel,
935	Upon my cheeks what helpless shame I feel.'
936	
937	Here she exclaims against repose and rest,
938	And bids her eyes hereafter still be blind.
939	She wakes her heart by beating on her breast,
940	And bids it leap from thence, where it may find
941	Some purer chest to close so pure a mind.
942	Frantic with grief thus breathes she forth her spite
943	Against the unseen secrecy of night:
944	
945	'O comfort-killing Night, image of hell!
946	Dim register and notary of shame!
947	Black stage for tragedies and murders fell!
948	Vast sin-concealing chaos! nurse of blame!
949	Blind muffled bawd! dark harbour for defame!
950	Grim cave of death! whispering conspirator
951	With close-tongued treason and the ravisher!
952	
953	'O hateful, vaporous, and foggy Night!
954	Since thou art guilty of my cureless crime,
955	Muster thy mists to meet the eastern light,
956	Make war against proportion'd course of time;
957	Or if thou wilt permit the sun to climb
958	His wonted height, yet ere he go to bed,
959	Knit poisonous clouds about his golden head.
960	
961	'With rotten damps ravish the morning air;
962	Let their exhaled unwholesome breaths make sick
963	The life of purity, the supreme fair,
964	Ere he arrive his weary noon-tide prick;
965	And let thy misty vapours march so thick,
966	That in their smoky ranks his smother'd light
967	May set at noon and make perpetual night.
968	
969	'Were Tarquin Night, as he is but Night's child,
970	The silver-shining queen he would distain;
971	Her twinkling handmaids too, by him defiled,
972	Through Night's black bosom should not peep again:
973	So should I have co-partners in my pain;
974	And fellowship in woe doth woe assuage,
975	As palmers' chat makes short their pilgrimage.
976	
977	'Where now I have no one to blush with me,
978	To cross their arms and hang their heads with mine,
979	To mask their brows and hide their infamy;
980	But I alone alone must sit and pine,
981	Seasoning the earth with showers of silver brine,
982	Mingling my talk with tears, my grief with groans,
983	Poor wasting monuments of lasting moans.
984	
985	'O Night, thou furnace of foul-reeking smoke,
986	Let not the jealous Day behold that face
987	Which underneath thy black all-hiding cloak
988	Immodestly lies martyr'd with disgrace!
989	Keep still possession of thy gloomy place,
990	That all the faults which in thy reign are made
991	May likewise be sepulchred in thy shade!
992	
993	'Make me not object to the tell-tale Day!
994	The light will show, character'd in my brow,
995	The story of sweet chastity's decay,
996	The impious breach of holy wedlock vow:
997	Yea the illiterate, that know not how
998	To cipher what is writ in learned books,
999	Will quote my loathsome trespass in my looks.
1000	
1001	'The nurse, to still her child, will tell my story,
1002	And fright her crying babe with Tarquin's name;
1003	The orator, to deck his oratory,
1004	Will couple my reproach to Tarquin's shame;
1005	Feast-finding minstrels, tuning my defame,
1006	Will tie the hearers to attend each line,
1007	How Tarquin wronged me, I Collatine.
1008	
1009	'Let my good name, that senseless reputation,
1010	For Collatine's dear love be kept unspotted:
1011	If that be made a theme for disputation,
1012	The branches of another root are rotted,
1013	And undeserved reproach to him allotted
1014	That is as clear from this attaint of mine
1015	As I, ere this, was pure to Collatine.
1016	
1017	'O unseen shame! invisible disgrace!
1018	O unfelt sore! crest-wounding, private scar!
1019	Reproach is stamp'd in Collatinus' face,
1020	And Tarquin's eye may read the mot afar,
1021	How he in peace is wounded, not in war.
1022	Alas, how many bear such shameful blows,
1023	Which not themselves, but he that gives them knows!
1024	
1025	'If, Collatine, thine honour lay in me,
1026	From me by strong assault it is bereft.
1027	My honour lost, and I, a drone-like bee,
1028	Have no perfection of my summer left,
1029	But robb'd and ransack'd by injurious theft:
1030	In thy weak hive a wandering wasp hath crept,
1031	And suck'd the honey which thy chaste bee kept.
1032	
1033	'Yet am I guilty of thy honour's wrack;
1034	Yet for thy honour did I entertain him;
1035	Coming from thee, I could not put him back,
1036	For it had been dishonour to disdain him:
1037	Besides, of weariness he did complain him,
1038	And talk'd of virtue: O unlook'd-for evil,
1039	When virtue is profaned in such a devil!
1040	
1041	'Why should the worm intrude the maiden bud?
1042	Or hateful cuckoos hatch in sparrows' nests?
1043	Or toads infect fair founts with venom mud?
1044	Or tyrant folly lurk in gentle breasts?
1045	Or kings be breakers of their own behests?
1046	But no perfection is so absolute,
1047	That some impurity doth not pollute.
1048	
1049	'The aged man that coffers-up his gold
1050	Is plagued with cramps and gouts and painful fits;
1051	And scarce hath eyes his treasure to behold,
1052	But like still-pining Tantalus he sits,
1053	And useless barns the harvest of his wits;
1054	Having no other pleasure of his gain
1055	But torment that it cannot cure his pain.
1056	
1057	'So then he hath it when he cannot use it,
1058	And leaves it to be master'd by his young;
1059	Who in their pride do presently abuse it:
1060	Their father was too weak, and they too strong,
1061	To hold their cursed-blessed fortune long.
1062	The sweets we wish for turn to loathed sours
1063	Even in the moment that we call them ours.
1064	
1065	'Unruly blasts wait on the tender spring;
1066	Unwholesome weeds take root with precious flowers;
1067	The adder hisses where the sweet birds sing;
1068	What virtue breeds iniquity devours:
1069	We have no good that we can say is ours,
1070	But ill-annexed Opportunity
1071	Or kills his life or else his quality.
1072	
1073	'O Opportunity, thy guilt is great!
1074	'Tis thou that executest the traitor's treason:
1075	Thou set'st the wolf where he the lamb may get;
1076	Whoever plots the sin, thou 'point'st the season;
1077	'Tis thou that spurn'st at right, at law, at reason;
1078	And in thy shady cell, where none may spy him,
1079	Sits Sin, to seize the souls that wander by him.
1080	
1081	'Thou makest the vestal violate her oath;
1082	Thou blow'st the fire when temperance is thaw'd;
1083	Thou smother'st honesty, thou murder'st troth;
1084	Thou foul abettor! thou notorious bawd!
1085	Thou plantest scandal and displacest laud:
1086	Thou ravisher, thou traitor, thou false thief,
1087	Thy honey turns to gall, thy joy to grief!
1088	
1089	'Thy secret pleasure turns to open shame,
1090	Thy private feasting to a public fast,
1091	Thy smoothing titles to a ragged name,
1092	Thy sugar'd tongue to bitter wormwood taste:
1093	Thy violent vanities can never last.
1094	How comes it then, vile Opportunity,
1095	Being so bad, such numbers seek for thee?
1096	
1097	'When wilt thou be the humble suppliant's friend,
1098	And bring him where his suit may be obtain'd?
1099	When wilt thou sort an hour great strifes to end?
1100	Or free that soul which wretchedness hath chain'd?
1101	Give physic to the sick, ease to the pain'd?
1102	The poor, lame, blind, halt, creep, cry out for thee;
1103	But they ne'er meet with Opportunity.
1104	
1105	'The patient dies while the physician sleeps;
1106	The orphan pines while the oppressor feeds;
1107	Justice is feasting while the widow weeps;
1108	Advice is sporting while infection breeds:
1109	Thou grant'st no time for charitable deeds:
1110	Wrath, envy, treason, rape, and murder's rages,
1111	Thy heinous hours wait on them as their pages.
1112	
1113	'When Truth and Virtue have to do with thee,
1114	A thousand crosses keep them from thy aid:
1115	They buy thy help; but Sin ne'er gives a fee,
1116	He gratis comes; and thou art well appaid
1117	As well to hear as grant what he hath said.
1118	My Collatine would else have come to me
1119	When Tarquin did, but he was stay'd by thee.
1120	
1121	Guilty thou art of murder and of theft,
1122	Guilty of perjury and subornation,
1123	Guilty of treason, forgery, and shift,
1124	Guilty of incest, that abomination;
1125	An accessary by thine inclination
1126	To all sins past, and all that are to come,
1127	From the creation to the general doom.
1128	
1129	'Mis-shapen Time, copesmate of ugly Night,
1130	Swift subtle post, carrier of grisly care,
1131	Eater of youth, false slave to false delight,
1132	Base watch of woes, sin's pack-horse, virtue's snare;
1133	Thou nursest all and murder'st all that are:
1134	O, hear me then, injurious, shifting Time!
1135	Be guilty of my death, since of my crime.
1136	
1137	'Why hath thy servant, Opportunity,
1138	Betray'd the hours thou gavest me to repose,
1139	Cancell'd my fortunes, and enchained me
1140	To endless date of never-ending woes?
1141	Time's office is to fine the hate of foes;
1142	To eat up errors by opinion bred,
1143	Not spend the dowry of a lawful bed.
1144	
1145	'Time's glory is to calm contending kings,
1146	To unmask falsehood and bring truth to light,
1147	To stamp the seal of time in aged things,
1148	To wake the morn and sentinel the night,
1149	To wrong the wronger till he render right,
1150	To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours,
1151	And smear with dust their glittering golden towers;
1152	
1153	'To fill with worm-holes stately monuments,
1154	To feed oblivion with decay of things,
1155	To blot old books and alter their contents,
1156	To pluck the quills from ancient ravens' wings,
1157	To dry the old oak's sap and cherish springs,
1158	To spoil antiquities of hammer'd steel,
1159	And turn the giddy round of Fortune's wheel;
1160	
1161	'To show the beldam daughters of her daughter,
1162	To make the child a man, the man a child,
1163	To slay the tiger that doth live by slaughter,
1164	To tame the unicorn and lion wild,
1165	To mock the subtle in themselves beguiled,
1166	To cheer the ploughman with increaseful crops,
1167	And waste huge stones with little water drops.
1168	
1169	'Why work'st thou mischief in thy pilgrimage,
1170	Unless thou couldst return to make amends?
1171	One poor retiring minute in an age
1172	Would purchase thee a thousand thousand friends,
1173	Lending him wit that to bad debtors lends:
1174	O, this dread night, wouldst thou one hour come back,
1175	I could prevent this storm and shun thy wrack!
1176	
1177	'Thou ceaseless lackey to eternity,
1178	With some mischance cross Tarquin in his flight:
1179	Devise extremes beyond extremity,
1180	To make him curse this cursed crimeful night:
1181	Let ghastly shadows his lewd eyes affright;
1182	And the dire thought of his committed evil
1183	Shape every bush a hideous shapeless devil.
1184	
1185	'Disturb his hours of rest with restless trances,
1186	Afflict him in his bed with bedrid groans;
1187	Let there bechance him pitiful mischances,
1188	To make him moan; but pity not his moans:
1189	Stone him with harden'd hearts harder than stones;
1190	And let mild women to him lose their mildness,
1191	Wilder to him than tigers in their wildness.
1192	
1193	'Let him have time to tear his curled hair,
1194	Let him have time against himself to rave,
1195	Let him have time of Time's help to despair,
1196	Let him have time to live a loathed slave,
1197	Let him have time a beggar's orts to crave,
1198	And time to see one that by alms doth live
1199	Disdain to him disdained scraps to give.
1200	
1201	'Let him have time to see his friends his foes,
1202	And merry fools to mock at him resort;
1203	Let him have time to mark how slow time goes
1204	In time of sorrow, and how swift and short
1205	His time of folly and his time of sport;
1206	And ever let his unrecalling crime
1207	Have time to wail th' abusing of his time.
1208	
1209	'O Time, thou tutor both to good and bad,
1210	Teach me to curse him that thou taught'st this ill!
1211	At his own shadow let the thief run mad,
1212	Himself himself seek every hour to kill!
1213	Such wretched hands such wretched blood should spill;
1214	For who so base would such an office have
1215	As slanderous death's-man to so base a slave?
1216	
1217	'The baser is he, coming from a king,
1218	To shame his hope with deeds degenerate:
1219	The mightier man, the mightier is the thing
1220	That makes him honour'd, or begets him hate;
1221	For greatest scandal waits on greatest state.
1222	The moon being clouded presently is miss'd,
1223	But little stars may hide them when they list.
1224	
1225	'The crow may bathe his coal-black wings in mire,
1226	And unperceived fly with the filth away;
1227	But if the like the snow-white swan desire,
1228	The stain upon his silver down will stay.
1229	Poor grooms are sightless night, kings glorious day:
1230	Gnats are unnoted wheresoe'er they fly,
1231	But eagles gazed upon with every eye.
1232	
1233	'Out, idle words, servants to shallow fools!
1234	Unprofitable sounds, weak arbitrators!
1235	Busy yourselves in skill-contending schools;
1236	Debate where leisure serves with dull debaters;
1237	To trembling clients be you mediators:
1238	For me, I force not argument a straw,
1239	Since that my case is past the help of law.
1240	
1241	'In vain I rail at Opportunity,
1242	At Time, at Tarquin, and uncheerful Night;
1243	In vain I cavil with mine infamy,
1244	In vain I spurn at my confirm'd despite:
1245	This helpless smoke of words doth me no right.
1246	The remedy indeed to do me good
1247	Is to let forth my foul-defiled blood.
1248	
1249	'Poor hand, why quiver'st thou at this decree?
1250	Honour thyself to rid me of this shame:
1251	For if I die, my honour lives in thee;
1252	But if I live, thou livest in my defame:
1253	Since thou couldst not defend thy loyal dame,
1254	And wast afeard to scratch her wicked foe,
1255	Kill both thyself and her for yielding so.'
1256	
1257	This said, from her be-tumbled couch she starteth,
1258	To find some desperate instrument of death:
1259	But this no slaughterhouse no tool imparteth
1260	To make more vent for passage of her breath;
1261	Which, thronging through her lips, so vanisheth
1262	As smoke from AEtna, that in air consumes,
1263	Or that which from discharged cannon fumes.
1264	
1265	'In vain,' quoth she, 'I live, and seek in vain
1266	Some happy mean to end a hapless life.
1267	I fear'd by Tarquin's falchion to be slain,
1268	Yet for the self-same purpose seek a knife:
1269	But when I fear'd I was a loyal wife:
1270	So am I now: O no, that cannot be;
1271	Of that true type hath Tarquin rifled me.
1272	
1273	'O, that is gone for which I sought to live,
1274	And therefore now I need not fear to die.
1275	To clear this spot by death, at least I give
1276	A badge of fame to slander's livery;
1277	A dying life to living infamy:
1278	Poor helpless help, the treasure stol'n away,
1279	To burn the guiltless casket where it lay!
1280	
1281	'Well, well, dear Collatine, thou shalt not know
1282	The stained taste of violated troth;
1283	I will not wrong thy true affection so,
1284	To flatter thee with an infringed oath;
1285	This bastard graff shall never come to growth:
1286	He shall not boast who did thy stock pollute
1287	That thou art doting father of his fruit.
1288	
1289	'Nor shall he smile at thee in secret thought,
1290	Nor laugh with his companions at thy state:
1291	But thou shalt know thy interest was not bought
1292	Basely with gold, but stol'n from forth thy gate.
1293	For me, I am the mistress of my fate,
1294	And with my trespass never will dispense,
1295	Till life to death acquit my forced offence.
1296	
1297	'I will not poison thee with my attaint,
1298	Nor fold my fault in cleanly-coin'd excuses;
1299	My sable ground of sin I will not paint,
1300	To hide the truth of this false night's abuses:
1301	My tongue shall utter all; mine eyes, like sluices,
1302	As from a mountain-spring that feeds a dale,
1303	Shall gush pure streams to purge my impure tale.'
1304	
1305	By this, lamenting Philomel had ended
1306	The well-tuned warble of her nightly sorrow,
1307	And solemn night with slow sad gait descended
1308	To ugly hell; when, lo, the blushing morrow
1309	Lends light to all fair eyes that light will borrow:
1310	But cloudy Lucrece shames herself to see,
1311	And therefore still in night would cloister'd be.
1312	
1313	Revealing day through every cranny spies,
1314	And seems to point her out where she sits weeping;
1315	To whom she sobbing speaks: 'O eye of eyes,
1316	Why pry'st thou through my window? leave thy peeping:
1317	Mock with thy tickling beams eyes that are sleeping:
1318	Brand not my forehead with thy piercing light,
1319	For day hath nought to do what's done by night.'
1320	
1321	Thus cavils she with every thing she sees:
1322	True grief is fond and testy as a child,
1323	Who wayward once, his mood with nought agrees:
1324	Old woes, not infant sorrows, bear them mild;
1325	Continuance tames the one; the other wild,
1326	Like an unpractised swimmer plunging still,
1327	With too much labour drowns for want of skill.
1328	
1329	So she, deep-drenched in a sea of care,
1330	Holds disputation with each thing she views,
1331	And to herself all sorrow doth compare;
1332	No object but her passion's strength renews;
1333	And as one shifts, another straight ensues:
1334	Sometime her grief is dumb and hath no words;
1335	Sometime 'tis mad and too much talk affords.
1336	
1337	The little birds that tune their morning's joy
1338	Make her moans mad with their sweet melody:
1339	For mirth doth search the bottom of annoy;
1340	Sad souls are slain in merry company;
1341	Grief best is pleased with grief's society:
1342	True sorrow then is feelingly sufficed
1343	When with like semblance it is sympathized.
1344	
1345	'Tis double death to drown in ken of shore;
1346	He ten times pines that pines beholding food;
1347	To see the salve doth make the wound ache more;
1348	Great grief grieves most at that would do it good;
1349	Deep woes roll forward like a gentle flood,
1350	Who being stopp'd, the bounding banks o'erflows;
1351	Grief dallied with nor law nor limit knows.
1352	
1353	'You mocking-birds,' quoth she, 'your tunes entomb
1354	Within your hollow-swelling feather'd breasts,
1355	And in my hearing be you mute and dumb:
1356	My restless discord loves no stops nor rests;
1357	A woeful hostess brooks not merry guests:
1358	Relish your nimble notes to pleasing ears;
1359	Distress likes dumps when time is kept with tears.
1360	
1361	'Come, Philomel, that sing'st of ravishment,
1362	Make thy sad grove in my dishevell'd hair:
1363	As the dank earth weeps at thy languishment,
1364	So I at each sad strain will strain a tear,
1365	And with deep groans the diapason bear;
1366	For burden-wise I'll hum on Tarquin still,
1367	While thou on Tereus descant'st better skill.
1368	
1369	'And whiles against a thorn thou bear'st thy part,
1370	To keep thy sharp woes waking, wretched I,
1371	To imitate thee well, against my heart
1372	Will fix a sharp knife to affright mine eye;
1373	Who, if it wink, shall thereon fall and die.
1374	These means, as frets upon an instrument,
1375	Shall tune our heart-strings to true languishment.
1376	
1377	'And for, poor bird, thou sing'st not in the day,
1378	As shaming any eye should thee behold,
1379	Some dark deep desert, seated from the way,
1380	That knows not parching heat nor freezing cold,
1381	Will we find out; and there we will unfold
1382	To creatures stern sad tunes, to change their kinds:
1383	Since men prove beasts, let beasts bear gentle minds.'
1384	
1385	As the poor frighted deer, that stands at gaze,
1386	Wildly determining which way to fly,
1387	Or one encompass'd with a winding maze,
1388	That cannot tread the way out readily;
1389	So with herself is she in mutiny,
1390	To live or die which of the twain were better,
1391	When life is shamed, and death reproach's debtor.
1392	
1393	'To kill myself,' quoth she, 'alack, what were it,
1394	But with my body my poor soul's pollution?
1395	They that lose half with greater patience bear it
1396	Than they whose whole is swallow'd in confusion.
1397	That mother tries a merciless conclusion
1398	Who, having two sweet babes, when death takes one,
1399	Will slay the other and be nurse to none.
1400	
1401	'My body or my soul, which was the dearer,
1402	When the one pure, the other made divine?
1403	Whose love of either to myself was nearer,
1404	When both were kept for heaven and Collatine?
1405	Ay me! the bark peel'd from the lofty pine,
1406	His leaves will wither and his sap decay;
1407	So must my soul, her bark being peel'd away.
1408	
1409	'Her house is sack'd, her quiet interrupted,
1410	Her mansion batter'd by the enemy;
1411	Her sacred temple spotted, spoil'd, corrupted,
1412	Grossly engirt with daring infamy:
1413	Then let it not be call'd impiety,
1414	If in this blemish'd fort I make some hole
1415	Through which I may convey this troubled soul.
1416	
1417	'Yet die I will not till my Collatine
1418	Have heard the cause of my untimely death;
1419	That he may vow, in that sad hour of mine,
1420	Revenge on him that made me stop my breath.
1421	My stained blood to Tarquin I'll bequeath,
1422	Which by him tainted shall for him be spent,
1423	And as his due writ in my testament.
1424	
1425	'My honour I'll bequeath unto the knife
1426	That wounds my body so dishonoured.
1427	'Tis honour to deprive dishonour'd life;
1428	The one will live, the other being dead:
1429	So of shame's ashes shall my fame be bred;
1430	For in my death I murder shameful scorn:
1431	My shame so dead, mine honour is new-born.
1432	
1433	'Dear lord of that dear jewel I have lost,
1434	What legacy shall I bequeath to thee?
1435	My resolution, love, shall be thy boast,
1436	By whose example thou revenged mayest be.
1437	How Tarquin must be used, read it in me:
1438	Myself, thy friend, will kill myself, thy foe,
1439	And for my sake serve thou false Tarquin so.
1440	
1441	'This brief abridgement of my will I make:
1442	My soul and body to the skies and ground;
1443	My resolution, husband, do thou take;
1444	Mine honour be the knife's that makes my wound;
1445	My shame be his that did my fame confound;
1446	And all my fame that lives disbursed be
1447	To those that live, and think no shame of me.
1448	
1449	'Thou, Collatine, shalt oversee this will;
1450	How was I overseen that thou shalt see it!
1451	My blood shall wash the slander of mine ill;
1452	My life's foul deed, my life's fair end shall free it.
1453	Faint not, faint heart, but stoutly say 'So be it:'
1454	Yield to my hand; my hand shall conquer thee:
1455	Thou dead, both die, and both shall victors be.'
1456	
1457	This Plot of death when sadly she had laid,
1458	And wiped the brinish pearl from her bright eyes,
1459	With untuned tongue she hoarsely calls her maid,
1460	Whose swift obedience to her mistress hies;
1461	For fleet-wing'd duty with thought's feathers flies.
1462	Poor Lucrece' cheeks unto her maid seem so
1463	As winter meads when sun doth melt their snow.
1464	
1465	Her mistress she doth give demure good-morrow,
1466	With soft-slow tongue, true mark of modesty,
1467	And sorts a sad look to her lady's sorrow,
1468	For why her face wore sorrow's livery;
1469	But durst not ask of her audaciously
1470	Why her two suns were cloud-eclipsed so,
1471	Nor why her fair cheeks over-wash'd with woe.
1472	
1473	But as the earth doth weep, the sun being set,
1474	Each flower moisten'd like a melting eye;
1475	Even so the maid with swelling drops gan wet
1476	Her circled eyne, enforced by sympathy
1477	Of those fair suns set in her mistress' sky,
1478	Who in a salt-waved ocean quench their light,
1479	Which makes the maid weep like the dewy night.
1480	
1481	A pretty while these pretty creatures stand,
1482	Like ivory conduits coral cisterns filling:
1483	One justly weeps; the other takes in hand
1484	No cause, but company, of her drops spilling:
1485	Their gentle sex to weep are often willing;
1486	Grieving themselves to guess at others' smarts,
1487	And then they drown their eyes or break their hearts.
1488	
1489	For men have marble, women waxen, minds,
1490	And therefore are they form'd as marble will;
1491	The weak oppress'd, the impression of strange kinds
1492	Is form'd in them by force, by fraud, or skill:
1493	Then call them not the authors of their ill,
1494	No more than wax shall be accounted evil
1495	Wherein is stamp'd the semblance of a devil.
1496	
1497	Their smoothness, like a goodly champaign plain,
1498	Lays open all the little worms that creep;
1499	In men, as in a rough-grown grove, remain
1500	Cave-keeping evils that obscurely sleep:
1501	Through crystal walls each little mote will peep:
1502	Though men can cover crimes with bold stern looks,
1503	Poor women's faces are their own fault's books.
1504	
1505	No man inveigh against the wither'd flower,
1506	But chide rough winter that the flower hath kill'd:
1507	Not that devour'd, but that which doth devour,
1508	Is worthy blame. O, let it not be hild
1509	Poor women's faults, that they are so fulfill'd
1510	With men's abuses: those proud lords, to blame,
1511	Make weak-made women tenants to their shame.
1512	
1513	The precedent whereof in Lucrece view,
1514	Assail'd by night with circumstances strong
1515	Of present death, and shame that might ensue
1516	By that her death, to do her husband wrong:
1517	Such danger to resistance did belong,
1518	That dying fear through all her body spread;
1519	And who cannot abuse a body dead?
1520	
1521	By this, mild patience bid fair Lucrece speak
1522	To the poor counterfeit of her complaining:
1523	'My girl,' quoth she, 'on what occasion break
1524	Those tears from thee, that down thy cheeks are
1525	raining?
1526	If thou dost weep for grief of my sustaining,
1527	Know, gentle wench, it small avails my mood:
1528	If tears could help, mine own would do me good.
1529	
1530	'But tell me, girl, when went'--and there she stay'd
1531	Till after a deep groan--'Tarquin from hence?'
1532	'Madam, ere I was up,' replied the maid,
1533	'The more to blame my sluggard negligence:
1534	Yet with the fault I thus far can dispense;
1535	Myself was stirring ere the break of day,
1536	And, ere I rose, was Tarquin gone away.
1537	
1538	'But, lady, if your maid may be so bold,
1539	She would request to know your heaviness.'
1540	'O, peace!' quoth Lucrece: 'if it should be told,
1541	The repetition cannot make it less;
1542	For more it is than I can well express:
1543	And that deep torture may be call'd a hell
1544	When more is felt than one hath power to tell.
1545	
1546	'Go, get me hither paper, ink, and pen:
1547	Yet save that labour, for I have them here.
1548	What should I say? One of my husband's men
1549	Bid thou be ready, by and by, to bear
1550	A letter to my lord, my love, my dear;
1551	Bid him with speed prepare to carry it;
1552	The cause craves haste, and it will soon be writ.'
1553	
1554	Her maid is gone, and she prepares to write,
1555	First hovering o'er the paper with her quill:
1556	Conceit and grief an eager combat fight;
1557	What wit sets down is blotted straight with will;
1558	This is too curious-good, this blunt and ill:
1559	Much like a press of people at a door,
1560	Throng her inventions, which shall go before.
1561	
1562	At last she thus begins: 'Thou worthy lord
1563	Of that unworthy wife that greeteth thee,
1564	Health to thy person! next vouchsafe t' afford--
1565	If ever, love, thy Lucrece thou wilt see--
1566	Some present speed to come and visit me.
1567	So, I commend me from our house in grief:
1568	My woes are tedious, though my words are brief.'
1569	
1570	Here folds she up the tenor of her woe,
1571	Her certain sorrow writ uncertainly.
1572	By this short schedule Collatine may know
1573	Her grief, but not her grief's true quality:
1574	She dares not thereof make discovery,
1575	Lest he should hold it her own gross abuse,
1576	Ere she with blood had stain'd her stain'd excuse.
1577	
1578	Besides, the life and feeling of her passion
1579	She hoards, to spend when he is by to hear her:
1580	When sighs and groans and tears may grace the fashion
1581	Of her disgrace, the better so to clear her
1582	From that suspicion which the world might bear her.
1583	To shun this blot, she would not blot the letter
1584	With words, till action might become them better.
1585	
1586	To see sad sights moves more than hear them told;
1587	For then eye interprets to the ear
1588	The heavy motion that it doth behold,
1589	When every part a part of woe doth bear.
1590	'Tis but a part of sorrow that we hear:
1591	Deep sounds make lesser noise than shallow fords,
1592	And sorrow ebbs, being blown with wind of words.
1593	
1594	Her letter now is seal'd, and on it writ
1595	'At Ardea to my lord with more than haste.'
1596	The post attends, and she delivers it,
1597	Charging the sour-faced groom to hie as fast
1598	As lagging fowls before the northern blast:
1599	Speed more than speed but dull and slow she deems:
1600	Extremity still urgeth such extremes.
1601	
1602	The homely villain court'sies to her low;
1603	And, blushing on her, with a steadfast eye
1604	Receives the scroll without or yea or no,
1605	And forth with bashful innocence doth hie.
1606	But they whose guilt within their bosoms lie
1607	Imagine every eye beholds their blame;
1608	For Lucrece thought he blush'd to her see shame:
1609	
1610	When, silly groom! God wot, it was defect
1611	Of spirit, Life, and bold audacity.
1612	Such harmless creatures have a true respect
1613	To talk in deeds, while others saucily
1614	Promise more speed, but do it leisurely:
1615	Even so this pattern of the worn-out age
1616	Pawn'd honest looks, but laid no words to gage.
1617	
1618	His kindled duty kindled her mistrust,
1619	That two red fires in both their faces blazed;
1620	She thought he blush'd, as knowing Tarquin's lust,
1621	And, blushing with him, wistly on him gazed;
1622	Her earnest eye did make him more amazed:
1623	The more she saw the blood his cheeks replenish,
1624	The more she thought he spied in her some blemish.
1625	
1626	But long she thinks till he return again,
1627	And yet the duteous vassal scarce is gone.
1628	The weary time she cannot entertain,
1629	For now 'tis stale to sigh, to weep, and groan:
1630	So woe hath wearied woe, moan tired moan,
1631	That she her plaints a little while doth stay,
1632	Pausing for means to mourn some newer way.
1633	
1634	At last she calls to mind where hangs a piece
1635	Of skilful painting, made for Priam's Troy:
1636	Before the which is drawn the power of Greece.
1637	For Helen's rape the city to destroy,
1638	Threatening cloud-kissing Ilion with annoy;
1639	Which the conceited painter drew so proud,
1640	As heaven, it seem'd, to kiss the turrets bow'd.
1641	
1642	A thousand lamentable objects there,
1643	In scorn of nature, art gave lifeless life:
1644	Many a dry drop seem'd a weeping tear,
1645	Shed for the slaughter'd husband by the wife:
1646	The red blood reek'd, to show the painter's strife;
1647	And dying eyes gleam'd forth their ashy lights,
1648	Like dying coals burnt out in tedious nights.
1649	
1650	There might you see the labouring pioner
1651	Begrimed with sweat, and smeared all with dust;
1652	And from the towers of Troy there would appear
1653	The very eyes of men through loop-holes thrust,
1654	Gazing upon the Greeks with little lust:
1655	Such sweet observance in this work was had,
1656	That one might see those far-off eyes look sad.
1657	
1658	In great commanders grace and majesty
1659	You might behold, triumphing in their faces;
1660	In youth, quick bearing and dexterity;
1661	Pale cowards, marching on with trembling paces;
1662	Which heartless peasants did so well resemble,
1663	That one would swear he saw them quake and tremble.
1664	
1665	In Ajax and Ulysses, O, what art
1666	Of physiognomy might one behold!
1667	The face of either cipher'd either's heart;
1668	Their face their manners most expressly told:
1669	In Ajax' eyes blunt rage and rigor roll'd;
1670	But the mild glance that sly Ulysses lent
1671	Show'd deep regard and smiling government.
1672	
1673	There pleading might you see grave Nestor stand,
1674	As 'twere encouraging the Greeks to fight;
1675	Making such sober action with his hand,
1676	That it beguiled attention, charm'd the sight:
1677	In speech, it seem'd, his beard, all silver white,
1678	Wagg'd up and down, and from his lips did fly
1679	Thin winding breath, which purl'd up to the sky.
1680	
1681	About him were a press of gaping faces,
1682	Which seem'd to swallow up his sound advice;
1683	All jointly listening, but with several graces,
1684	As if some mermaid did their ears entice,
1685	Some high, some low, the painter was so nice;
1686	The scalps of many, almost hid behind,
1687	To jump up higher seem'd, to mock the mind.
1688	
1689	Here one man's hand lean'd on another's head,
1690	His nose being shadow'd by his neighbour's ear;
1691	Here one being throng'd bears back, all boll'n and
1692	red;
1693	Another smother'd seems to pelt and swear;
1694	And in their rage such signs of rage they bear,
1695	As, but for loss of Nestor's golden words,
1696	It seem'd they would debate with angry swords.
1697	
1698	For much imaginary work was there;
1699	Conceit deceitful, so compact, so kind,
1700	That for Achilles' image stood his spear,
1701	Griped in an armed hand; himself, behind,
1702	Was left unseen, save to the eye of mind:
1703	A hand, a foot, a face, a leg, a head,
1704	Stood for the whole to be imagined.
1705	
1706	And from the walls of strong-besieged Troy
1707	When their brave hope, bold Hector, march'd to
1708	field,
1709	Stood many Trojan mothers, sharing joy
1710	To see their youthful sons bright weapons wield;
1711	And to their hope they such odd action yield,
1712	That through their light joy seemed to appear,
1713	Like bright things stain'd, a kind of heavy fear.
1714	
1715	And from the strand of Dardan, where they fought,
1716	To Simois' reedy banks the red blood ran,
1717	Whose waves to imitate the battle sought
1718	With swelling ridges; and their ranks began
1719	To break upon the galled shore, and than
1720	Retire again, till, meeting greater ranks,
1721	They join and shoot their foam at Simois' banks.
1722	
1723	To this well-painted piece is Lucrece come,
1724	To find a face where all distress is stell'd.
1725	Many she sees where cares have carved some,
1726	But none where all distress and dolour dwell'd,
1727	Till she despairing Hecuba beheld,
1728	Staring on Priam's wounds with her old eyes,
1729	Which bleeding under Pyrrhus' proud foot lies.
1730	
1731	In her the painter had anatomized
1732	Time's ruin, beauty's wreck, and grim care's reign:
1733	Her cheeks with chaps and wrinkles were disguised;
1734	Of what she was no semblance did remain:
1735	Her blue blood changed to black in every vein,
1736	Wanting the spring that those shrunk pipes had fed,
1737	Show'd life imprison'd in a body dead.
1738	
1739	On this sad shadow Lucrece spends her eyes,
1740	And shapes her sorrow to the beldam's woes,
1741	Who nothing wants to answer her but cries,
1742	And bitter words to ban her cruel foes:
1743	The painter was no god to lend her those;
1744	And therefore Lucrece swears he did her wrong,
1745	To give her so much grief and not a tongue.
1746	
1747	'Poor instrument,' quoth she,'without a sound,
1748	I'll tune thy woes with my lamenting tongue;
1749	And drop sweet balm in Priam's painted wound,
1750	And rail on Pyrrhus that hath done him wrong;
1751	And with my tears quench Troy that burns so long;
1752	And with my knife scratch out the angry eyes
1753	Of all the Greeks that are thine enemies.
1754	
1755	'Show me the strumpet that began this stir,
1756	That with my nails her beauty I may tear.
1757	Thy heat of lust, fond Paris, did incur
1758	This load of wrath that burning Troy doth bear:
1759	Thy eye kindled the fire that burneth here;
1760	And here in Troy, for trespass of thine eye,
1761	The sire, the son, the dame, and daughter die.
1762	
1763	'Why should the private pleasure of some one
1764	Become the public plague of many moe?
1765	Let sin, alone committed, light alone
1766	Upon his head that hath transgressed so;
1767	Let guiltless souls be freed from guilty woe:
1768	For one's offence why should so many fall,
1769	To plague a private sin in general?
1770	
1771	'Lo, here weeps Hecuba, here Priam dies,
1772	Here manly Hector faints, here Troilus swounds,
1773	Here friend by friend in bloody channel lies,
1774	And friend to friend gives unadvised wounds,
1775	And one man's lust these many lives confounds:
1776	Had doting Priam cheque'd his son's desire,
1777	Troy had been bright with fame and not with fire.'
1778	
1779	Here feelingly she weeps Troy's painted woes:
1780	For sorrow, like a heavy-hanging bell,
1781	Once set on ringing, with his own weight goes;
1782	Then little strength rings out the doleful knell:
1783	So Lucrece, set a-work, sad tales doth tell
1784	To pencill'd pensiveness and colour'd sorrow;
1785	She lends them words, and she their looks doth borrow.
1786	
1787	She throws her eyes about the painting round,
1788	And whom she finds forlorn she doth lament.
1789	At last she sees a wretched image bound,
1790	That piteous looks to Phrygian shepherds lent:
1791	His face, though full of cares, yet show'd content;
1792	Onward to Troy with the blunt swains he goes,
1793	So mild, that Patience seem'd to scorn his woes.
1794	
1795	In him the painter labour'd with his skill
1796	To hide deceit, and give the harmless show
1797	An humble gait, calm looks, eyes wailing still,
1798	A brow unbent, that seem'd to welcome woe;
1799	Cheeks neither red nor pale, but mingled so
1800	That blushing red no guilty instance gave,
1801	Nor ashy pale the fear that false hearts have.
1802	
1803	But, like a constant and confirmed devil,
1804	He entertain'd a show so seeming just,
1805	And therein so ensconced his secret evil,
1806	That jealousy itself could not mistrust
1807	False-creeping craft and perjury should thrust
1808	Into so bright a day such black-faced storms,
1809	Or blot with hell-born sin such saint-like forms.
1810	
1811	The well-skill'd workman this mild image drew
1812	For perjured Sinon, whose enchanting story
1813	The credulous old Priam after slew;
1814	Whose words like wildfire burnt the shining glory
1815	Of rich-built Ilion, that the skies were sorry,
1816	And little stars shot from their fixed places,
1817	When their glass fell wherein they view'd their faces.
1818	
1819	This picture she advisedly perused,
1820	And chid the painter for his wondrous skill,
1821	Saying, some shape in Sinon's was abused;
1822	So fair a form lodged not a mind so ill:
1823	And still on him she gazed; and gazing still,
1824	Such signs of truth in his plain face she spied,
1825	That she concludes the picture was belied.
1826	
1827	'It cannot be,' quoth she,'that so much guile'--
1828	She would have said 'can lurk in such a look;'
1829	But Tarquin's shape came in her mind the while,
1830	And from her tongue 'can lurk' from 'cannot' took:
1831	'It cannot be' she in that sense forsook,
1832	And turn'd it thus,' It cannot be, I find,
1833	But such a face should bear a wicked mind.
1834	
1835	'For even as subtle Sinon here is painted.
1836	So sober-sad, so weary, and so mild,
1837	As if with grief or travail he had fainted,
1838	To me came Tarquin armed; so beguiled
1839	With outward honesty, but yet defiled
1840	With inward vice: as Priam him did cherish,
1841	So did I Tarquin; so my Troy did perish.
1842	
1843	'Look, look, how listening Priam wets his eyes,
1844	To see those borrow'd tears that Sinon sheds!
1845	Priam, why art thou old and yet not wise?
1846	For every tear he falls a Trojan bleeds:
1847	His eye drops fire, no water thence proceeds;
1848	Those round clear pearls of his, that move thy pity,
1849	Are balls of quenchless fire to burn thy city.
1850	
1851	'Such devils steal effects from lightless hell;
1852	For Sinon in his fire doth quake with cold,
1853	And in that cold hot-burning fire doth dwell;
1854	These contraries such unity do hold,
1855	Only to flatter fools and make them bold:
1856	So Priam's trust false Sinon's tears doth flatter,
1857	That he finds means to burn his Troy with water.'
1858	
1859	Here, all enraged, such passion her assails,
1860	That patience is quite beaten from her breast.
1861	She tears the senseless Sinon with her nails,
1862	Comparing him to that unhappy guest
1863	Whose deed hath made herself herself detest:
1864	At last she smilingly with this gives o'er;
1865	'Fool, fool!' quoth she, 'his wounds will not be sore.'
1866	
1867	Thus ebbs and flows the current of her sorrow,
1868	And time doth weary time with her complaining.
1869	She looks for night, and then she longs for morrow,
1870	And both she thinks too long with her remaining:
1871	Short time seems long in sorrow's sharp sustaining:
1872	Though woe be heavy, yet it seldom sleeps,
1873	And they that watch see time how slow it creeps.
1874	
1875	Which all this time hath overslipp'd her thought,
1876	That she with painted images hath spent;
1877	Being from the feeling of her own grief brought
1878	By deep surmise of others' detriment;
1879	Losing her woes in shows of discontent.
1880	It easeth some, though none it ever cured,
1881	To think their dolour others have endured.
1882	
1883	But now the mindful messenger, come back,
1884	Brings home his lord and other company;
1885	Who finds his Lucrece clad in mourning black:
1886	And round about her tear-stained eye
1887	Blue circles stream'd; like rainbows in the sky:
1888	These water-galls in her dim element
1889	Foretell new storms to those already spent.
1890	
1891	Which when her sad-beholding husband saw,
1892	Amazedly in her sad face he stares:
1893	Her eyes, though sod in tears, look'd red and raw,
1894	Her lively colour kill'd with deadly cares.
1895	He hath no power to ask her how she fares:
1896	Both stood, like old acquaintance in a trance,
1897	Met far from home, wondering each other's chance.
1898	
1899	At last he takes her by the bloodless hand,
1900	And thus begins: 'What uncouth ill event
1901	Hath thee befall'n, that thou dost trembling stand?
1902	Sweet love, what spite hath thy fair colour spent?
1903	Why art thou thus attired in discontent?
1904	Unmask, dear dear, this moody heaviness,
1905	And tell thy grief, that we may give redress.'
1906	
1907	Three times with sighs she gives her sorrow fire,
1908	Ere once she can discharge one word of woe:
1909	At length address'd to answer his desire,
1910	She modestly prepares to let them know
1911	Her honour is ta'en prisoner by the foe;
1912	While Collatine and his consorted lords
1913	With sad attention long to hear her words.
1914	
1915	And now this pale swan in her watery nest
1916	Begins the sad dirge of her certain ending;
1917	'Few words,' quoth she, 'Shall fit the trespass best,
1918	Where no excuse can give the fault amending:
1919	In me moe woes than words are now depending;
1920	And my laments would be drawn out too long,
1921	To tell them all with one poor tired tongue.
1922	
1923	'Then be this all the task it hath to say
1924	Dear husband, in the interest of thy bed
1925	A stranger came, and on that pillow lay
1926	Where thou was wont to rest thy weary head;
1927	And what wrong else may be imagined
1928	By foul enforcement might be done to me,
1929	From that, alas, thy Lucrece is not free.
1930	
1931	'For in the dreadful dead of dark midnight,
1932	With shining falchion in my chamber came
1933	A creeping creature, with a flaming light,
1934	And softly cried 'Awake, thou Roman dame,
1935	And entertain my love; else lasting shame
1936	On thee and thine this night I will inflict,
1937	If thou my love's desire do contradict.
1938	
1939	' 'For some hard-favour'd groom of thine,' quoth he,
1940	'Unless thou yoke thy liking to my will,
1941	I'll murder straight, and then I'll slaughter thee
1942	And swear I found you where you did fulfil
1943	The loathsome act of lust, and so did kill
1944	The lechers in their deed: this act will be
1945	My fame and thy perpetual infamy.'
1946	
1947	'With this, I did begin to start and cry;
1948	And then against my heart he sets his sword,
1949	Swearing, unless I took all patiently,
1950	I should not live to speak another word;
1951	So should my shame still rest upon record,
1952	And never be forgot in mighty Rome
1953	Th' adulterate death of Lucrece and her groom.
1954	
1955	'Mine enemy was strong, my poor self weak,
1956	And far the weaker with so strong a fear:
1957	My bloody judge forbade my tongue to speak;
1958	No rightful plea might plead for justice there:
1959	His scarlet lust came evidence to swear
1960	That my poor beauty had purloin'd his eyes;
1961	And when the judge is robb'd the prisoner dies.
1962	
1963	'O, teach me how to make mine own excuse!
1964	Or at the least this refuge let me find;
1965	Though my gross blood be stain'd with this abuse,
1966	Immaculate and spotless is my mind;
1967	That was not forced; that never was inclined
1968	To accessary yieldings, but still pure
1969	Doth in her poison'd closet yet endure.'
1970	
1971	Lo, here, the hopeless merchant of this loss,
1972	With head declined, and voice damm'd up with woe,
1973	With sad set eyes, and wretched arms across,
1974	From lips new-waxen pale begins to blow
1975	The grief away that stops his answer so:
1976	But, wretched as he is, he strives in vain;
1977	What he breathes out his breath drinks up again.
1978	
1979	As through an arch the violent roaring tide
1980	Outruns the eye that doth behold his haste,
1981	Yet in the eddy boundeth in his pride
1982	Back to the strait that forced him on so fast;
1983	In rage sent out, recall'd in rage, being past:
1984	Even so his sighs, his sorrows, make a saw,
1985	To push grief on, and back the same grief draw.
1986	
1987	Which speechless woe of his poor she attendeth,
1988	And his untimely frenzy thus awaketh:
1989	'Dear lord, thy sorrow to my sorrow lendeth
1990	Another power; no flood by raining slaketh.
1991	My woe too sensible thy passion maketh
1992	More feeling-painful: let it then suffice
1993	To drown one woe, one pair of weeping eyes.
1994	
1995	'And for my sake, when I might charm thee so,
1996	For she that was thy Lucrece, now attend me:
1997	Be suddenly revenged on my foe,
1998	Thine, mine, his own: suppose thou dost defend me
1999	From what is past: the help that thou shalt lend me
2000	Comes all too late, yet let the traitor die;
2001	For sparing justice feeds iniquity.
2002	
2003	'But ere I name him, you fair lords,' quoth she,
2004	Speaking to those that came with Collatine,
2005	'Shall plight your honourable faiths to me,
2006	With swift pursuit to venge this wrong of mine;
2007	For 'tis a meritorious fair design
2008	To chase injustice with revengeful arms:
2009	Knights, by their oaths, should right poor ladies' harms.'
2010	
2011	At this request, with noble disposition
2012	Each present lord began to promise aid,
2013	As bound in knighthood to her imposition,
2014	Longing to hear the hateful foe bewray'd.
2015	But she, that yet her sad task hath not said,
2016	The protestation stops. 'O, speak, ' quoth she,
2017	'How may this forced stain be wiped from me?
2018	
2019	'What is the quality of mine offence,
2020	Being constrain'd with dreadful circumstance?
2021	May my pure mind with the foul act dispense,
2022	My low-declined honour to advance?
2023	May any terms acquit me from this chance?
2024	The poison'd fountain clears itself again;
2025	And why not I from this compelled stain?'
2026	
2027	With this, they all at once began to say,
2028	Her body's stain her mind untainted clears;
2029	While with a joyless smile she turns away
2030	The face, that map which deep impression bears
2031	Of hard misfortune, carved in it with tears.
2032	'No, no,' quoth she, 'no dame, hereafter living,
2033	By my excuse shall claim excuse's giving.'
2034	
2035	Here with a sigh, as if her heart would break,
2036	She throws forth Tarquin's name; 'He, he,' she says,
2037	But more than 'he' her poor tongue could not speak;
2038	Till after many accents and delays,
2039	Untimely breathings, sick and short assays,
2040	She utters this, 'He, he, fair lords, 'tis he,
2041	That guides this hand to give this wound to me.'
2042	
2043	Even here she sheathed in her harmless breast
2044	A harmful knife, that thence her soul unsheathed:
2045	That blow did that it from the deep unrest
2046	Of that polluted prison where it breathed:
2047	Her contrite sighs unto the clouds bequeath'd
2048	Her winged sprite, and through her wounds doth fly
2049	Life's lasting date from cancell'd destiny.
2050	
2051	Stone-still, astonish'd with this deadly deed,
2052	Stood Collatine and all his lordly crew;
2053	Till Lucrece' father, that beholds her bleed,
2054	Himself on her self-slaughter'd body threw;
2055	And from the purple fountain Brutus drew
2056	The murderous knife, and, as it left the place,
2057	Her blood, in poor revenge, held it in chase;
2058	
2059	And bubbling from her breast, it doth divide
2060	In two slow rivers, that the crimson blood
2061	Circles her body in on every side,
2062	Who, like a late-sack'd island, vastly stood
2063	Bare and unpeopled in this fearful flood.
2064	Some of her blood still pure and red remain'd,
2065	And some look'd black, and that false Tarquin stain'd.
2066	
2067	About the mourning and congealed face
2068	Of that black blood a watery rigol goes,
2069	Which seems to weep upon the tainted place:
2070	And ever since, as pitying Lucrece' woes,
2071	Corrupted blood some watery token shows;
2072	And blood untainted still doth red abide,
2073	Blushing at that which is so putrified.
2074	
2075	'Daughter, dear daughter,' old Lucretius cries,
2076	'That life was mine which thou hast here deprived.
2077	If in the child the father's image lies,
2078	Where shall I live now Lucrece is unlived?
2079	Thou wast not to this end from me derived.
2080	If children predecease progenitors,
2081	We are their offspring, and they none of ours.
2082	
2083	'Poor broken glass, I often did behold
2084	In thy sweet semblance my old age new born;
2085	But now that fresh fair mirror, dim and old,
2086	Shows me a bare-boned death by time out-worn:
2087	O, from thy cheeks my image thou hast torn,
2088	And shivered all the beauty of my glass,
2089	That I no more can see what once I was!
2090	
2091	'O time, cease thou thy course and last no longer,
2092	If they surcease to be that should survive.
2093	Shall rotten death make conquest of the stronger
2094	And leave the faltering feeble souls alive?
2095	The old bees die, the young possess their hive:
2096	Then live, sweet Lucrece, live again and see
2097	Thy father die, and not thy father thee!
2098	
2099	By this, starts Collatine as from a dream,
2100	And bids Lucretius give his sorrow place;
2101	And then in key-cold Lucrece' bleeding stream
2102	He falls, and bathes the pale fear in his face,
2103	And counterfeits to die with her a space;
2104	Till manly shame bids him possess his breath
2105	And live to be revenged on her death.
2106	
2107	The deep vexation of his inward soul
2108	Hath served a dumb arrest upon his tongue;
2109	Who, mad that sorrow should his use control,
2110	Or keep him from heart-easing words so long,
2111	Begins to talk; but through his lips do throng
2112	Weak words, so thick come in his poor heart's aid,
2113	That no man could distinguish what he said.
2114	
2115	Yet sometime 'Tarquin' was pronounced plain,
2116	But through his teeth, as if the name he tore.
2117	This windy tempest, till it blow up rain,
2118	Held back his sorrow's tide, to make it more;
2119	At last it rains, and busy winds give o'er:
2120	Then son and father weep with equal strife
2121	Who should weep most, for daughter or for wife.
2122	
2123	The one doth call her his, the other his,
2124	Yet neither may possess the claim they lay.
2125	The father says 'She's mine.' 'O, mine she is,'
2126	Replies her husband: 'do not take away
2127	My sorrow's interest; let no mourner say
2128	He weeps for her, for she was only mine,
2129	And only must be wail'd by Collatine.'
2130	
2131	'O,' quoth Lucretius,' I did give that life
2132	Which she too early and too late hath spill'd.'
2133	'Woe, woe,' quoth Collatine, 'she was my wife,
2134	I owed her, and 'tis mine that she hath kill'd.'
2135	'My daughter' and 'my wife' with clamours fill'd
2136	The dispersed air, who, holding Lucrece' life,
2137	Answer'd their cries, 'my daughter' and 'my wife.'
2138	
2139	Brutus, who pluck'd the knife from Lucrece' side,
2140	Seeing such emulation in their woe,
2141	Began to clothe his wit in state and pride,
2142	Burying in Lucrece' wound his folly's show.
2143	He with the Romans was esteemed so
2144	As silly-jeering idiots are with kings,
2145	For sportive words and uttering foolish things:
2146	
2147	But now he throws that shallow habit by,
2148	Wherein deep policy did him disguise;
2149	And arm'd his long-hid wits advisedly,
2150	To cheque the tears in Collatinus' eyes.
2151	'Thou wronged lord of Rome,' quoth be, 'arise:
2152	Let my unsounded self, supposed a fool,
2153	Now set thy long-experienced wit to school.
2154	
2155	'Why, Collatine, is woe the cure for woe?
2156	Do wounds help wounds, or grief help grievous deeds?
2157	Is it revenge to give thyself a blow
2158	For his foul act by whom thy fair wife bleeds?
2159	Such childish humour from weak minds proceeds:
2160	Thy wretched wife mistook the matter so,
2161	To slay herself, that should have slain her foe.
2162	
2163	'Courageous Roman, do not steep thy heart
2164	In such relenting dew of lamentations;
2165	But kneel with me and help to bear thy part,
2166	To rouse our Roman gods with invocations,
2167	That they will suffer these abominations,
2168	Since Rome herself in them doth stand disgraced,
2169	By our strong arms from forth her fair streets chased.
2170	
2171	'Now, by the Capitol that we adore,
2172	And by this chaste blood so unjustly stain'd,
2173	By heaven's fair sun that breeds the fat earth's
2174	store,
2175	By all our country rights in Rome maintain'd,
2176	And by chaste Lucrece' soul that late complain'd
2177	Her wrongs to us, and by this bloody knife,
2178	We will revenge the death of this true wife.'
2179	
2180	This said, he struck his hand upon his breast,
2181	And kiss'd the fatal knife, to end his vow;
2182	And to his protestation urged the rest,
2183	Who, wondering at him, did his words allow:
2184	Then jointly to the ground their knees they bow;
2185	And that deep vow, which Brutus made before,
2186	He doth again repeat, and that they swore.
2187	
2188	When they had sworn to this advised doom,
2189	They did conclude to bear dead Lucrece thence;
2190	To show her bleeding body thorough Rome,
2191	And so to publish Tarquin's foul offence:
2192	Which being done with speedy diligence,
2193	The Romans plausibly did give consent
2194	To Tarquin's everlasting banishment.

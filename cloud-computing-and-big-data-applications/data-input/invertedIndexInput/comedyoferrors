56	ACT I
57	
58	
59	
60	SCENE I	A hall in DUKE SOLINUS'S palace.
61	
62	
63	[Enter DUKE SOLINUS, AEGEON, Gaoler, Officers, and other
64	Attendants]
65	
66	AEGEON	Proceed, Solinus, to procure my fall
67	And by the doom of death end woes and all.
68	
69	DUKE SOLINUS	Merchant of Syracuse, plead no more;
70	I am not partial to infringe our laws:
71	The enmity and discord which of late
72	Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your duke
73	To merchants, our well-dealing countrymen,
74	Who wanting guilders to redeem their lives
75	Have seal'd his rigorous statutes with their bloods,
76	Excludes all pity from our threatening looks.
77	For, since the mortal and intestine jars
78	'Twixt thy seditious countrymen and us,
79	It hath in solemn synods been decreed
80	Both by the Syracusians and ourselves,
81	To admit no traffic to our adverse towns Nay, more,
82	If any born at Ephesus be seen
83	At any Syracusian marts and fairs;
84	Again: if any Syracusian born
85	Come to the bay of Ephesus, he dies,
86	His goods confiscate to the duke's dispose,
87	Unless a thousand marks be levied,
88	To quit the penalty and to ransom him.
89	Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
90	Cannot amount unto a hundred marks;
91	Therefore by law thou art condemned to die.
92	
93	AEGEON	Yet this my comfort: when your words are done,
94	My woes end likewise with the evening sun.
95	
96	DUKE SOLINUS	Well, Syracusian, say in brief the cause
97	Why thou departed'st from thy native home
98	And for what cause thou camest to Ephesus.
99	
100	AEGEON	A heavier task could not have been imposed
101	Than I to speak my griefs unspeakable:
102	Yet, that the world may witness that my end
103	Was wrought by nature, not by vile offence,
104	I'll utter what my sorrows give me leave.
105	In Syracusa was I born, and wed
106	Unto a woman, happy but for me,
107	And by me, had not our hap been bad.
108	With her I lived in joy; our wealth increased
109	By prosperous voyages I often made
110	To Epidamnum; till my factor's death
111	And the great care of goods at random left
112	Drew me from kind embracements of my spouse:
113	From whom my absence was not six months old
114	Before herself, almost at fainting under
115	The pleasing punishment that women bear,
116	Had made provision for her following me
117	And soon and safe arrived where I was.
118	There had she not been long, but she became
119	A joyful mother of two goodly sons;
120	And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
121	As could not be distinguish'd but by names.
122	That very hour, and in the self-same inn,
123	A meaner woman was delivered
124	Of such a burden, male twins, both alike:
125	Those,--for their parents were exceeding poor,--
126	I bought and brought up to attend my sons.
127	My wife, not meanly proud of two such boys,
128	Made daily motions for our home return:
129	Unwilling I agreed. Alas! too soon,
130	We came aboard.
131	A league from Epidamnum had we sail'd,
132	Before the always wind-obeying deep
133	Gave any tragic instance of our harm:
134	But longer did we not retain much hope;
135	For what obscured light the heavens did grant
136	Did but convey unto our fearful minds
137	A doubtful warrant of immediate death;
138	Which though myself would gladly have embraced,
139	Yet the incessant weepings of my wife,
140	Weeping before for what she saw must come,
141	And piteous plainings of the pretty babes,
142	That mourn'd for fashion, ignorant what to fear,
143	Forced me to seek delays for them and me.
144	And this it was, for other means was none:
145	The sailors sought for safety by our boat,
146	And left the ship, then sinking-ripe, to us:
147	My wife, more careful for the latter-born,
148	Had fasten'd him unto a small spare mast,
149	Such as seafaring men provide for storms;
150	To him one of the other twins was bound,
151	Whilst I had been like heedful of the other:
152	The children thus disposed, my wife and I,
153	Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fix'd,
154	Fasten'd ourselves at either end the mast;
155	And floating straight, obedient to the stream,
156	Was carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
157	At length the sun, gazing upon the earth,
158	Dispersed those vapours that offended us;
159	And by the benefit of his wished light,
160	The seas wax'd calm, and we discovered
161	Two ships from far making amain to us,
162	Of Corinth that, of Epidaurus this:
163	But ere they came,--O, let me say no more!
164	Gather the sequel by that went before.
165	
166	DUKE SOLINUS	Nay, forward, old man; do not break off so;
167	For we may pity, though not pardon thee.
168	
169	AEGEON	O, had the gods done so, I had not now
170	Worthily term'd them merciless to us!
171	For, ere the ships could meet by twice five leagues,
172	We were encounterd by a mighty rock;
173	Which being violently borne upon,
174	Our helpful ship was splitted in the midst;
175	So that, in this unjust divorce of us,
176	Fortune had left to both of us alike
177	What to delight in, what to sorrow for.
178	Her part, poor soul! seeming as burdened
179	With lesser weight but not with lesser woe,
180	Was carried with more speed before the wind;
181	And in our sight they three were taken up
182	By fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
183	At length, another ship had seized on us;
184	And, knowing whom it was their hap to save,
185	Gave healthful welcome to their shipwreck'd guests;
186	And would have reft the fishers of their prey,
187	Had not their bark been very slow of sail;
188	And therefore homeward did they bend their course.
189	Thus have you heard me sever'd from my bliss;
190	That by misfortunes was my life prolong'd,
191	To tell sad stories of my own mishaps.
192	
193	DUKE SOLINUS	And for the sake of them thou sorrowest for,
194	Do me the favour to dilate at full
195	What hath befall'n of them and thee till now.
196	
197	AEGEON	My youngest boy, and yet my eldest care,
198	At eighteen years became inquisitive
199	After his brother: and importuned me
200	That his attendant--so his case was like,
201	Reft of his brother, but retain'd his name--
202	Might bear him company in the quest of him:
203	Whom whilst I labour'd of a love to see,
204	I hazarded the loss of whom I loved.
205	Five summers have I spent in furthest Greece,
206	Roaming clean through the bounds of Asia,
207	And, coasting homeward, came to Ephesus;
208	Hopeless to find, yet loath to leave unsought
209	Or that or any place that harbours men.
210	But here must end the story of my life;
211	And happy were I in my timely death,
212	Could all my travels warrant me they live.
213	
214	DUKE SOLINUS	Hapless AEgeon, whom the fates have mark'd
215	To bear the extremity of dire mishap!
216	Now, trust me, were it not against our laws,
217	Against my crown, my oath, my dignity,
218	Which princes, would they, may not disannul,
219	My soul would sue as advocate for thee.
220	But, though thou art adjudged to the death
221	And passed sentence may not be recall'd
222	But to our honour's great disparagement,
223	Yet I will favour thee in what I can.
224	Therefore, merchant, I'll limit thee this day
225	To seek thy life by beneficial help:
226	Try all the friends thou hast in Ephesus;
227	Beg thou, or borrow, to make up the sum,
228	And live; if no, then thou art doom'd to die.
229	Gaoler, take him to thy custody.
230	
231	Gaoler	I will, my lord.
232	
233	AEGEON	Hopeless and helpless doth AEgeon wend,
234	But to procrastinate his lifeless end.
235

244	ACT I

246	
247	
248	SCENE II	The Mart.
249	
250	
251	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse, DROMIO of Syracuse,
252	and First Merchant]
253	
254	First Merchant	Therefore give out you are of Epidamnum,
255	Lest that your goods too soon be confiscate.
256	This very day a Syracusian merchant
257	Is apprehended for arrival here;
258	And not being able to buy out his life
259	According to the statute of the town,
260	Dies ere the weary sun set in the west.
261	There is your money that I had to keep.
262	
263	ANTIPHOLUS
264	OF SYRACUSE	Go bear it to the Centaur, where we host,
265	And stay there, Dromio, till I come to thee.
266	Within this hour it will be dinner-time:
267	Till that, I'll view the manners of the town,
268	Peruse the traders, gaze upon the buildings,
269	And then return and sleep within mine inn,
270	For with long travel I am stiff and weary.
271	Get thee away.
272	
273	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Many a man would take you at your word,
274	And go indeed, having so good a mean.
275	
276	[Exit]
277	
278	ANTIPHOLUS
279	OF SYRACUSE	A trusty villain, sir, that very oft,
280	When I am dull with care and melancholy,
281	Lightens my humour with his merry jests.
282	What, will you walk with me about the town,
283	And then go to my inn and dine with me?
284	
285	First Merchant	I am invited, sir, to certain merchants,
286	Of whom I hope to make much benefit;
287	I crave your pardon. Soon at five o'clock,
288	Please you, I'll meet with you upon the mart
289	And afterward consort you till bed-time:
290	My present business calls me from you now.
291	
292	ANTIPHOLUS
293	OF SYRACUSE	Farewell till then: I will go lose myself
294	And wander up and down to view the city.
295	
296	First Merchant	Sir, I commend you to your own content.
297	
298	[Exit]
299	
300	ANTIPHOLUS
301	OF SYRACUSE	He that commends me to mine own content
302	Commends me to the thing I cannot get.
303	I to the world am like a drop of water
304	That in the ocean seeks another drop,
305	Who, falling there to find his fellow forth,
306	Unseen, inquisitive, confounds himself:
307	So I, to find a mother and a brother,
308	In quest of them, unhappy, lose myself.
309	
310	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus]
311	
312	Here comes the almanac of my true date.
313	What now? how chance thou art return'd so soon?
314	
315	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Return'd so soon! rather approach'd too late:
316	The capon burns, the pig falls from the spit,
317	The clock hath strucken twelve upon the bell;
318	My mistress made it one upon my cheek:
319	She is so hot because the meat is cold;
320	The meat is cold because you come not home;
321	You come not home because you have no stomach;
322	You have no stomach having broke your fast;
323	But we that know what 'tis to fast and pray
324	Are penitent for your default to-day.
325	
326	ANTIPHOLUS
327	OF SYRACUSE	Stop in your wind, sir: tell me this, I pray:
328	Where have you left the money that I gave you?
329	
330	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O,--sixpence, that I had o' Wednesday last
331	To pay the saddler for my mistress' crupper?
332	The saddler had it, sir; I kept it not.
333	
334	ANTIPHOLUS
335	OF SYRACUSE	I am not in a sportive humour now:
336	Tell me, and dally not, where is the money?
337	We being strangers here, how darest thou trust
338	So great a charge from thine own custody?
339	
340	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I pray you, air, as you sit at dinner:
341	I from my mistress come to you in post;
342	If I return, I shall be post indeed,
343	For she will score your fault upon my pate.
344	Methinks your maw, like mine, should be your clock,
345	And strike you home without a messenger.
346	
347	ANTIPHOLUS
348	OF SYRACUSE	Come, Dromio, come, these jests are out of season;
349	Reserve them till a merrier hour than this.
350	Where is the gold I gave in charge to thee?
351	
352	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	To me, sir? why, you gave no gold to me.
353	
354	ANTIPHOLUS
355	OF SYRACUSE	Come on, sir knave, have done your foolishness,
356	And tell me how thou hast disposed thy charge.
357	
358	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	My charge was but to fetch you from the mart
359	Home to your house, the Phoenix, sir, to dinner:
360	My mistress and her sister stays for you.
361	
362	ANTIPHOLUS
363	OF SYRACUSE	In what safe place you have bestow'd my money,
364	Or I shall break that merry sconce of yours
365	That stands on tricks when I am undisposed:
366	Where is the thousand marks thou hadst of me?
367	
368	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I have some marks of yours upon my pate,
369	Some of my mistress' marks upon my shoulders,
370	But not a thousand marks between you both.
371	If I should pay your worship those again,
372	Perchance you will not bear them patiently.
373	
374	ANTIPHOLUS
375	OF SYRACUSE	Thy mistress' marks? what mistress, slave, hast thou?
376	
377	
378	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Your worship's wife, my mistress at the Phoenix;
379	She that doth fast till you come home to dinner,
380	And prays that you will hie you home to dinner.
381	
382	ANTIPHOLUS
383	OF SYRACUSE	What, wilt thou flout me thus unto my face,
384	Being forbid? There, take you that, sir knave.
385	
386	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	What mean you, sir? for God's sake, hold your hands!
387	Nay, and you will not, sir, I'll take my heels.
388	
389	[Exit]
390	
391	ANTIPHOLUS
392	OF SYRACUSE	Upon my life, by some device or other
393	The villain is o'er-raught of all my money.
394	They say this town is full of cozenage,
395	As, nimble jugglers that deceive the eye,
396	Dark-working sorcerers that change the mind,
397	Soul-killing witches that deform the body,
398	Disguised cheaters, prating mountebanks,
399	And many such-like liberties of sin:
400	If it prove so, I will be gone the sooner.
401	I'll to the Centaur, to go seek this slave:
402	I greatly fear my money is not safe.

413	
414	
415	
416	SCENE I	The house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
417	
418	
419	[Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA]
420	
421	ADRIANA	Neither my husband nor the slave return'd,
422	That in such haste I sent to seek his master!
423	Sure, Luciana, it is two o'clock.
424	
425	LUCIANA	Perhaps some merchant hath invited him,
426	And from the mart he's somewhere gone to dinner.
427	Good sister, let us dine and never fret:
428	A man is master of his liberty:
429	Time is their master, and, when they see time,
430	They'll go or come: if so, be patient, sister.
431	
432	ADRIANA	Why should their liberty than ours be more?
433	
434	LUCIANA	Because their business still lies out o' door.
435	
436	ADRIANA	Look, when I serve him so, he takes it ill.
437	
438	LUCIANA	O, know he is the bridle of your will.
439	
440	ADRIANA	There's none but asses will be bridled so.
441	
442	LUCIANA	Why, headstrong liberty is lash'd with woe.
443	There's nothing situate under heaven's eye
444	But hath his bound, in earth, in sea, in sky:
445	The beasts, the fishes, and the winged fowls,
446	Are their males' subjects and at their controls:
447	Men, more divine, the masters of all these,
448	Lords of the wide world and wild watery seas,
449	Indued with intellectual sense and souls,
450	Of more preeminence than fish and fowls,
451	Are masters to their females, and their lords:
452	Then let your will attend on their accords.
453	
454	ADRIANA	This servitude makes you to keep unwed.
455	
456	LUCIANA	Not this, but troubles of the marriage-bed.
457	
458	ADRIANA	But, were you wedded, you would bear some sway.
459	
460	LUCIANA	Ere I learn love, I'll practise to obey.
461	
462	ADRIANA	How if your husband start some other where?
463	
464	LUCIANA	Till he come home again, I would forbear.
465	
466	ADRIANA	Patience unmoved! no marvel though she pause;
467	They can be meek that have no other cause.
468	A wretched soul, bruised with adversity,
469	We bid be quiet when we hear it cry;
470	But were we burdened with like weight of pain,
471	As much or more would we ourselves complain:
472	So thou, that hast no unkind mate to grieve thee,
473	With urging helpless patience wouldst relieve me,
474	But, if thou live to see like right bereft,
475	This fool-begg'd patience in thee will be left.
476	
477	LUCIANA	Well, I will marry one day, but to try.
478	Here comes your man; now is your husband nigh.
479	
480	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus]
481	
482	ADRIANA	Say, is your tardy master now at hand?
483	
484	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, he's at two hands with me, and that my two ears
485	can witness.
486	
487	ADRIANA	Say, didst thou speak with him? know'st thou his mind?
488	
489	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Ay, ay, he told his mind upon mine ear:
490	Beshrew his hand, I scarce could understand it.
491	
492	LUCIANA	Spake he so doubtfully, thou couldst not feel his meaning?
493	
494	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, he struck so plainly, I could too well feel his
495	blows; and withal so doubtfully that I could scarce
496	understand them.
497	
498	ADRIANA	But say, I prithee, is he coming home? It seems he
499	hath great care to please his wife.
500	
501	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Why, mistress, sure my master is horn-mad.
502	
503	ADRIANA	Horn-mad, thou villain!
504	
505	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I mean not cuckold-mad;
506	But, sure, he is stark mad.
507	When I desired him to come home to dinner,
508	He ask'd me for a thousand marks in gold:
509	''Tis dinner-time,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he;
510	'Your meat doth burn,' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he:
511	'Will you come home?' quoth I; 'My gold!' quoth he.
512	'Where is the thousand marks I gave thee, villain?'
513	'The pig,' quoth I, 'is burn'd;' 'My gold!' quoth he:
514	'My mistress, sir' quoth I; 'Hang up thy mistress!
515	I know not thy mistress; out on thy mistress!'
516	
517	LUCIANA	Quoth who?
518	
519	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Quoth my master:
520	'I know,' quoth he, 'no house, no wife, no mistress.'
521	So that my errand, due unto my tongue,
522	I thank him, I bare home upon my shoulders;
523	For, in conclusion, he did beat me there.
524	
525	ADRIANA	Go back again, thou slave, and fetch him home.
526	
527	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Go back again, and be new beaten home?
528	For God's sake, send some other messenger.
529	
530	ADRIANA	Back, slave, or I will break thy pate across.
531	
532	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And he will bless that cross with other beating:
533	Between you I shall have a holy head.
534	
535	ADRIANA	Hence, prating peasant! fetch thy master home.
536	
537	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Am I so round with you as you with me,
538	That like a football you do spurn me thus?
539	You spurn me hence, and he will spurn me hither:
540	If I last in this service, you must case me in leather.
541	
542	[Exit]
543	
544	LUCIANA	Fie, how impatience loureth in your face!
545	
546	ADRIANA	His company must do his minions grace,
547	Whilst I at home starve for a merry look.
548	Hath homely age the alluring beauty took
549	From my poor cheek? then he hath wasted it:
550	Are my discourses dull? barren my wit?
551	If voluble and sharp discourse be marr'd,
552	Unkindness blunts it more than marble hard:
553	Do their gay vestments his affections bait?
554	That's not my fault: he's master of my state:
555	What ruins are in me that can be found,
556	By him not ruin'd? then is he the ground
557	Of my defeatures. My decayed fair
558	A sunny look of his would soon repair
559	But, too unruly deer, he breaks the pale
560	And feeds from home; poor I am but his stale.
561	
562	LUCIANA	Self-harming jealousy! fie, beat it hence!
563	
564	ADRIANA	Unfeeling fools can with such wrongs dispense.
565	I know his eye doth homage otherwhere,
566	Or else what lets it but he would be here?
567	Sister, you know he promised me a chain;
568	Would that alone, alone he would detain,
569	So he would keep fair quarter with his bed!
570	I see the jewel best enamelled
571	Will lose his beauty; yet the gold bides still,
572	That others touch, and often touching will
573	Wear gold: and no man that hath a name,
574	By falsehood and corruption doth it shame.
575	Since that my beauty cannot please his eye,
576	I'll weep what's left away, and weeping die.
577	
578	LUCIANA	How many fond fools serve mad jealousy!

585	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
586	
587	
588	ACT II
589	
590	
591	
592	SCENE II	A public place.
593	
594	
595	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse]
596	
597	ANTIPHOLUS
598	OF SYRACUSE	The gold I gave to Dromio is laid up
599	Safe at the Centaur; and the heedful slave
600	Is wander'd forth, in care to seek me out
601	By computation and mine host's report.
602	I could not speak with Dromio since at first
603	I sent him from the mart. See, here he comes.
604	
605	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]
606	
607	How now sir! is your merry humour alter'd?
608	As you love strokes, so jest with me again.
609	You know no Centaur? you received no gold?
610	Your mistress sent to have me home to dinner?
611	My house was at the Phoenix? Wast thou mad,
612	That thus so madly thou didst answer me?
613	
614	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	What answer, sir? when spake I such a word?
615	
616	ANTIPHOLUS
617	OF SYRACUSE	Even now, even here, not half an hour since.
618	
619	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I did not see you since you sent me hence,
620	Home to the Centaur, with the gold you gave me.
621	
622	ANTIPHOLUS
623	OF SYRACUSE	Villain, thou didst deny the gold's receipt,
624	And told'st me of a mistress and a dinner;
625	For which, I hope, thou felt'st I was displeased.
626	
627	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am glad to see you in this merry vein:
628	What means this jest? I pray you, master, tell me.
629	
630	ANTIPHOLUS
631	OF SYRACUSE	Yea, dost thou jeer and flout me in the teeth?
632	Think'st thou I jest? Hold, take thou that, and that.
633	
634	[Beating him]
635	
636	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Hold, sir, for God's sake! now your jest is earnest:
637	Upon what bargain do you give it me?
638	
639	ANTIPHOLUS
640	OF SYRACUSE	Because that I familiarly sometimes
641	Do use you for my fool and chat with you,
642	Your sauciness will jest upon my love
643	And make a common of my serious hours.
644	When the sun shines let foolish gnats make sport,
645	But creep in crannies when he hides his beams.
646	If you will jest with me, know my aspect,
647	And fashion your demeanor to my looks,
648	Or I will beat this method in your sconce.
649	
650	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Sconce call you it? so you would leave battering, I
651	had rather have it a head: an you use these blows
652	long, I must get a sconce for my head and ensconce
653	it too; or else I shall seek my wit in my shoulders.
654	But, I pray, sir why am I beaten?
655	
656	ANTIPHOLUS
657	OF SYRACUSE	Dost thou not know?
658	
659	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nothing, sir, but that I am beaten.
660	
661	ANTIPHOLUS
662	OF SYRACUSE	Shall I tell you why?
663	
664	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Ay, sir, and wherefore; for they say every why hath
665	a wherefore.
666	
667	ANTIPHOLUS
668	OF SYRACUSE	Why, first,--for flouting me; and then, wherefore--
669	For urging it the second time to me.
670	
671	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Was there ever any man thus beaten out of season,
672	When in the why and the wherefore is neither rhyme
673	nor reason?
674	Well, sir, I thank you.
675	
676	ANTIPHOLUS
677	OF SYRACUSE	Thank me, sir, for what?
678	
679	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, for this something that you gave me for nothing.
680	
681	ANTIPHOLUS
682	OF SYRACUSE	I'll make you amends next, to give you nothing for
683	something. But say, sir, is it dinner-time?
684	
685	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, sir; I think the meat wants that I have.
686	
687	ANTIPHOLUS
688	OF SYRACUSE	In good time, sir; what's that?
689	
690	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Basting.
691	
692	ANTIPHOLUS
693	OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, then 'twill be dry.
694	
695	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	If it be, sir, I pray you, eat none of it.
696	
697	ANTIPHOLUS
698	OF SYRACUSE	Your reason?
699	
700	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Lest it make you choleric and purchase me another
701	dry basting.
702	
703	ANTIPHOLUS
704	OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, learn to jest in good time: there's a
705	time for all things.
706	
707	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I durst have denied that, before you were so choleric.
708	
709	ANTIPHOLUS
710	OF SYRACUSE	By what rule, sir?
711	
712	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, by a rule as plain as the plain bald
713	pate of father Time himself.
714	
715	ANTIPHOLUS
716	OF SYRACUSE	Let's hear it.
717	
718	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	There's no time for a man to recover his hair that
719	grows bald by nature.
720	
721	ANTIPHOLUS
722	OF SYRACUSE	May he not do it by fine and recovery?
723	
724	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Yes, to pay a fine for a periwig and recover the
725	lost hair of another man.
726	
727	ANTIPHOLUS
728	OF SYRACUSE	Why is Time such a niggard of hair, being, as it is,
729	so plentiful an excrement?
730	
731	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Because it is a blessing that he bestows on beasts;
732	and what he hath scanted men in hair he hath given them in wit.
733	
734	ANTIPHOLUS
735	OF SYRACUSE	Why, but there's many a man hath more hair than wit.
736	
737	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not a man of those but he hath the wit to lose his hair.
738	
739	ANTIPHOLUS
740	OF SYRACUSE	Why, thou didst conclude hairy men plain dealers without wit.
741	
742	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	The plainer dealer, the sooner lost: yet he loseth
743	it in a kind of jollity.
744	
745	ANTIPHOLUS
746	OF SYRACUSE	For what reason?
747	
748	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	For two; and sound ones too.
749	
750	ANTIPHOLUS
751	OF SYRACUSE	Nay, not sound, I pray you.
752	
753	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Sure ones, then.
754	
755	ANTIPHOLUS
756	OF SYRACUSE	Nay, not sure, in a thing falsing.
757	
758	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Certain ones then.
759	
760	ANTIPHOLUS
761	OF SYRACUSE	Name them.
762	
763	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	The one, to save the money that he spends in
764	trimming; the other, that at dinner they should not
765	drop in his porridge.
766	
767	ANTIPHOLUS
768	OF SYRACUSE	You would all this time have proved there is no
769	time for all things.
770	
771	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, and did, sir; namely, no time to recover hair
772	lost by nature.
773	
774	ANTIPHOLUS
775	OF SYRACUSE	But your reason was not substantial, why there is no
776	time to recover.
777	
778	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Thus I mend it: Time himself is bald and therefore
779	to the world's end will have bald followers.
780	
781	ANTIPHOLUS
782	OF SYRACUSE	I knew 'twould be a bald conclusion:
783	But, soft! who wafts us yonder?
784	
785	[Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA]
786	
787	ADRIANA	Ay, ay, Antipholus, look strange and frown:
788	Some other mistress hath thy sweet aspects;
789	I am not Adriana nor thy wife.
790	The time was once when thou unurged wouldst vow
791	That never words were music to thine ear,
792	That never object pleasing in thine eye,
793	That never touch well welcome to thy hand,
794	That never meat sweet-savor'd in thy taste,
795	Unless I spake, or look'd, or touch'd, or carved to thee.
796	How comes it now, my husband, O, how comes it,
797	That thou art thus estranged from thyself?
798	Thyself I call it, being strange to me,
799	That, undividable, incorporate,
800	Am better than thy dear self's better part.
801	Ah, do not tear away thyself from me!
802	For know, my love, as easy mayest thou fall
803	A drop of water in the breaking gulf,
804	And take unmingled that same drop again,
805	Without addition or diminishing,
806	As take from me thyself and not me too.
807	How dearly would it touch me to the quick,
808	Shouldst thou but hear I were licentious
809	And that this body, consecrate to thee,
810	By ruffian lust should be contaminate!
811	Wouldst thou not spit at me and spurn at me
812	And hurl the name of husband in my face
813	And tear the stain'd skin off my harlot-brow
814	And from my false hand cut the wedding-ring
815	And break it with a deep-divorcing vow?
816	I know thou canst; and therefore see thou do it.
817	I am possess'd with an adulterate blot;
818	My blood is mingled with the crime of lust:
819	For if we too be one and thou play false,
820	I do digest the poison of thy flesh,
821	Being strumpeted by thy contagion.
822	Keep then far league and truce with thy true bed;
823	I live unstain'd, thou undishonoured.
824	
825	ANTIPHOLUS
826	OF SYRACUSE	Plead you to me, fair dame? I know you not:
827	In Ephesus I am but two hours old,
828	As strange unto your town as to your talk;
829	Who, every word by all my wit being scann'd,
830	Want wit in all one word to understand.
831	
832	LUCIANA	Fie, brother! how the world is changed with you!
833	When were you wont to use my sister thus?
834	She sent for you by Dromio home to dinner.
835	
836	ANTIPHOLUS
837	OF SYRACUSE	By Dromio?
838	
839	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	By me?
840	
841	ADRIANA	By thee; and this thou didst return from him,
842	That he did buffet thee, and, in his blows,
843	Denied my house for his, me for his wife.
844	
845	ANTIPHOLUS
846	OF SYRACUSE	Did you converse, sir, with this gentlewoman?
847	What is the course and drift of your compact?
848	
849	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I, sir? I never saw her till this time.
850	
851	ANTIPHOLUS
852	OF SYRACUSE	Villain, thou liest; for even her very words
853	Didst thou deliver to me on the mart.
854	
855	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I never spake with her in all my life.
856	
857	ANTIPHOLUS
858	OF SYRACUSE	How can she thus then call us by our names,
859	Unless it be by inspiration.
860	
861	ADRIANA	How ill agrees it with your gravity
862	To counterfeit thus grossly with your slave,
863	Abetting him to thwart me in my mood!
864	Be it my wrong you are from me exempt,
865	But wrong not that wrong with a more contempt.
866	Come, I will fasten on this sleeve of thine:
867	Thou art an elm, my husband, I a vine,
868	Whose weakness, married to thy stronger state,
869	Makes me with thy strength to communicate:
870	If aught possess thee from me, it is dross,
871	Usurping ivy, brier, or idle moss;
872	Who, all for want of pruning, with intrusion
873	Infect thy sap and live on thy confusion.
874	
875	ANTIPHOLUS
876	OF SYRACUSE	To me she speaks; she moves me for her theme:
877	What, was I married to her in my dream?
878	Or sleep I now and think I hear all this?
879	What error drives our eyes and ears amiss?
880	Until I know this sure uncertainty,
881	I'll entertain the offer'd fallacy.
882	
883	LUCIANA	Dromio, go bid the servants spread for dinner.
884	
885	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, for my beads! I cross me for a sinner.
886	This is the fairy land: O spite of spites!
887	We talk with goblins, owls and sprites:
888	If we obey them not, this will ensue,
889	They'll suck our breath, or pinch us black and blue.
890	
891	LUCIANA	Why pratest thou to thyself and answer'st not?
892	Dromio, thou drone, thou snail, thou slug, thou sot!
893	
894	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am transformed, master, am I not?
895	
896	ANTIPHOLUS
897	OF SYRACUSE	I think thou art in mind, and so am I.
898	
899	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nay, master, both in mind and in my shape.
900	
901	ANTIPHOLUS
902	OF SYRACUSE	Thou hast thine own form.
903	
904	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, I am an ape.
905	
906	LUCIANA	If thou art changed to aught, 'tis to an ass.
907	
908	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	'Tis true; she rides me and I long for grass.
909	'Tis so, I am an ass; else it could never be
910	But I should know her as well as she knows me.
911	
912	ADRIANA	Come, come, no longer will I be a fool,
913	To put the finger in the eye and weep,
914	Whilst man and master laugh my woes to scorn.
915	Come, sir, to dinner. Dromio, keep the gate.
916	Husband, I'll dine above with you to-day
917	And shrive you of a thousand idle pranks.
918	Sirrah, if any ask you for your master,
919	Say he dines forth, and let no creature enter.
920	Come, sister. Dromio, play the porter well.
921	
922	ANTIPHOLUS
923	OF SYRACUSE	Am I in earth, in heaven, or in hell?
924	Sleeping or waking? mad or well-advised?
925	Known unto these, and to myself disguised!
926	I'll say as they say and persever so,
927	And in this mist at all adventures go.
928	
929	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, shall I be porter at the gate?
930	
931	ADRIANA	Ay; and let none enter, lest I break your pate.
932	
933	LUCIANA	Come, come, Antipholus, we dine too late.

940	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
941	
942	
943	ACT III
944	
945	
946	
947	SCENE I	Before the house of ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus.
948	
949	
950	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus, DROMIO of Ephesus,
951	ANGELO, and BALTHAZAR]
952	
953	ANTIPHOLUS
954	OF EPHESUS	Good Signior Angelo, you must excuse us all;
955	My wife is shrewish when I keep not hours:
956	Say that I linger'd with you at your shop
957	To see the making of her carcanet,
958	And that to-morrow you will bring it home.
959	But here's a villain that would face me down
960	He met me on the mart, and that I beat him,
961	And charged him with a thousand marks in gold,
962	And that I did deny my wife and house.
963	Thou drunkard, thou, what didst thou mean by this?
964	
965	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Say what you will, sir, but I know what I know;
966	That you beat me at the mart, I have your hand to show:
967	If the skin were parchment, and the blows you gave were ink,
968	Your own handwriting would tell you what I think.
969	
970	ANTIPHOLUS
971	OF EPHESUS	I think thou art an ass.
972	
973	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Marry, so it doth appear
974	By the wrongs I suffer and the blows I bear.
975	I should kick, being kick'd; and, being at that pass,
976	You would keep from my heels and beware of an ass.
977	
978	ANTIPHOLUS
979	OF EPHESUS	You're sad, Signior Balthazar: pray God our cheer
980	May answer my good will and your good welcome here.
981	
982	BALTHAZAR	I hold your dainties cheap, sir, and your
983	welcome dear.
984	
985	ANTIPHOLUS
986	OF EPHESUS	O, Signior Balthazar, either at flesh or fish,
987	A table full of welcome make scarce one dainty dish.
988	
989	BALTHAZAR	Good meat, sir, is common; that every churl affords.
990	
991	ANTIPHOLUS
992	OF EPHESUS	And welcome more common; for that's nothing but words.
993	
994	BALTHAZAR	Small cheer and great welcome makes a merry feast.
995	
996	ANTIPHOLUS
997	OF EPHESUS	Ay, to a niggardly host, and more sparing guest:
998	But though my cates be mean, take them in good part;
999	Better cheer may you have, but not with better heart.
1000	But, soft! my door is lock'd. Go bid them let us in.
1001	
1002	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Maud, Bridget, Marian, Cicel, Gillian, Ginn!
1003	
1004	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Mome, malt-horse, capon, coxcomb,
1005	idiot, patch!
1006	Either get thee from the door, or sit down at the hatch.
1007	Dost thou conjure for wenches, that thou call'st
1008	for such store,
1009	When one is one too many? Go, get thee from the door.
1010	
1011	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	What patch is made our porter? My master stays in
1012	the street.
1013	
1014	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Let him walk from whence he came, lest he
1015	catch cold on's feet.
1016	
1017	ANTIPHOLUS
1018	OF EPHESUS	Who talks within there? ho, open the door!
1019	
1020	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Right, sir; I'll tell you when, an you tell
1021	me wherefore.
1022	
1023	ANTIPHOLUS
1024	OF EPHESUS	Wherefore? for my dinner: I have not dined to-day.
1025	
1026	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Nor to-day here you must not; come again
1027	when you may.
1028	
1029	ANTIPHOLUS
1030	OF EPHESUS	What art thou that keepest me out from the house I owe?
1031	
1032	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  The porter for this time, sir, and my name
1033	is Dromio.
1034	
1035	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O villain! thou hast stolen both mine office and my name.
1036	The one ne'er got me credit, the other mickle blame.
1037	If thou hadst been Dromio to-day in my place,
1038	Thou wouldst have changed thy face for a name or thy
1039	name for an ass.
1040	
1041	LUCE	[Within]  What a coil is there, Dromio? who are those
1042	at the gate?
1043	
1044	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Let my master in, Luce.
1045	
1046	LUCE	[Within]  Faith, no; he comes too late;
1047	And so tell your master.
1048	
1049	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	O Lord, I must laugh!
1050	Have at you with a proverb--Shall I set in my staff?
1051	
1052	LUCE	[Within]  Have at you with another; that's--When?
1053	can you tell?
1054	
1055	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  If thy name be call'd Luce--Luce, thou hast
1056	answered him well.
1057	
1058	ANTIPHOLUS	Do you hear, you minion? you'll let us in, I hope?
1059	OF EPHESUS
1060	
1061	LUCE	[Within]  I thought to have asked you.
1062	
1063	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  And you said no.
1064	
1065	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	So, come, help: well struck! there was blow for blow.
1066	
1067	ANTIPHOLUS
1068	OF EPHESUS	Thou baggage, let me in.
1069	
1070	LUCE	[Within]  Can you tell for whose sake?
1071	
1072	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Master, knock the door hard.
1073	
1074	LUCE	[Within]  Let him knock till it ache.
1075	
1076	ANTIPHOLUS
1077	OF EPHESUS	You'll cry for this, minion, if I beat the door down.
1078	
1079	LUCE	[Within]  What needs all that, and a pair of stocks in the town?
1080	
1081	ADRIANA	[Within]  Who is that at the door that keeps all
1082	this noise?
1083	
1084	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  By my troth, your town is troubled with
1085	unruly boys.
1086	
1087	ANTIPHOLUS
1088	OF EPHESUS	Are you there, wife? you might have come before.
1089	
1090	ADRIANA	[Within]  Your wife, sir knave! go get you from the door.
1091	
1092	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	If you went in pain, master, this 'knave' would go sore.
1093	
1094	ANGELO	Here is neither cheer, sir, nor welcome: we would
1095	fain have either.
1096	
1097	BALTHAZAR	In debating which was best, we shall part with neither.
1098	
1099	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	They stand at the door, master; bid them welcome hither.
1100	
1101	ANTIPHOLUS
1102	OF EPHESUS	There is something in the wind, that we cannot get in.
1103	
1104	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	You would say so, master, if your garments were thin.
1105	Your cake there is warm within; you stand here in the cold:
1106	It would make a man mad as a buck, to be so bought and sold.
1107	
1108	ANTIPHOLUS
1109	OF EPHESUS	Go fetch me something: I'll break ope the gate.
1110	
1111	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Break any breaking here, and I'll break your
1112	knave's pate.
1113	
1114	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	A man may break a word with you, sir, and words are but wind,
1115	Ay, and break it in your face, so he break it not behind.
1116	
1117	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  It seems thou want'st breaking: out upon
1118	thee, hind!
1119	
1120	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Here's too much 'out upon thee!' I pray thee,
1121	let me in.
1122	
1123	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	[Within]  Ay, when fowls have no feathers and fish have no fin.
1124	
1125	ANTIPHOLUS
1126	OF EPHESUS	Well, I'll break in: go borrow me a crow.
1127	
1128	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	A crow without feather? Master, mean you so?
1129	For a fish without a fin, there's a fowl without a feather;
1130	If a crow help us in, sirrah, we'll pluck a crow together.
1131	
1132	ANTIPHOLUS
1133	OF EPHESUS	Go get thee gone; fetch me an iron crow.
1134	
1135	BALTHAZAR	Have patience, sir; O, let it not be so!
1136	Herein you war against your reputation
1137	And draw within the compass of suspect
1138	The unviolated honour of your wife.
1139	Once this,--your long experience of her wisdom,
1140	Her sober virtue, years and modesty,
1141	Plead on her part some cause to you unknown:
1142	And doubt not, sir, but she will well excuse
1143	Why at this time the doors are made against you.
1144	Be ruled by me: depart in patience,
1145	And let us to the Tiger all to dinner,
1146	And about evening come yourself alone
1147	To know the reason of this strange restraint.
1148	If by strong hand you offer to break in
1149	Now in the stirring passage of the day,
1150	A vulgar comment will be made of it,
1151	And that supposed by the common rout
1152	Against your yet ungalled estimation
1153	That may with foul intrusion enter in
1154	And dwell upon your grave when you are dead;
1155	For slander lives upon succession,
1156	For ever housed where it gets possession.
1157	
1158	ANTIPHOLUS
1159	OF EPHESUS	You have prevailed: I will depart in quiet,
1160	And, in despite of mirth, mean to be merry.
1161	I know a wench of excellent discourse,
1162	Pretty and witty; wild, and yet, too, gentle:
1163	There will we dine. This woman that I mean,
1164	My wife--but, I protest, without desert--
1165	Hath oftentimes upbraided me withal:
1166	To her will we to dinner.
1167	
1168	[To Angelo]
1169	
1170	Get you home
1171	And fetch the chain; by this I know 'tis made:
1172	Bring it, I pray you, to the Porpentine;
1173	For there's the house: that chain will I bestow--
1174	Be it for nothing but to spite my wife--
1175	Upon mine hostess there: good sir, make haste.
1176	Since mine own doors refuse to entertain me,
1177	I'll knock elsewhere, to see if they'll disdain me.
1178	
1179	ANGELO	I'll meet you at that place some hour hence.
1180	
1181	ANTIPHOLUS
1182	OF EPHESUS	Do so. This jest shall cost me some expense.
1183	
1184	[Exeunt]

1189	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
1190	
1191	
1192	ACT III
1193	
1194	
1195	
1196	SCENE II	The same.
1197	
1198	
1199	[Enter LUCIANA and ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse]
1200	
1201	LUCIANA	And may it be that you have quite forgot
1202	A husband's office? shall, Antipholus.
1203	Even in the spring of love, thy love-springs rot?
1204	Shall love, in building, grow so ruinous?
1205	If you did wed my sister for her wealth,
1206	Then for her wealth's sake use her with more kindness:
1207	Or if you like elsewhere, do it by stealth;
1208	Muffle your false love with some show of blindness:
1209	Let not my sister read it in your eye;
1210	Be not thy tongue thy own shame's orator;
1211	Look sweet, be fair, become disloyalty;
1212	Apparel vice like virtue's harbinger;
1213	Bear a fair presence, though your heart be tainted;
1214	Teach sin the carriage of a holy saint;
1215	Be secret-false: what need she be acquainted?
1216	What simple thief brags of his own attaint?
1217	'Tis double wrong, to truant with your bed
1218	And let her read it in thy looks at board:
1219	Shame hath a bastard fame, well managed;
1220	Ill deeds are doubled with an evil word.
1221	Alas, poor women! make us but believe,
1222	Being compact of credit, that you love us;
1223	Though others have the arm, show us the sleeve;
1224	We in your motion turn and you may move us.
1225	Then, gentle brother, get you in again;
1226	Comfort my sister, cheer her, call her wife:
1227	'Tis holy sport to be a little vain,
1228	When the sweet breath of flattery conquers strife.
1229	
1230	ANTIPHOLUS
1231	OF SYRACUSE	Sweet mistress--what your name is else, I know not,
1232	Nor by what wonder you do hit of mine,--
1233	Less in your knowledge and your grace you show not
1234	Than our earth's wonder, more than earth divine.
1235	Teach me, dear creature, how to think and speak;
1236	Lay open to my earthy-gross conceit,
1237	Smother'd in errors, feeble, shallow, weak,
1238	The folded meaning of your words' deceit.
1239	Against my soul's pure truth why labour you
1240	To make it wander in an unknown field?
1241	Are you a god? would you create me new?
1242	Transform me then, and to your power I'll yield.
1243	But if that I am I, then well I know
1244	Your weeping sister is no wife of mine,
1245	Nor to her bed no homage do I owe
1246	Far more, far more to you do I decline.
1247	O, train me not, sweet mermaid, with thy note,
1248	To drown me in thy sister's flood of tears:
1249	Sing, siren, for thyself and I will dote:
1250	Spread o'er the silver waves thy golden hairs,
1251	And as a bed I'll take them and there lie,
1252	And in that glorious supposition think
1253	He gains by death that hath such means to die:
1254	Let Love, being light, be drowned if she sink!
1255	
1256	LUCIANA	What, are you mad, that you do reason so?
1257	
1258	ANTIPHOLUS
1259	OF SYRACUSE	Not mad, but mated; how, I do not know.
1260	
1261	LUCIANA	It is a fault that springeth from your eye.
1262	
1263	ANTIPHOLUS
1264	OF SYRACUSE	For gazing on your beams, fair sun, being by.
1265	
1266	LUCIANA	Gaze where you should, and that will clear your sight.
1267	
1268	ANTIPHOLUS
1269	OF SYRACUSE	As good to wink, sweet love, as look on night.
1270	
1271	
1272	LUCIANA	Why call you me love? call my sister so.
1273	
1274	ANTIPHOLUS
1275	OF SYRACUSE	Thy sister's sister.
1276	
1277	
1278	LUCIANA	That's my sister.
1279	
1280	ANTIPHOLUS
1281	OF SYRACUSE	No;
1282	It is thyself, mine own self's better part,
1283	Mine eye's clear eye, my dear heart's dearer heart,
1284	My food, my fortune and my sweet hope's aim,
1285	My sole earth's heaven and my heaven's claim.
1286	
1287	LUCIANA	All this my sister is, or else should be.
1288	
1289	ANTIPHOLUS
1290	OF SYRACUSE	Call thyself sister, sweet, for I am thee.
1291	Thee will I love and with thee lead my life:
1292	Thou hast no husband yet nor I no wife.
1293	Give me thy hand.
1294	
1295	LUCIANA	                  O, soft, air! hold you still:
1296	I'll fetch my sister, to get her good will.
1297	
1298	[Exit]
1299	
1300	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]
1301	
1302	ANTIPHOLUS
1303	OF SYRACUSE	Why, how now, Dromio! where runn'st thou so fast?
1304	
1305	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Do you know me, sir? am I Dromio? am I your man?
1306	am I myself?
1307	
1308	ANTIPHOLUS
1309	OF SYRACUSE	Thou art Dromio, thou art my man, thou art thyself.
1310	
1311	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I am an ass, I am a woman's man and besides myself.
1312	
1313	ANTIPHOLUS	What woman's man? and how besides thyself? besides thyself?
1314	
1315	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, besides myself, I am due to a woman; one
1316	that claims me, one that haunts me, one that will have me.
1317	
1318	ANTIPHOLUS
1319	OF SYRACUSE	What claim lays she to thee?
1320	
1321	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry sir, such claim as you would lay to your
1322	horse; and she would have me as a beast: not that, I
1323	being a beast, she would have me; but that she,
1324	being a very beastly creature, lays claim to me.
1325	
1326	ANTIPHOLUS
1327	OF SYRACUSE	What is she?
1328	
1329	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	A very reverent body; ay, such a one as a man may
1330	not speak of without he say 'Sir-reverence.' I have
1331	but lean luck in the match, and yet is she a
1332	wondrous fat marriage.
1333	
1334	ANTIPHOLUS
1335	OF SYRACUSE	How dost thou mean a fat marriage?
1336	
1337	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, sir, she's the kitchen wench and all grease;
1338	and I know not what use to put her to but to make a
1339	lamp of her and run from her by her own light. I
1340	warrant, her rags and the tallow in them will burn a
1341	Poland winter: if she lives till doomsday,
1342	she'll burn a week longer than the whole world.
1343	
1344	ANTIPHOLUS
1345	OF SYRACUSE	What complexion is she of?
1346	
1347	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Swart, like my shoe, but her face nothing half so
1348	clean kept: for why, she sweats; a man may go over
1349	shoes in the grime of it.
1350	
1351	ANTIPHOLUS
1352	OF SYRACUSE	That's a fault that water will mend.
1353	
1354	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, sir, 'tis in grain; Noah's flood could not do it.
1355	
1356	ANTIPHOLUS
1357	OF SYRACUSE	What's her name?
1358	
1359	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nell, sir; but her name and three quarters, that's
1360	an ell and three quarters, will not measure her from
1361	hip to hip.
1362	
1363	ANTIPHOLUS
1364	OF SYRACUSE	Then she bears some breadth?
1365	
1366	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No longer from head to foot than from hip to hip:
1367	she is spherical, like a globe; I could find out
1368	countries in her.
1369	
1370	ANTIPHOLUS
1371	OF SYRACUSE	In what part of her body stands Ireland?
1372	
1373	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, in her buttocks: I found it out by the bogs.
1374	
1375	ANTIPHOLUS
1376	OF SYRACUSE	Where Scotland?
1377	
1378	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I found it by the barrenness; hard in the palm of the hand.
1379	
1380	ANTIPHOLUS
1381	OF SYRACUSE	Where France?
1382	
1383	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	In her forehead; armed and reverted, making war
1384	against her heir.
1385	
1386	ANTIPHOLUS
1387	OF SYRACUSE	Where England?
1388	
1389	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I looked for the chalky cliffs, but I could find no
1390	whiteness in them; but I guess it stood in her chin,
1391	by the salt rheum that ran between France and it.
1392	
1393	ANTIPHOLUS
1394	OF SYRACUSE	Where Spain?
1395	
1396	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Faith, I saw it not; but I felt it hot in her breath.
1397	
1398	ANTIPHOLUS
1399	OF SYRACUSE	Where America, the Indies?
1400	
1401	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Oh, sir, upon her nose all o'er embellished with
1402	rubies, carbuncles, sapphires, declining their rich
1403	aspect to the hot breath of Spain; who sent whole
1404	armadoes of caracks to be ballast at her nose.
1405	
1406	ANTIPHOLUS
1407	OF SYRACUSE	Where stood Belgia, the Netherlands?
1408	
1409	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Oh, sir, I did not look so low. To conclude, this
1410	drudge, or diviner, laid claim to me, call'd me
1411	Dromio; swore I was assured to her; told me what
1412	privy marks I had about me, as, the mark of my
1413	shoulder, the mole in my neck, the great wart on my
1414	left arm, that I amazed ran from her as a witch:
1415	And, I think, if my breast had not been made of
1416	faith and my heart of steel,
1417	She had transform'd me to a curtal dog and made
1418	me turn i' the wheel.
1419	
1420	ANTIPHOLUS
1421	OF SYRACUSE	Go hie thee presently, post to the road:
1422	An if the wind blow any way from shore,
1423	I will not harbour in this town to-night:
1424	If any bark put forth, come to the mart,
1425	Where I will walk till thou return to me.
1426	If every one knows us and we know none,
1427	'Tis time, I think, to trudge, pack and be gone.
1428	
1429	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	As from a bear a man would run for life,
1430	So fly I from her that would be my wife.
1431	
1432	[Exit]
1433	
1434	ANTIPHOLUS
1435	OF SYRACUSE	There's none but witches do inhabit here;
1436	And therefore 'tis high time that I were hence.
1437	She that doth call me husband, even my soul
1438	Doth for a wife abhor. But her fair sister,
1439	Possess'd with such a gentle sovereign grace,
1440	Of such enchanting presence and discourse,
1441	Hath almost made me traitor to myself:
1442	But, lest myself be guilty to self-wrong,
1443	I'll stop mine ears against the mermaid's song.
1444	
1445	[Enter ANGELO with the chain]
1446	
1447	ANGELO	Master Antipholus,--
1448	
1449	ANTIPHOLUS
1450	OF SYRACUSE	Ay, that's my name.
1451	
1452	ANGELO	I know it well, sir, lo, here is the chain.
1453	I thought to have ta'en you at the Porpentine:
1454	The chain unfinish'd made me stay thus long.
1455	
1456	ANTIPHOLUS
1457	OF SYRACUSE	What is your will that I shall do with this?
1458	
1459	ANGELO	What please yourself, sir: I have made it for you.
1460	
1461	ANTIPHOLUS
1462	OF SYRACUSE	Made it for me, sir! I bespoke it not.
1463	
1464	ANGELO	Not once, nor twice, but twenty times you have.
1465	Go home with it and please your wife withal;
1466	And soon at supper-time I'll visit you
1467	And then receive my money for the chain.
1468	
1469	ANTIPHOLUS
1470	OF SYRACUSE	I pray you, sir, receive the money now,
1471	For fear you ne'er see chain nor money more.
1472	
1473	ANGELO	You are a merry man, sir: fare you well.
1474	
1475	[Exit]
1476	
1477	ANTIPHOLUS
1478	OF SYRACUSE	What I should think of this, I cannot tell:
1479	But this I think, there's no man is so vain
1480	That would refuse so fair an offer'd chain.
1481	I see a man here needs not live by shifts,
1482	When in the streets he meets such golden gifts.
1483	I'll to the mart, and there for Dromio stay
1484	If any ship put out, then straight away.
1485	
1486	[Exit]

1491	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
1492	
1493	
1494	ACT IV
1495	
1496	
1497	
1498	SCENE I	A public place.
1499	
1500	
1501	[Enter Second Merchant, ANGELO, and an Officer]
1502	
1503	Second Merchant	You know since Pentecost the sum is due,
1504	And since I have not much importuned you;
1505	Nor now I had not, but that I am bound
1506	To Persia, and want guilders for my voyage:
1507	Therefore make present satisfaction,
1508	Or I'll attach you by this officer.
1509	
1510	ANGELO	Even just the sum that I do owe to you
1511	Is growing to me by Antipholus,
1512	And in the instant that I met with you
1513	He had of me a chain: at five o'clock
1514	I shall receive the money for the same.
1515	Pleaseth you walk with me down to his house,
1516	I will discharge my bond and thank you too.
1517	
1518	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus
1519	from the courtezan's]
1520	
1521	Officer	That labour may you save: see where he comes.
1522	
1523	ANTIPHOLUS
1524	OF EPHESUS	While I go to the goldsmith's house, go thou
1525	And buy a rope's end: that will I bestow
1526	Among my wife and her confederates,
1527	For locking me out of my doors by day.
1528	But, soft! I see the goldsmith. Get thee gone;
1529	Buy thou a rope and bring it home to me.
1530	
1531	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I buy a thousand pound a year: I buy a rope.
1532	
1533	[Exit]
1534	
1535	ANTIPHOLUS
1536	OF EPHESUS	A man is well holp up that trusts to you:
1537	I promised your presence and the chain;
1538	But neither chain nor goldsmith came to me.
1539	Belike you thought our love would last too long,
1540	If it were chain'd together, and therefore came not.
1541	
1542	ANGELO	Saving your merry humour, here's the note
1543	How much your chain weighs to the utmost carat,
1544	The fineness of the gold and chargeful fashion.
1545	Which doth amount to three odd ducats more
1546	Than I stand debted to this gentleman:
1547	I pray you, see him presently discharged,
1548	For he is bound to sea and stays but for it.
1549	
1550	ANTIPHOLUS
1551	OF EPHESUS	I am not furnish'd with the present money;
1552	Besides, I have some business in the town.
1553	Good signior, take the stranger to my house
1554	And with you take the chain and bid my wife
1555	Disburse the sum on the receipt thereof:
1556	Perchance I will be there as soon as you.
1557	
1558	ANGELO	Then you will bring the chain to her yourself?
1559	
1560	ANTIPHOLUS
1561	OF EPHESUS	No; bear it with you, lest I come not time enough.
1562	
1563	ANGELO	Well, sir, I will. Have you the chain about you?
1564	
1565	ANTIPHOLUS
1566	OF EPHESUS	An if I have not, sir, I hope you have;
1567	Or else you may return without your money.
1568	
1569	ANGELO	Nay, come, I pray you, sir, give me the chain:
1570	Both wind and tide stays for this gentleman,
1571	And I, to blame, have held him here too long.
1572	
1573	ANTIPHOLUS
1574	OF EPHESUS	Good Lord! you use this dalliance to excuse
1575	Your breach of promise to the Porpentine.
1576	I should have chid you for not bringing it,
1577	But, like a shrew, you first begin to brawl.
1578	
1579	Second Merchant	The hour steals on; I pray you, sir, dispatch.
1580	
1581	ANGELO	You hear how he importunes me;--the chain!
1582	
1583	ANTIPHOLUS
1584	OF EPHESUS	Why, give it to my wife and fetch your money.
1585	
1586	ANGELO	Come, come, you know I gave it you even now.
1587	Either send the chain or send me by some token.
1588	
1589	ANTIPHOLUS
1590	OF EPHESUS	Fie, now you run this humour out of breath,
1591	where's the chain? I pray you, let me see it.
1592	
1593	Second Merchant	My business cannot brook this dalliance.
1594	Good sir, say whether you'll answer me or no:
1595	If not, I'll leave him to the officer.
1596	
1597	ANTIPHOLUS
1598	OF EPHESUS	I answer you! what should I answer you?
1599	
1600	ANGELO	The money that you owe me for the chain.
1601	
1602	ANTIPHOLUS
1603	OF EPHESUS	I owe you none till I receive the chain.
1604	
1605	ANGELO	You know I gave it you half an hour since.
1606	
1607	ANTIPHOLUS
1608	OF EPHESUS	You gave me none: you wrong me much to say so.
1609	
1610	ANGELO	You wrong me more, sir, in denying it:
1611	Consider how it stands upon my credit.
1612	
1613	Second Merchant	Well, officer, arrest him at my suit.
1614	
1615	Officer	I do; and charge you in the duke's name to obey me.
1616	
1617	ANGELO	This touches me in reputation.
1618	Either consent to pay this sum for me
1619	Or I attach you by this officer.
1620	
1621	ANTIPHOLUS
1622	OF EPHESUS	Consent to pay thee that I never had!
1623	Arrest me, foolish fellow, if thou darest.
1624	
1625	ANGELO	Here is thy fee; arrest him, officer,
1626	I would not spare my brother in this case,
1627	If he should scorn me so apparently.
1628	
1629	Officer	I do arrest you, sir: you hear the suit.
1630	
1631	ANTIPHOLUS
1632	OF EPHESUS	I do obey thee till I give thee bail.
1633	But, sirrah, you shall buy this sport as dear
1634	As all the metal in your shop will answer.
1635	
1636	ANGELO	Sir, sir, I will have law in Ephesus,
1637	To your notorious shame; I doubt it not.
1638	
1639	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse, from the bay]
1640	
1641	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, there is a bark of Epidamnum
1642	That stays but till her owner comes aboard,
1643	And then, sir, she bears away. Our fraughtage, sir,
1644	I have convey'd aboard; and I have bought
1645	The oil, the balsamum and aqua-vitae.
1646	The ship is in her trim; the merry wind
1647	Blows fair from land: they stay for nought at all
1648	But for their owner, master, and yourself.
1649	
1650	ANTIPHOLUS
1651	OF EPHESUS	How now! a madman! Why, thou peevish sheep,
1652	What ship of Epidamnum stays for me?
1653	
1654	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	A ship you sent me to, to hire waftage.
1655	
1656	ANTIPHOLUS
1657	OF EPHESUS	Thou drunken slave, I sent thee for a rope;
1658	And told thee to what purpose and what end.
1659	
1660	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	You sent me for a rope's end as soon:
1661	You sent me to the bay, sir, for a bark.
1662	
1663	ANTIPHOLUS
1664	OF EPHESUS	I will debate this matter at more leisure
1665	And teach your ears to list me with more heed.
1666	To Adriana, villain, hie thee straight:
1667	Give her this key, and tell her, in the desk
1668	That's cover'd o'er with Turkish tapestry,
1669	There is a purse of ducats; let her send it:
1670	Tell her I am arrested in the street
1671	And that shall bail me; hie thee, slave, be gone!
1672	On, officer, to prison till it come.
1673	
1674	[Exeunt Second Merchant, Angelo, Officer, and
1675	Antipholus of Ephesus]
1676	
1677	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	To Adriana! that is where we dined,
1678	Where Dowsabel did claim me for her husband:
1679	She is too big, I hope, for me to compass.
1680	Thither I must, although against my will,
1681	For servants must their masters' minds fulfil.

1696	
1697	
1698	[Enter ADRIANA and LUCIANA]
1699	
1700	ADRIANA	Ah, Luciana, did he tempt thee so?
1701	Mightst thou perceive austerely in his eye
1702	That he did plead in earnest? yea or no?
1703	Look'd he or red or pale, or sad or merrily?
1704	What observation madest thou in this case
1705	Of his heart's meteors tilting in his face?
1706	
1707	LUCIANA	First he denied you had in him no right.
1708	
1709	ADRIANA	He meant he did me none; the more my spite.
1710	
1711	LUCIANA	Then swore he that he was a stranger here.
1712	
1713	ADRIANA	And true he swore, though yet forsworn he were.
1714	
1715	LUCIANA	Then pleaded I for you.
1716	
1717	ADRIANA	And what said he?
1718	
1719	LUCIANA	That love I begg'd for you he begg'd of me.
1720	
1721	ADRIANA	With what persuasion did he tempt thy love?
1722	
1723	LUCIANA	With words that in an honest suit might move.
1724	First he did praise my beauty, then my speech.
1725	
1726	ADRIANA	Didst speak him fair?
1727	
1728	LUCIANA	Have patience, I beseech.
1729	
1730	ADRIANA	I cannot, nor I will not, hold me still;
1731	My tongue, though not my heart, shall have his will.
1732	He is deformed, crooked, old and sere,
1733	Ill-faced, worse bodied, shapeless everywhere;
1734	Vicious, ungentle, foolish, blunt, unkind;
1735	Stigmatical in making, worse in mind.
1736	
1737	LUCIANA	Who would be jealous then of such a one?
1738	No evil lost is wail'd when it is gone.
1739	
1740	ADRIANA	Ah, but I think him better than I say,
1741	And yet would herein others' eyes were worse.
1742	Far from her nest the lapwing cries away:
1743	My heart prays for him, though my tongue do curse.
1744	
1745	[Enter DROMIO of Syracuse]
1746	
1747	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Here! go; the desk, the purse! sweet, now, make haste.
1748	
1749	LUCIANA	How hast thou lost thy breath?
1750	
1751	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	By running fast.
1752	
1753	ADRIANA	Where is thy master, Dromio? is he well?
1754	
1755	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, he's in Tartar limbo, worse than hell.
1756	A devil in an everlasting garment hath him;
1757	One whose hard heart is button'd up with steel;
1758	A fiend, a fury, pitiless and rough;
1759	A wolf, nay, worse, a fellow all in buff;
1760	A back-friend, a shoulder-clapper, one that
1761	countermands
1762	The passages of alleys, creeks and narrow lands;
1763	A hound that runs counter and yet draws dryfoot well;
1764	One that before the judgement carries poor souls to hell.
1765	
1766	ADRIANA	Why, man, what is the matter?
1767	
1768	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I do not know the matter: he is 'rested on the case.
1769	
1770	ADRIANA	What, is he arrested? Tell me at whose suit.
1771	
1772	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I know not at whose suit he is arrested well;
1773	But he's in a suit of buff which 'rested him, that can I tell.
1774	Will you send him, mistress, redemption, the money in his desk?
1775	
1776	ADRIANA	Go fetch it, sister.
1777	
1778	[Exit Luciana]
1779	
1780	This I wonder at,
1781	That he, unknown to me, should be in debt.
1782	Tell me, was he arrested on a band?
1783	
1784	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not on a band, but on a stronger thing;
1785	A chain, a chain! Do you not hear it ring?
1786	
1787	ADRIANA	What, the chain?
1788	
1789	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No, no, the bell: 'tis time that I were gone:
1790	It was two ere I left him, and now the clock
1791	strikes one.
1792	
1793	ADRIANA	The hours come back! that did I never hear.
1794	
1795	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, yes; if any hour meet a sergeant, a' turns back for
1796	very fear.
1797	
1798	ADRIANA	As if Time were in debt! how fondly dost thou reason!
1799	
1800	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Time is a very bankrupt, and owes more than he's
1801	worth, to season.
1802	Nay, he's a thief too: have you not heard men say
1803	That Time comes stealing on by night and day?
1804	If Time be in debt and theft, and a sergeant in the way,
1805	Hath he not reason to turn back an hour in a day?
1806	
1807	[Re-enter LUCIANA with a purse]
1808	
1809	ADRIANA	Go, Dromio; there's the money, bear it straight;
1810	And bring thy master home immediately.
1811	Come, sister: I am press'd down with conceit--
1812	Conceit, my comfort and my injury.

1827	
1828	
1829	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse]
1830	
1831	ANTIPHOLUS
1832	OF SYRACUSE	There's not a man I meet but doth salute me
1833	As if I were their well-acquainted friend;
1834	And every one doth call me by my name.
1835	Some tender money to me; some invite me;
1836	Some other give me thanks for kindnesses;
1837	Some offer me commodities to buy:
1838	Even now a tailor call'd me in his shop
1839	And show'd me silks that he had bought for me,
1840	And therewithal took measure of my body.
1841	Sure, these are but imaginary wiles
1842	And Lapland sorcerers inhabit here.
1843	
1844	[Enter DROMIO OF SYRACUSE]
1845	
1846	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, here's the gold you sent me for. What, have
1847	you got the picture of old Adam new-apparelled?
1848	
1849	ANTIPHOLUS
1850	OF SYRACUSE	What gold is this? what Adam dost thou mean?
1851	
1852	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not that Adam that kept the Paradise but that Adam
1853	that keeps the prison: he that goes in the calf's
1854	skin that was killed for the Prodigal; he that came
1855	behind you, sir, like an evil angel, and bid you
1856	forsake your liberty.
1857	
1858	ANTIPHOLUS
1859	OF SYRACUSE	I understand thee not.
1860	
1861	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	No? why, 'tis a plain case: he that went, like a
1862	bass-viol, in a case of leather; the man, sir,
1863	that, when gentlemen are tired, gives them a sob
1864	and 'rests them; he, sir, that takes pity on decayed
1865	men and gives them suits of durance; he that sets up
1866	his rest to do more exploits with his mace than a
1867	morris-pike.
1868	
1869	ANTIPHOLUS
1870	OF SYRACUSE	What, thou meanest an officer?
1871	
1872	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Ay, sir, the sergeant of the band, he that brings
1873	any man to answer it that breaks his band; one that
1874	thinks a man always going to bed, and says, 'God
1875	give you good rest!'
1876	
1877	ANTIPHOLUS
1878	OF SYRACUSE	Well, sir, there rest in your foolery. Is there any
1879	
1880	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Why, sir, I brought you word an hour since that the
1881	bark Expedition put forth to-night; and then were
1882	you hindered by the sergeant, to tarry for the hoy
1883	Delay. Here are the angels that you sent for to
1884	deliver you.
1885	
1886	ANTIPHOLUS
1887	OF SYRACUSE	The fellow is distract, and so am I;
1888	And here we wander in illusions:
1889	Some blessed power deliver us from hence!
1890	
1891	[Enter a Courtezan]
1892	
1893	Courtezan	Well met, well met, Master Antipholus.
1894	I see, sir, you have found the goldsmith now:
1895	Is that the chain you promised me to-day?
1896	
1897	ANTIPHOLUS
1898	OF SYRACUSE	Satan, avoid! I charge thee, tempt me not.
1899	
1900	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, is this Mistress Satan?
1901	
1902	ANTIPHOLUS
1903	OF SYRACUSE	It is the devil.
1904	
1905	
1906	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Nay, she is worse, she is the devil's dam; and here
1907	she comes in the habit of a light wench: and thereof
1908	comes that the wenches say 'God damn me;' that's as
1909	much to say 'God make me a light wench.' It is
1910	written, they appear to men like angels of light:
1911	light is an effect of fire, and fire will burn;
1912	ergo, light wenches will burn. Come not near her.
1913	
1914	Courtezan	Your man and you are marvellous merry, sir.
1915	Will you go with me? We'll mend our dinner here?
1916	
1917	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, if you do, expect spoon-meat; or bespeak a
1918	long spoon.
1919	
1920	ANTIPHOLUS
1921	OF SYRACUSE	Why, Dromio?
1922	
1923	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Marry, he must have a long spoon that must eat with
1924	the devil.
1925	
1926	ANTIPHOLUS
1927	OF SYRACUSE	Avoid then, fiend! what tell'st thou me of supping?
1928	Thou art, as you are all, a sorceress:
1929	I conjure thee to leave me and be gone.
1930	
1931	Courtezan	Give me the ring of mine you had at dinner,
1932	Or, for my diamond, the chain you promised,
1933	And I'll be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
1934	
1935	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Some devils ask but the parings of one's nail,
1936	A rush, a hair, a drop of blood, a pin,
1937	A nut, a cherry-stone;
1938	But she, more covetous, would have a chain.
1939	Master, be wise: an if you give it her,
1940	The devil will shake her chain and fright us with it.
1941	
1942	Courtezan	I pray you, sir, my ring, or else the chain:
1943	I hope you do not mean to cheat me so.
1944	
1945	ANTIPHOLUS
1946	OF SYRACUSE	Avaunt, thou witch! Come, Dromio, let us go.
1947	
1948	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	'Fly pride,' says the peacock: mistress, that you know.
1949	
1950	[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse]
1951	
1952	Courtezan	Now, out of doubt Antipholus is mad,
1953	Else would he never so demean himself.
1954	A ring he hath of mine worth forty ducats,
1955	And for the same he promised me a chain:
1956	Both one and other he denies me now.
1957	The reason that I gather he is mad,
1958	Besides this present instance of his rage,
1959	Is a mad tale he told to-day at dinner,
1960	Of his own doors being shut against his entrance.
1961	Belike his wife, acquainted with his fits,
1962	On purpose shut the doors against his way.
1963	My way is now to hie home to his house,
1964	And tell his wife that, being lunatic,
1965	He rush'd into my house and took perforce
1966	My ring away. This course I fittest choose;
1967	For forty ducats is too much to lose.

1987	OF EPHESUS	Fear me not, man; I will not break away:
1988	I'll give thee, ere I leave thee, so much money,
1989	To warrant thee, as I am 'rested for.
1990	My wife is in a wayward mood to-day,
1991	And will not lightly trust the messenger
1992	That I should be attach'd in Ephesus,
1993	I tell you, 'twill sound harshly in her ears.
1994	
1995	[Enter DROMIO of Ephesus with a rope's-end]
1996	
1997	Here comes my man; I think he brings the money.
1998	How now, sir! have you that I sent you for?
1999	
2000	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Here's that, I warrant you, will pay them all.
2001	
2002	ANTIPHOLUS
2003	OF EPHESUS	But where's the money?
2004	
2005	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Why, sir, I gave the money for the rope.
2006	
2007	ANTIPHOLUS
2008	OF EPHESUS	Five hundred ducats, villain, for a rope?
2009	
2010	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I'll serve you, sir, five hundred at the rate.
2011	
2012	ANTIPHOLUS
2013	OF EPHESUS	To what end did I bid thee hie thee home?
2014	
2015	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	To a rope's-end, sir; and to that end am I returned.
2016	
2017	ANTIPHOLUS
2018	OF EPHESUS	And to that end, sir, I will welcome you.

2020	[Beating him]
2021	
2022	Officer	Good sir, be patient.
2023	
2024	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, 'tis for me to be patient; I am in adversity.
2025	
2026	Officer	Good, now, hold thy tongue.
2027	
2028	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, rather persuade him to hold his hands.
2029	
2030	ANTIPHOLUS
2031	OF EPHESUS	Thou whoreson, senseless villain!
2032	
2033	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I would I were senseless, sir, that I might not feel
2034	your blows.
2035	
2036	ANTIPHOLUS	Thou art sensible in nothing but blows, and so is an
2037	ass.
2038	
2039	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I am an ass, indeed; you may prove it by my long
2040	ears. I have served him from the hour of my
2041	nativity to this instant, and have nothing at his
2042	hands for my service but blows. When I am cold, he
2043	heats me with beating; when I am warm, he cools me
2044	with beating; I am waked with it when I sleep;
2045	raised with it when I sit; driven out of doors with
2046	it when I go from home; welcomed home with it when
2047	I return; nay, I bear it on my shoulders, as a
2048	beggar wont her brat; and, I think when he hath
2049	lamed me, I shall beg with it from door to door.
2050	
2051	ANTIPHOLUS

2070	And I will please you what you will demand.

2094	OF EPHESUS	You minion, you, are these your customers?
2095	Did this companion with the saffron face
2096	Revel and feast it at my house to-day,
2097	Whilst upon me the guilty doors were shut
2098	And I denied to enter in my house?
2099	
2100	ADRIANA	O husband, God doth know you dined at home;
2101	Where would you had remain'd until this time,
2102	Free from these slanders and this open shame!
2103	
2104	ANTIPHOLUS
2105	OF EPHESUS	Dined at home! Thou villain, what sayest thou?
2106	
2107	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sir, sooth to say, you did not dine at home.
2108	
2109	ANTIPHOLUS
2110	OF EPHESUS	Were not my doors lock'd up and I shut out?
2111	
2112	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Perdie, your doors were lock'd and you shut out.
2113	
2114	ANTIPHOLUS
2115	OF EPHESUS	And did not she herself revile me there?
2116	
2117	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sans fable, she herself reviled you there.
2118	
2119	ANTIPHOLUS
2120	OF EPHESUS	Did not her kitchen-maid rail, taunt, and scorn me?
2121	
2122	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Certes, she did; the kitchen-vestal scorn'd you.
2123	
2124	ANTIPHOLUS
2125	OF EPHESUS	And did not I in rage depart from thence?
2126	
2127	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	In verity you did; my bones bear witness,
2128	That since have felt the vigour of his rage.
2129	
2130	ADRIANA	Is't good to soothe him in these contraries?
2131	
2132	PINCH	It is no shame: the fellow finds his vein,
2133	And yielding to him humours well his frenzy.
2134	
2135	ANTIPHOLUS
2136	OF EPHESUS	Thou hast suborn'd the goldsmith to arrest me.
2137	
2138	ADRIANA	Alas, I sent you money to redeem you,
2139	By Dromio here, who came in haste for it.
2140	
2141	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Money by me! heart and goodwill you might;
2142	But surely master, not a rag of money.
2143	
2144	ANTIPHOLUS
2145	OF EPHESUS	Went'st not thou to her for a purse of ducats?
2146	
2147	ADRIANA	He came to me and I deliver'd it.
2148	
2149	LUCIANA	And I am witness with her that she did.
2150	
2151	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	God and the rope-maker bear me witness
2152	That I was sent for nothing but a rope!
2153	
2154	PINCH	Mistress, both man and master is possess'd;
2155	I know it by their pale and deadly looks:
2156	They must be bound and laid in some dark room.
2157	
2158	ANTIPHOLUS
2159	OF EPHESUS	Say, wherefore didst thou lock me forth to-day?
2160	And why dost thou deny the bag of gold?
2161	
2162	ADRIANA	I did not, gentle husband, lock thee forth.
2163	
2164	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And, gentle master, I received no gold;
2165	But I confess, sir, that we were lock'd out.
2166	
2167	ADRIANA	Dissembling villain, thou speak'st false in both.
2168	
2169	ANTIPHOLUS
2170	OF EPHESUS	Dissembling harlot, thou art false in all;
2171	And art confederate with a damned pack
2172	To make a loathsome abject scorn of me:
2173	But with these nails I'll pluck out these false eyes
2174	That would behold in me this shameful sport.
2175	
2176	[Enter three or four, and offer to bind him.
2177	He strives]
2178	
2179	ADRIANA	O, bind him, bind him! let him not come near me.
2180	
2181	PINCH	More company! The fiend is strong within him.
2182	
2183	LUCIANA	Ay me, poor man, how pale and wan he looks!
2184	
2185	ANTIPHOLUS
2186	OF EPHESUS	What, will you murder me? Thou gaoler, thou,
2187	I am thy prisoner: wilt thou suffer them
2188	To make a rescue?
2189	
2190	Officer	                  Masters, let him go
2191	He is my prisoner, and you shall not have him.
2192	
2193	PINCH	Go bind this man, for he is frantic too.
2194	
2195	[They offer to bind Dromio of Ephesus]
2196	
2197	ADRIANA	What wilt thou do, thou peevish officer?
2198	Hast thou delight to see a wretched man
2199	Do outrage and displeasure to himself?
2200	
2201	Officer	He is my prisoner: if I let him go,
2202	The debt he owes will be required of me.
2203	
2204	ADRIANA	I will discharge thee ere I go from thee:
2205	Bear me forthwith unto his creditor,
2206	And, knowing how the debt grows, I will pay it.
2207	Good master doctor, see him safe convey'd
2208	Home to my house. O most unhappy day!
2209	
2210	ANTIPHOLUS
2211	OF EPHESUS	O most unhappy strumpet!
2212	
2213	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Master, I am here entered in bond for you.
2214	
2215	ANTIPHOLUS
2216	OF EPHESUS	Out on thee, villain! wherefore dost thou mad me?
2217	
2218	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Will you be bound for nothing? be mad, good master:
2219	cry 'The devil!'
2220	
2221	LUCIANA	God help, poor souls, how idly do they talk!
2222	
2223	ADRIANA	Go bear him hence. Sister, go you with me.
2224	
2225	[Exeunt all but Adriana, Luciana, Officer and
2226	Courtezan]
2227	
2228	Say now, whose suit is he arrested at?
2229	
2230	Officer	One Angelo, a goldsmith: do you know him?
2231	
2232	ADRIANA	I know the man. What is the sum he owes?
2233	
2234	Officer	Two hundred ducats.
2235	
2236	ADRIANA	Say, how grows it due?
2237	
2238	Officer	Due for a chain your husband had of him.
2239	
2240	ADRIANA	He did bespeak a chain for me, but had it not.
2241	
2242	Courtezan	When as your husband all in rage to-day
2243	Came to my house and took away my ring--
2244	The ring I saw upon his finger now--
2245	Straight after did I meet him with a chain.
2246	
2247	ADRIANA	It may be so, but I did never see it.
2248	Come, gaoler, bring me where the goldsmith is:
2249	I long to know the truth hereof at large.
2250	
2251	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse with his rapier drawn,
2252	and DROMIO of Syracuse]
2253	
2254	LUCIANA	God, for thy mercy! they are loose again.
2255	
2256	ADRIANA	And come with naked swords.
2257	Let's call more help to have them bound again.
2258	
2259	Officer	Away! they'll kill us.
2260	
2261	[Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio
2262	of Syracuse]
2263	
2264	ANTIPHOLUS
2265	OF SYRACUSE	I see these witches are afraid of swords.
2266	
2267	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	She that would be your wife now ran from you.
2268	
2269	ANTIPHOLUS
2270	OF SYRACUSE	Come to the Centaur; fetch our stuff from thence:
2271	I long that we were safe and sound aboard.
2272	
2273	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Faith, stay here this night; they will surely do us
2274	no harm: you saw they speak us fair, give us gold:
2275	methinks they are such a gentle nation that, but for
2276	the mountain of mad flesh that claims marriage of
2277	me, I could find in my heart to stay here still and
2278	turn witch.
2279	
2280	ANTIPHOLUS
2281	OF SYRACUSE	I will not stay to-night for all the town;
2282	Therefore away, to get our stuff aboard.
2283	
2284	[Exeunt]

2288	
2289	THE COMEDY OF ERRORS
2290	
2291	
2292	ACT V
2293	
2294	
2295	
2296	SCENE I	A street before a Priory.
2297	
2298	
2299	[Enter Second Merchant and ANGELO]
2300	
2301	ANGELO	I am sorry, sir, that I have hinder'd you;
2302	But, I protest, he had the chain of me,
2303	Though most dishonestly he doth deny it.
2304	
2305	Second Merchant	How is the man esteemed here in the city?
2306	
2307	ANGELO	Of very reverend reputation, sir,
2308	Of credit infinite, highly beloved,
2309	Second to none that lives here in the city:
2310	His word might bear my wealth at any time.
2311	
2312	Second Merchant	Speak softly; yonder, as I think, he walks.
2313	
2314	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and DROMIO of Syracuse]
2315	
2316	ANGELO	'Tis so; and that self chain about his neck
2317	Which he forswore most monstrously to have.
2318	Good sir, draw near to me, I'll speak to him.
2319	Signior Antipholus, I wonder much
2320	That you would put me to this shame and trouble;
2321	And, not without some scandal to yourself,
2322	With circumstance and oaths so to deny
2323	This chain which now you wear so openly:
2324	Beside the charge, the shame, imprisonment,
2325	You have done wrong to this my honest friend,
2326	Who, but for staying on our controversy,
2327	Had hoisted sail and put to sea to-day:
2328	This chain you had of me; can you deny it?
2329	
2330	ANTIPHOLUS
2331	OF SYRACUSE	I think I had; I never did deny it.
2332	
2333	Second Merchant	Yes, that you did, sir, and forswore it too.
2334	
2335	ANTIPHOLUS
2336	OF SYRACUSE	Who heard me to deny it or forswear it?
2337	
2338	Second Merchant	These ears of mine, thou know'st did hear thee.
2339	Fie on thee, wretch! 'tis pity that thou livest
2340	To walk where any honest man resort.
2341	
2342	ANTIPHOLUS
2343	OF SYRACUSE	Thou art a villain to impeach me thus:
2344	I'll prove mine honour and mine honesty
2345	Against thee presently, if thou darest stand.
2346	
2347	Second Merchant	I dare, and do defy thee for a villain.
2348	
2349	[They draw]
2350	
2351	[Enter ADRIANA, LUCIANA, the Courtezan, and others]
2352	
2353	ADRIANA	Hold, hurt him not, for God's sake! he is mad.
2354	Some get within him, take his sword away:
2355	Bind Dromio too, and bear them to my house.
2356	
2357	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Run, master, run; for God's sake, take a house!
2358	This is some priory. In, or we are spoil'd!
2359	
2360	[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Dromio of Syracuse
2361	to the Priory]
2362	
2363	[Enter the Lady Abbess, AEMILIA]
2364	
2365	AEMELIA	Be quiet, people. Wherefore throng you hither?
2366	
2367	ADRIANA	To fetch my poor distracted husband hence.
2368	Let us come in, that we may bind him fast
2369	And bear him home for his recovery.
2370	
2371	ANGELO	I knew he was not in his perfect wits.
2372	
2373	Second Merchant	I am sorry now that I did draw on him.
2374	
2375	AEMELIA	How long hath this possession held the man?
2376	
2377	ADRIANA	This week he hath been heavy, sour, sad,
2378	And much different from the man he was;
2379	But till this afternoon his passion
2380	Ne'er brake into extremity of rage.
2381	
2382	AEMELIA	Hath he not lost much wealth by wreck of sea?
2383	Buried some dear friend? Hath not else his eye
2384	Stray'd his affection in unlawful love?
2385	A sin prevailing much in youthful men,
2386	Who give their eyes the liberty of gazing.
2387	Which of these sorrows is he subject to?
2388	
2389	ADRIANA	To none of these, except it be the last;
2390	Namely, some love that drew him oft from home.
2391	
2392	AEMELIA	You should for that have reprehended him.
2393	
2394	ADRIANA	Why, so I did.
2395	
2396	AEMELIA	                  Ay, but not rough enough.
2397	
2398	ADRIANA	As roughly as my modesty would let me.
2399	
2400	AEMELIA	Haply, in private.
2401	
2402	ADRIANA	And in assemblies too.
2403	
2404	AEMELIA	Ay, but not enough.
2405	
2406	ADRIANA	It was the copy of our conference:
2407	In bed he slept not for my urging it;
2408	At board he fed not for my urging it;
2409	Alone, it was the subject of my theme;
2410	In company I often glanced it;
2411	Still did I tell him it was vile and bad.
2412	
2413	AEMELIA	And thereof came it that the man was mad.
2414	The venom clamours of a jealous woman
2415	Poisons more deadly than a mad dog's tooth.
2416	It seems his sleeps were hinder'd by thy railing,
2417	And therefore comes it that his head is light.
2418	Thou say'st his meat was sauced with thy upbraidings:
2419	Unquiet meals make ill digestions;
2420	Thereof the raging fire of fever bred;
2421	And what's a fever but a fit of madness?
2422	Thou say'st his sports were hinderd by thy brawls:
2423	Sweet recreation barr'd, what doth ensue
2424	But moody and dull melancholy,
2425	Kinsman to grim and comfortless despair,
2426	And at her heels a huge infectious troop
2427	Of pale distemperatures and foes to life?
2428	In food, in sport and life-preserving rest
2429	To be disturb'd, would mad or man or beast:
2430	The consequence is then thy jealous fits
2431	Have scared thy husband from the use of wits.
2432	
2433	LUCIANA	She never reprehended him but mildly,
2434	When he demean'd himself rough, rude and wildly.
2435	Why bear you these rebukes and answer not?
2436	
2437	ADRIANA	She did betray me to my own reproof.
2438	Good people enter and lay hold on him.
2439	
2440	AEMELIA	No, not a creature enters in my house.
2441	
2442	ADRIANA	Then let your servants bring my husband forth.
2443	
2444	AEMELIA	Neither: he took this place for sanctuary,
2445	And it shall privilege him from your hands
2446	Till I have brought him to his wits again,
2447	Or lose my labour in assaying it.
2448	
2449	ADRIANA	I will attend my husband, be his nurse,
2450	Diet his sickness, for it is my office,
2451	And will have no attorney but myself;
2452	And therefore let me have him home with me.
2453	
2454	AEMELIA	Be patient; for I will not let him stir
2455	Till I have used the approved means I have,
2456	With wholesome syrups, drugs and holy prayers,
2457	To make of him a formal man again:
2458	It is a branch and parcel of mine oath,
2459	A charitable duty of my order.
2460	Therefore depart and leave him here with me.
2461	
2462	ADRIANA	I will not hence and leave my husband here:
2463	And ill it doth beseem your holiness
2464	To separate the husband and the wife.
2465	
2466	AEMELIA	Be quiet and depart: thou shalt not have him.
2467	
2468	[Exit]
2469	
2470	LUCIANA	Complain unto the duke of this indignity.
2471	
2472	ADRIANA	Come, go: I will fall prostrate at his feet
2473	And never rise until my tears and prayers
2474	Have won his grace to come in person hither
2475	And take perforce my husband from the abbess.
2476	
2477	Second Merchant	By this, I think, the dial points at five:
2478	Anon, I'm sure, the duke himself in person
2479	Comes this way to the melancholy vale,
2480	The place of death and sorry execution,
2481	Behind the ditches of the abbey here.
2482	
2483	ANGELO	Upon what cause?
2484	
2485	Second Merchant	To see a reverend Syracusian merchant,
2486	Who put unluckily into this bay
2487	Against the laws and statutes of this town,
2488	Beheaded publicly for his offence.
2489	
2490	ANGELO	See where they come: we will behold his death.
2491	
2492	LUCIANA	Kneel to the duke before he pass the abbey.
2493	
2494	[Enter DUKE SOLINUS, attended; AEGEON bareheaded; with the
2495	Headsman and other Officers]
2496	
2497	DUKE SOLINUS	Yet once again proclaim it publicly,
2498	If any friend will pay the sum for him,
2499	He shall not die; so much we tender him.
2500	
2501	ADRIANA	Justice, most sacred duke, against the abbess!
2502	
2503	DUKE SOLINUS	She is a virtuous and a reverend lady:
2504	It cannot be that she hath done thee wrong.
2505	
2506	ADRIANA	May it please your grace, Antipholus, my husband,
2507	Whom I made lord of me and all I had,
2508	At your important letters,--this ill day
2509	A most outrageous fit of madness took him;
2510	That desperately he hurried through the street,
2511	With him his bondman, all as mad as he--
2512	Doing displeasure to the citizens
2513	By rushing in their houses, bearing thence
2514	Rings, jewels, any thing his rage did like.
2515	Once did I get him bound and sent him home,
2516	Whilst to take order for the wrongs I went,
2517	That here and there his fury had committed.
2518	Anon, I wot not by what strong escape,
2519	He broke from those that had the guard of him;
2520	And with his mad attendant and himself,
2521	Each one with ireful passion, with drawn swords,
2522	Met us again and madly bent on us,
2523	Chased us away; till, raising of more aid,
2524	We came again to bind them. Then they fled
2525	Into this abbey, whither we pursued them:
2526	And here the abbess shuts the gates on us
2527	And will not suffer us to fetch him out,
2528	Nor send him forth that we may bear him hence.
2529	Therefore, most gracious duke, with thy command
2530	Let him be brought forth and borne hence for help.
2531	
2532	DUKE SOLINUS	Long since thy husband served me in my wars,
2533	And I to thee engaged a prince's word,
2534	When thou didst make him master of thy bed,
2535	To do him all the grace and good I could.
2536	Go, some of you, knock at the abbey-gate
2537	And bid the lady abbess come to me.
2538	I will determine this before I stir.
2539	
2540	[Enter a Servant]
2541	
2542	Servant	O mistress, mistress, shift and save yourself!
2543	My master and his man are both broke loose,
2544	Beaten the maids a-row and bound the doctor
2545	Whose beard they have singed off with brands of fire;
2546	And ever, as it blazed, they threw on him
2547	Great pails of puddled mire to quench the hair:
2548	My master preaches patience to him and the while
2549	His man with scissors nicks him like a fool,
2550	And sure, unless you send some present help,
2551	Between them they will kill the conjurer.
2552	
2553	ADRIANA	Peace, fool! thy master and his man are here,
2554	And that is false thou dost report to us.
2555	
2556	Servant	Mistress, upon my life, I tell you true;
2557	I have not breathed almost since I did see it.
2558	He cries for you, and vows, if he can take you,
2559	To scorch your face and to disfigure you.
2560	
2561	[Cry within]
2562	
2563	Hark, hark! I hear him, mistress. fly, be gone!
2564	
2565	DUKE SOLINUS	Come, stand by me; fear nothing. Guard with halberds!
2566	
2567	ADRIANA	Ay me, it is my husband! Witness you,
2568	That he is borne about invisible:
2569	Even now we housed him in the abbey here;
2570	And now he's there, past thought of human reason.
2571	
2572	[Enter ANTIPHOLUS of Ephesus and DROMIO of Ephesus]
2573	
2574	ANTIPHOLUS
2575	OF EPHESUS	Justice, most gracious duke, O, grant me justice!
2576	Even for the service that long since I did thee,
2577	When I bestrid thee in the wars and took
2578	Deep scars to save thy life; even for the blood
2579	That then I lost for thee, now grant me justice.
2580	
2581	AEGEON	Unless the fear of death doth make me dote,
2582	I see my son Antipholus and Dromio.
2583	
2584	ANTIPHOLUS
2585	OF EPHESUS	Justice, sweet prince, against that woman there!
2586	She whom thou gavest to me to be my wife,
2587	That hath abused and dishonour'd me
2588	Even in the strength and height of injury!
2589	Beyond imagination is the wrong
2590	That she this day hath shameless thrown on me.
2591	
2592	DUKE SOLINUS	Discover how, and thou shalt find me just.
2593	
2594	ANTIPHOLUS
2595	OF EPHESUS	This day, great duke, she shut the doors upon me,
2596	While she with harlots feasted in my house.
2597	
2598	DUKE SOLINUS	A grievous fault! Say, woman, didst thou so?
2599	
2600	ADRIANA	No, my good lord: myself, he and my sister
2601	To-day did dine together. So befall my soul
2602	As this is false he burdens me withal!
2603	
2604	LUCIANA	Ne'er may I look on day, nor sleep on night,
2605	But she tells to your highness simple truth!
2606	
2607	ANGELO	O perjured woman! They are both forsworn:
2608	In this the madman justly chargeth them.
2609	
2610	ANTIPHOLUS
2611	OF EPHESUS	My liege, I am advised what I say,
2612	Neither disturbed with the effect of wine,
2613	Nor heady-rash, provoked with raging ire,
2614	Albeit my wrongs might make one wiser mad.
2615	This woman lock'd me out this day from dinner:
2616	That goldsmith there, were he not pack'd with her,
2617	Could witness it, for he was with me then;
2618	Who parted with me to go fetch a chain,
2619	Promising to bring it to the Porpentine,
2620	Where Balthazar and I did dine together.
2621	Our dinner done, and he not coming thither,
2622	I went to seek him: in the street I met him
2623	And in his company that gentleman.
2624	There did this perjured goldsmith swear me down
2625	That I this day of him received the chain,
2626	Which, God he knows, I saw not: for the which
2627	He did arrest me with an officer.
2628	I did obey, and sent my peasant home
2629	For certain ducats: he with none return'd
2630	Then fairly I bespoke the officer
2631	To go in person with me to my house.
2632	By the way we met
2633	My wife, her sister, and a rabble more
2634	Of vile confederates. Along with them
2635	They brought one Pinch, a hungry lean-faced villain,
2636	A mere anatomy, a mountebank,
2637	A threadbare juggler and a fortune-teller,
2638	A needy, hollow-eyed, sharp-looking wretch,
2639	A dead-looking man: this pernicious slave,
2640	Forsooth, took on him as a conjurer,
2641	And, gazing in mine eyes, feeling my pulse,
2642	And with no face, as 'twere, outfacing me,
2643	Cries out, I was possess'd. Then all together
2644	They fell upon me, bound me, bore me thence
2645	And in a dark and dankish vault at home
2646	There left me and my man, both bound together;
2647	Till, gnawing with my teeth my bonds in sunder,
2648	I gain'd my freedom, and immediately
2649	Ran hither to your grace; whom I beseech
2650	To give me ample satisfaction
2651	For these deep shames and great indignities.
2652	
2653	ANGELO	My lord, in truth, thus far I witness with him,
2654	That he dined not at home, but was lock'd out.
2655	
2656	DUKE SOLINUS	But had he such a chain of thee or no?
2657	
2658	ANGELO	He had, my lord: and when he ran in here,
2659	These people saw the chain about his neck.
2660	
2661	Second Merchant	Besides, I will be sworn these ears of mine
2662	Heard you confess you had the chain of him
2663	After you first forswore it on the mart:
2664	And thereupon I drew my sword on you;
2665	And then you fled into this abbey here,
2666	From whence, I think, you are come by miracle.
2667	
2668	ANTIPHOLUS
2669	OF EPHESUS	I never came within these abbey-walls,
2670	Nor ever didst thou draw thy sword on me:
2671	I never saw the chain, so help me Heaven!
2672	And this is false you burden me withal.
2673	
2674	DUKE SOLINUS	Why, what an intricate impeach is this!
2675	I think you all have drunk of Circe's cup.
2676	If here you housed him, here he would have been;
2677	If he were mad, he would not plead so coldly:
2678	You say he dined at home; the goldsmith here
2679	Denies that saying. Sirrah, what say you?
2680	
2681	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Sir, he dined with her there, at the Porpentine.
2682	
2683	Courtezan	He did, and from my finger snatch'd that ring.
2684	
2685	ANTIPHOLUS
2686	OF EPHESUS	'Tis true, my liege; this ring I had of her.
2687	
2688	DUKE SOLINUS	Saw'st thou him enter at the abbey here?
2689	
2690	Courtezan	As sure, my liege, as I do see your grace.
2691	
2692	DUKE SOLINUS	Why, this is strange. Go call the abbess hither.
2693	I think you are all mated or stark mad.
2694	
2695	[Exit one to Abbess]
2696	
2697	AEGEON	Most mighty duke, vouchsafe me speak a word:
2698	Haply I see a friend will save my life
2699	And pay the sum that may deliver me.
2700	
2701	DUKE SOLINUS	Speak freely, Syracusian, what thou wilt.
2702	
2703	AEGEON	Is not your name, sir, call'd Antipholus?
2704	And is not that your bondman, Dromio?
2705	
2706	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Within this hour I was his bondman sir,
2707	But he, I thank him, gnaw'd in two my cords:
2708	Now am I Dromio and his man unbound.
2709	
2710	AEGEON	I am sure you both of you remember me.
2711	
2712	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Ourselves we do remember, sir, by you;
2713	For lately we were bound, as you are now
2714	You are not Pinch's patient, are you, sir?
2715	
2716	AEGEON	Why look you strange on me? you know me well.
2717	
2718	ANTIPHOLUS	I never saw you in my life till now.
2719	
2720	AEGEON	O, grief hath changed me since you saw me last,
2721	And careful hours with time's deformed hand
2722	Have written strange defeatures in my face:
2723	But tell me yet, dost thou not know my voice?
2724	
2725	ANTIPHOLUS
2726	OF EPHESUS	Neither.
2727	
2728	AEGEON	Dromio, nor thou?
2729	
2730	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	                  No, trust me, sir, nor I.
2731	
2732	AEGEON	I am sure thou dost.
2733	
2734	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Ay, sir, but I am sure I do not; and whatsoever a
2735	man denies, you are now bound to believe him.
2736	
2737	AEGEON	Not know my voice! O time's extremity,
2738	Hast thou so crack'd and splitted my poor tongue
2739	In seven short years, that here my only son
2740	Knows not my feeble key of untuned cares?
2741	Though now this grained face of mine be hid
2742	In sap-consuming winter's drizzled snow,
2743	And all the conduits of my blood froze up,
2744	Yet hath my night of life some memory,
2745	My wasting lamps some fading glimmer left,
2746	My dull deaf ears a little use to hear:
2747	All these old witnesses--I cannot err--
2748	Tell me thou art my son Antipholus.
2749	
2750	ANTIPHOLUS
2751	OF EPHESUS	I never saw my father in my life.
2752	
2753	AEGEON	But seven years since, in Syracusa, boy,
2754	Thou know'st we parted: but perhaps, my son,
2755	Thou shamest to acknowledge me in misery.
2756	
2757	ANTIPHOLUS
2758	OF EPHESUS	The duke and all that know me in the city
2759	Can witness with me that it is not so
2760	I ne'er saw Syracusa in my life.
2761	
2762	DUKE SOLINUS	I tell thee, Syracusian, twenty years
2763	Have I been patron to Antipholus,
2764	During which time he ne'er saw Syracusa:
2765	I see thy age and dangers make thee dote.
2766	
2767	[Re-enter AEMILIA, with ANTIPHOLUS of Syracuse and
2768	DROMIO of Syracuse]
2769	
2770	AEMELIA	Most mighty duke, behold a man much wrong'd.
2771	
2772	[All gather to see them]
2773	
2774	ADRIANA	I see two husbands, or mine eyes deceive me.
2775	
2776	DUKE SOLINUS	One of these men is Genius to the other;
2777	And so of these. Which is the natural man,
2778	And which the spirit? who deciphers them?
2779	
2780	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	I, sir, am Dromio; command him away.
2781	
2782	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	I, sir, am Dromio; pray, let me stay.
2783	
2784	ANTIPHOLUS
2785	OF SYRACUSE	AEgeon art thou not? or else his ghost?
2786	
2787	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	O, my old master! who hath bound him here?
2788	
2789	AEMELIA	Whoever bound him, I will loose his bonds
2790	And gain a husband by his liberty.
2791	Speak, old AEgeon, if thou be'st the man
2792	That hadst a wife once call'd AEmilia
2793	That bore thee at a burden two fair sons:
2794	O, if thou be'st the same AEgeon, speak,
2795	And speak unto the same AEmilia!
2796	
2797	AEGEON	If I dream not, thou art AEmilia:
2798	If thou art she, tell me where is that son
2799	That floated with thee on the fatal raft?
2800	
2801	AEMELIA	By men of Epidamnum he and I
2802	And the twin Dromio all were taken up;
2803	But by and by rude fishermen of Corinth
2804	By force took Dromio and my son from them
2805	And me they left with those of Epidamnum.
2806	What then became of them I cannot tell
2807	I to this fortune that you see me in.
2808	
2809	DUKE SOLINUS	Why, here begins his morning story right;
2810	These two Antipholuses, these two so like,
2811	And these two Dromios, one in semblance,--
2812	Besides her urging of her wreck at sea,--
2813	These are the parents to these children,
2814	Which accidentally are met together.
2815	Antipholus, thou camest from Corinth first?
2816	
2817	ANTIPHOLUS
2818	OF SYRACUSE	No, sir, not I; I came from Syracuse.
2819	
2820	DUKE SOLINUS	Stay, stand apart; I know not which is which.
2821	
2822	ANTIPHOLUS
2823	OF EPHESUS	I came from Corinth, my most gracious lord,--
2824	
2825	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	And I with him.
2826	
2827	ANTIPHOLUS
2828	OF EPHESUS	Brought to this town by that most famous warrior,
2829	Duke Menaphon, your most renowned uncle.
2830	
2831	ADRIANA	Which of you two did dine with me to-day?
2832	
2833	ANTIPHOLUS
2834	OF SYRACUSE	I, gentle mistress.
2835	
2836	ADRIANA	And are not you my husband?
2837	
2838	ANTIPHOLUS
2839	OF EPHESUS	No; I say nay to that.
2840	
2841	ANTIPHOLUS
2842	OF SYRACUSE	And so do I; yet did she call me so:
2843	And this fair gentlewoman, her sister here,
2844	Did call me brother.
2845	
2846	[To Luciana]
2847	
2848	What I told you then,
2849	I hope I shall have leisure to make good;
2850	If this be not a dream I see and hear.
2851	
2852	ANGELO	That is the chain, sir, which you had of me.
2853	
2854	ANTIPHOLUS
2855	OF SYRACUSE	I think it be, sir; I deny it not.
2856	
2857	ANTIPHOLUS
2858	OF EPHESUS	And you, sir, for this chain arrested me.
2859	
2860	ANGELO	I think I did, sir; I deny it not.
2861	
2862	ADRIANA	I sent you money, sir, to be your bail,
2863	By Dromio; but I think he brought it not.
2864	
2865	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	No, none by me.
2866	
2867	ANTIPHOLUS
2868	OF SYRACUSE	This purse of ducats I received from you,
2869	And Dromio, my man, did bring them me.
2870	I see we still did meet each other's man,
2871	And I was ta'en for him, and he for me,
2872	And thereupon these errors are arose.
2873	
2874	ANTIPHOLUS
2875	OF EPHESUS	These ducats pawn I for my father here.
2876	
2877	DUKE SOLINUS	It shall not need; thy father hath his life.
2878	
2879	Courtezan	Sir, I must have that diamond from you.
2880	
2881	ANTIPHOLUS
2882	OF EPHESUS	There, take it; and much thanks for my good cheer.
2883	
2884	AEMELIA	Renowned duke, vouchsafe to take the pains
2885	To go with us into the abbey here
2886	And hear at large discoursed all our fortunes:
2887	And all that are assembled in this place,
2888	That by this sympathized one day's error
2889	Have suffer'd wrong, go keep us company,
2890	And we shall make full satisfaction.
2891	Thirty-three years have I but gone in travail
2892	Of you, my sons; and till this present hour
2893	My heavy burden ne'er delivered.
2894	The duke, my husband and my children both,
2895	And you the calendars of their nativity,
2896	Go to a gossips' feast and go with me;
2897	After so long grief, such festivity!
2898	
2899	DUKE SOLINUS	With all my heart, I'll gossip at this feast.
2900	
2901	[Exeunt all but Antipholus of Syracuse, Antipholus
2902	of Ephesus, Dromio of Syracuse and Dromio of Ephesus]
2903	
2904	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Master, shall I fetch your stuff from shipboard?
2905	
2906	ANTIPHOLUS
2907	OF EPHESUS	Dromio, what stuff of mine hast thou embark'd?
2908	
2909	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Your goods that lay at host, sir, in the Centaur.
2910	
2911	ANTIPHOLUS
2912	OF SYRACUSE	He speaks to me. I am your master, Dromio:
2913	Come, go with us; we'll look to that anon:
2914	Embrace thy brother there; rejoice with him.
2915	
2916	[Exeunt Antipholus of Syracuse and Antipholus of Ephesus]
2917	
2918	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	There is a fat friend at your master's house,
2919	That kitchen'd me for you to-day at dinner:
2920	She now shall be my sister, not my wife.
2921	
2922	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Methinks you are my glass, and not my brother:
2923	I see by you I am a sweet-faced youth.
2924	Will you walk in to see their gossiping?
2925	
2926	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	Not I, sir; you are my elder.
2927	
2928	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	That's a question: how shall we try it?
2929	
2930	DROMIO OF SYRACUSE	We'll draw cuts for the senior: till then lead thou first.
2931	
2932	DROMIO OF EPHESUS	Nay, then, thus:
2933	We came into the world like brother and brother;
2934	And now let's go hand in hand, not one before another.
2935	
2936	[Exeunt]

68	ACT I
69	
70	
71	
72	SCENE I	King Lear's palace.
73	
74	
75	[Enter KENT, GLOUCESTER, and EDMUND]
76	
77	KENT	I thought the king had more affected the Duke of
78	Albany than Cornwall.
79	
80	GLOUCESTER	It did always seem so to us: but now, in the
81	division of the kingdom, it appears not which of
82	the dukes he values most; for equalities are so
83	weighed, that curiosity in neither can make choice
84	of either's moiety.
85	
86	KENT	Is not this your son, my lord?
87	
88	GLOUCESTER	His breeding, sir, hath been at my charge: I have
89	so often blushed to acknowledge him, that now I am
90	brazed to it.
91	
92	KENT	I cannot conceive you.
93	
94	GLOUCESTER	Sir, this young fellow's mother could: whereupon
95	she grew round-wombed, and had, indeed, sir, a son
96	for her cradle ere she had a husband for her bed.
97	Do you smell a fault?
98	
99	KENT	I cannot wish the fault undone, the issue of it
100	being so proper.
101	
102	GLOUCESTER	But I have, sir, a son by order of law, some year
103	elder than this, who yet is no dearer in my account:
104	though this knave came something saucily into the
105	world before he was sent for, yet was his mother
106	fair; there was good sport at his making, and the
107	whoreson must be acknowledged. Do you know this
108	noble gentleman, Edmund?
109	
110	EDMUND	No, my lord.
111	
112	GLOUCESTER	My lord of Kent: remember him hereafter as my
113	honourable friend.
114	
115	EDMUND	My services to your lordship.
116	
117	KENT	I must love you, and sue to know you better.
118	
119	EDMUND	Sir, I shall study deserving.
120	
121	GLOUCESTER	He hath been out nine years, and away he shall
122	again. The king is coming.
123	
124	[Sennet. Enter KING LEAR, CORNWALL, ALBANY,
125	GONERIL, REGAN, CORDELIA, and Attendants]
126	
127	KING LEAR	Attend the lords of France and Burgundy, Gloucester.
128	
129	GLOUCESTER	I shall, my liege.
130	
131	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]
132	
133	KING LEAR	Meantime we shall express our darker purpose.
134	Give me the map there. Know that we have divided
135	In three our kingdom: and 'tis our fast intent
136	To shake all cares and business from our age;
137	Conferring them on younger strengths, while we
138	Unburthen'd crawl toward death. Our son of Cornwall,
139	And you, our no less loving son of Albany,
140	We have this hour a constant will to publish
141	Our daughters' several dowers, that future strife
142	May be prevented now. The princes, France and Burgundy,
143	Great rivals in our youngest daughter's love,
144	Long in our court have made their amorous sojourn,
145	And here are to be answer'd. Tell me, my daughters,--
146	Since now we will divest us both of rule,
147	Interest of territory, cares of state,--
148	Which of you shall we say doth love us most?
149	That we our largest bounty may extend
150	Where nature doth with merit challenge. Goneril,
151	Our eldest-born, speak first.
152	
153	GONERIL	Sir, I love you more than words can wield the matter;
154	Dearer than eye-sight, space, and liberty;
155	Beyond what can be valued, rich or rare;
156	No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
157	As much as child e'er loved, or father found;
158	A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable;
159	Beyond all manner of so much I love you.
160	
161	CORDELIA	[Aside]  What shall Cordelia do?
162	Love, and be silent.
163	
164	LEAR	Of all these bounds, even from this line to this,
165	With shadowy forests and with champains rich'd,
166	With plenteous rivers and wide-skirted meads,
167	We make thee lady: to thine and Albany's issue
168	Be this perpetual. What says our second daughter,
169	Our dearest Regan, wife to Cornwall? Speak.
170	
171	REGAN	Sir, I am made
172	Of the self-same metal that my sister is,
173	And prize me at her worth. In my true heart
174	I find she names my very deed of love;
175	Only she comes too short: that I profess
176	Myself an enemy to all other joys,
177	Which the most precious square of sense possesses;
178	And find I am alone felicitate
179	In your dear highness' love.
180	
181	CORDELIA	[Aside]	Then poor Cordelia!
182	And yet not so; since, I am sure, my love's
183	More richer than my tongue.
184	
185	KING LEAR	To thee and thine hereditary ever
186	Remain this ample third of our fair kingdom;
187	No less in space, validity, and pleasure,
188	Than that conferr'd on Goneril. Now, our joy,
189	Although the last, not least; to whose young love
190	The vines of France and milk of Burgundy
191	Strive to be interess'd; what can you say to draw
192	A third more opulent than your sisters? Speak.
193	
194	CORDELIA	Nothing, my lord.
195	
196	KING LEAR	Nothing!
197	
198	CORDELIA	Nothing.
199	
200	KING LEAR	Nothing will come of nothing: speak again.
201	
202	CORDELIA	Unhappy that I am, I cannot heave
203	My heart into my mouth: I love your majesty
204	According to my bond; nor more nor less.
205	
206	KING LEAR	How, how, Cordelia! mend your speech a little,
207	Lest it may mar your fortunes.
208	
209	CORDELIA	Good my lord,
210	You have begot me, bred me, loved me: I
211	Return those duties back as are right fit,
212	Obey you, love you, and most honour you.
213	Why have my sisters husbands, if they say
214	They love you all? Haply, when I shall wed,
215	That lord whose hand must take my plight shall carry
216	Half my love with him, half my care and duty:
217	Sure, I shall never marry like my sisters,
218	To love my father all.
219	
220	KING LEAR	But goes thy heart with this?
221	
222	CORDELIA	Ay, good my lord.
223	
224	KING LEAR	So young, and so untender?
225	
226	CORDELIA	So young, my lord, and true.
227	
228	KING LEAR	Let it be so; thy truth, then, be thy dower:
229	For, by the sacred radiance of the sun,
230	The mysteries of Hecate, and the night;
231	By all the operation of the orbs
232	From whom we do exist, and cease to be;
233	Here I disclaim all my paternal care,
234	Propinquity and property of blood,
235	And as a stranger to my heart and me
236	Hold thee, from this, for ever. The barbarous Scythian,
237	Or he that makes his generation messes
238	To gorge his appetite, shall to my bosom
239	Be as well neighbour'd, pitied, and relieved,
240	As thou my sometime daughter.
241	
242	KENT	Good my liege,--
243	
244	KING LEAR	Peace, Kent!
245	Come not between the dragon and his wrath.
246	I loved her most, and thought to set my rest
247	On her kind nursery. Hence, and avoid my sight!
248	So be my grave my peace, as here I give
249	Her father's heart from her! Call France; who stirs?
250	Call Burgundy. Cornwall and Albany,
251	With my two daughters' dowers digest this third:
252	Let pride, which she calls plainness, marry her.
253	I do invest you jointly with my power,
254	Pre-eminence, and all the large effects
255	That troop with majesty. Ourself, by monthly course,
256	With reservation of an hundred knights,
257	By you to be sustain'd, shall our abode
258	Make with you by due turns. Only we still retain
259	The name, and all the additions to a king;
260	The sway, revenue, execution of the rest,
261	Beloved sons, be yours: which to confirm,
262	This coronet part betwixt you.
263	
264	[Giving the crown]
265	
266	KENT	Royal Lear,
267	Whom I have ever honour'd as my king,
268	Loved as my father, as my master follow'd,
269	As my great patron thought on in my prayers,--
270	
271	KING LEAR	The bow is bent and drawn, make from the shaft.
272	
273	KENT	Let it fall rather, though the fork invade
274	The region of my heart: be Kent unmannerly,
275	When Lear is mad. What wilt thou do, old man?
276	Think'st thou that duty shall have dread to speak,
277	When power to flattery bows? To plainness honour's bound,
278	When majesty stoops to folly. Reverse thy doom;
279	And, in thy best consideration, cheque
280	This hideous rashness: answer my life my judgment,
281	Thy youngest daughter does not love thee least;
282	Nor are those empty-hearted whose low sound
283	Reverbs no hollowness.
284	
285	KING LEAR	Kent, on thy life, no more.
286	
287	KENT	My life I never held but as a pawn
288	To wage against thy enemies; nor fear to lose it,
289	Thy safety being the motive.
290	
291	KING LEAR	Out of my sight!
292	
293	KENT	See better, Lear; and let me still remain
294	The true blank of thine eye.
295	
296	KING LEAR	Now, by Apollo,--
297	
298	KENT	                  Now, by Apollo, king,
299	Thou swear'st thy gods in vain.
300	
301	KING LEAR	O, vassal! miscreant!
302	
303	[Laying his hand on his sword]
304	
305	
306	ALBANY	|
307	|  Dear sir, forbear.
308	CORNWALL	|
309	
310	
311	KENT	Do:
312	Kill thy physician, and the fee bestow
313	Upon thy foul disease. Revoke thy doom;
314	Or, whilst I can vent clamour from my throat,
315	I'll tell thee thou dost evil.
316	
317	KING LEAR	Hear me, recreant!
318	On thine allegiance, hear me!
319	Since thou hast sought to make us break our vow,
320	Which we durst never yet, and with strain'd pride
321	To come between our sentence and our power,
322	Which nor our nature nor our place can bear,
323	Our potency made good, take thy reward.
324	Five days we do allot thee, for provision
325	To shield thee from diseases of the world;
326	And on the sixth to turn thy hated back
327	Upon our kingdom: if, on the tenth day following,
328	Thy banish'd trunk be found in our dominions,
329	The moment is thy death. Away! by Jupiter,
330	This shall not be revoked.
331	
332	KENT	Fare thee well, king: sith thus thou wilt appear,
333	Freedom lives hence, and banishment is here.
334	
335	[To CORDELIA]
336	
337	The gods to their dear shelter take thee, maid,
338	That justly think'st, and hast most rightly said!
339	
340	[To REGAN and GONERIL]
341	
342	And your large speeches may your deeds approve,
343	That good effects may spring from words of love.
344	Thus Kent, O princes, bids you all adieu;
345	He'll shape his old course in a country new.
346	
347	[Exit]
348	
349	[Flourish. Re-enter GLOUCESTER, with KING OF FRANCE,
350	BURGUNDY, and Attendants]
351	
352	GLOUCESTER	Here's France and Burgundy, my noble lord.
353	
354	KING LEAR	My lord of Burgundy.
355	We first address towards you, who with this king
356	Hath rivall'd for our daughter: what, in the least,
357	Will you require in present dower with her,
358	Or cease your quest of love?
359	
360	BURGUNDY	Most royal majesty,
361	I crave no more than what your highness offer'd,
362	Nor will you tender less.
363	
364	KING LEAR	Right noble Burgundy,
365	When she was dear to us, we did hold her so;
366	But now her price is fall'n. Sir, there she stands:
367	If aught within that little seeming substance,
368	Or all of it, with our displeasure pieced,
369	And nothing more, may fitly like your grace,
370	She's there, and she is yours.
371	
372	BURGUNDY	I know no answer.
373	
374	KING LEAR	Will you, with those infirmities she owes,
375	Unfriended, new-adopted to our hate,
376	Dower'd with our curse, and stranger'd with our oath,
377	Take her, or leave her?
378	
379	BURGUNDY	Pardon me, royal sir;
380	Election makes not up on such conditions.
381	
382	KING LEAR	Then leave her, sir; for, by the power that made me,
383	I tell you all her wealth.
384	
385	[To KING OF FRANCE]
386	
387	For you, great king,
388	I would not from your love make such a stray,
389	To match you where I hate; therefore beseech you
390	To avert your liking a more worthier way
391	Than on a wretch whom nature is ashamed
392	Almost to acknowledge hers.
393	
394	KING OF FRANCE	This is most strange,
395	That she, that even but now was your best object,
396	The argument of your praise, balm of your age,
397	Most best, most dearest, should in this trice of time
398	Commit a thing so monstrous, to dismantle
399	So many folds of favour. Sure, her offence
400	Must be of such unnatural degree,
401	That monsters it, or your fore-vouch'd affection
402	Fall'n into taint: which to believe of her,
403	Must be a faith that reason without miracle
404	Could never plant in me.
405	
406	CORDELIA	I yet beseech your majesty,--
407	If for I want that glib and oily art,
408	To speak and purpose not; since what I well intend,
409	I'll do't before I speak,--that you make known
410	It is no vicious blot, murder, or foulness,
411	No unchaste action, or dishonour'd step,
412	That hath deprived me of your grace and favour;
413	But even for want of that for which I am richer,
414	A still-soliciting eye, and such a tongue
415	As I am glad I have not, though not to have it
416	Hath lost me in your liking.
417	
418	KING LEAR	Better thou
419	Hadst not been born than not to have pleased me better.
420	
421	KING OF FRANCE	Is it but this,--a tardiness in nature
422	Which often leaves the history unspoke
423	That it intends to do? My lord of Burgundy,
424	What say you to the lady? Love's not love
425	When it is mingled with regards that stand
426	Aloof from the entire point. Will you have her?
427	She is herself a dowry.
428	
429	BURGUNDY	Royal Lear,
430	Give but that portion which yourself proposed,
431	And here I take Cordelia by the hand,
432	Duchess of Burgundy.
433	
434	KING LEAR	Nothing: I have sworn; I am firm.
435	
436	BURGUNDY	I am sorry, then, you have so lost a father
437	That you must lose a husband.
438	
439	CORDELIA	Peace be with Burgundy!
440	Since that respects of fortune are his love,
441	I shall not be his wife.
442	
443	KING OF FRANCE	Fairest Cordelia, that art most rich, being poor;
444	Most choice, forsaken; and most loved, despised!
445	Thee and thy virtues here I seize upon:
446	Be it lawful I take up what's cast away.
447	Gods, gods! 'tis strange that from their cold'st neglect
448	My love should kindle to inflamed respect.
449	Thy dowerless daughter, king, thrown to my chance,
450	Is queen of us, of ours, and our fair France:
451	Not all the dukes of waterish Burgundy
452	Can buy this unprized precious maid of me.
453	Bid them farewell, Cordelia, though unkind:
454	Thou losest here, a better where to find.
455	
456	KING LEAR	Thou hast her, France: let her be thine; for we
457	Have no such daughter, nor shall ever see
458	That face of hers again. Therefore be gone
459	Without our grace, our love, our benison.
460	Come, noble Burgundy.
461	
462	[Flourish. Exeunt all but KING OF FRANCE, GONERIL,
463	REGAN, and CORDELIA]
464	
465	KING OF FRANCE	Bid farewell to your sisters.
466	
467	CORDELIA	The jewels of our father, with wash'd eyes
468	Cordelia leaves you: I know you what you are;
469	And like a sister am most loath to call
470	Your faults as they are named. Use well our father:
471	To your professed bosoms I commit him
472	But yet, alas, stood I within his grace,
473	I would prefer him to a better place.
474	So, farewell to you both.
475	
476	REGAN	Prescribe not us our duties.
477	
478	GONERIL	Let your study
479	Be to content your lord, who hath received you
480	At fortune's alms. You have obedience scanted,
481	And well are worth the want that you have wanted.
482	
483	CORDELIA	Time shall unfold what plaited cunning hides:
484	Who cover faults, at last shame them derides.
485	Well may you prosper!
486	
487	KING OF FRANCE	Come, my fair Cordelia.
488	
489	[Exeunt KING OF FRANCE and CORDELIA]
490	
491	GONERIL	Sister, it is not a little I have to say of what
492	most nearly appertains to us both. I think our
493	father will hence to-night.
494	
495	REGAN	That's most certain, and with you; next month with us.
496	
497	GONERIL	You see how full of changes his age is; the
498	observation we have made of it hath not been
499	little: he always loved our sister most; and
500	with what poor judgment he hath now cast her off
501	appears too grossly.
502	
503	REGAN	'Tis the infirmity of his age: yet he hath ever
504	but slenderly known himself.
505	
506	GONERIL	The best and soundest of his time hath been but
507	rash; then must we look to receive from his age,
508	not alone the imperfections of long-engraffed
509	condition, but therewithal the unruly waywardness
510	that infirm and choleric years bring with them.
511	
512	REGAN	Such unconstant starts are we like to have from
513	him as this of Kent's banishment.
514	
515	GONERIL	There is further compliment of leavetaking
516	between France and him. Pray you, let's hit
517	together: if our father carry authority with
518	such dispositions as he bears, this last
519	surrender of his will but offend us.
520	
521	REGAN	We shall further think on't.
522	
523	GONERIL	We must do something, and i' the heat.
524

536	
537	SCENE II	The Earl of Gloucester's castle.
538	
539	
540	[Enter EDMUND, with a letter]
541	
542	EDMUND	Thou, nature, art my goddess; to thy law
543	My services are bound. Wherefore should I
544	Stand in the plague of custom, and permit
545	The curiosity of nations to deprive me,
546	For that I am some twelve or fourteen moon-shines
547	Lag of a brother? Why bastard? wherefore base?
548	When my dimensions are as well compact,
549	My mind as generous, and my shape as true,
550	As honest madam's issue? Why brand they us
551	With base? with baseness? bastardy? base, base?
552	Who, in the lusty stealth of nature, take
553	More composition and fierce quality
554	Than doth, within a dull, stale, tired bed,
555	Go to the creating a whole tribe of fops,
556	Got 'tween asleep and wake? Well, then,
557	Legitimate Edgar, I must have your land:
558	Our father's love is to the bastard Edmund
559	As to the legitimate: fine word,--legitimate!
560	Well, my legitimate, if this letter speed,
561	And my invention thrive, Edmund the base
562	Shall top the legitimate. I grow; I prosper:
563	Now, gods, stand up for bastards!
564	
565	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
566	
567	GLOUCESTER	Kent banish'd thus! and France in choler parted!
568	And the king gone to-night! subscribed his power!
569	Confined to exhibition! All this done
570	Upon the gad! Edmund, how now! what news?
571	
572	EDMUND	So please your lordship, none.
573	
574	[Putting up the letter]
575	
576	GLOUCESTER	Why so earnestly seek you to put up that letter?
577	
578	EDMUND	I know no news, my lord.
579	
580	GLOUCESTER	What paper were you reading?
581	
582	EDMUND	Nothing, my lord.
583	
584	GLOUCESTER	No? What needed, then, that terrible dispatch of
585	it into your pocket? the quality of nothing hath
586	not such need to hide itself. Let's see: come,
587	if it be nothing, I shall not need spectacles.
588	
589	EDMUND	I beseech you, sir, pardon me: it is a letter
590	from my brother, that I have not all o'er-read;
591	and for so much as I have perused, I find it not
592	fit for your o'er-looking.
593	
594	GLOUCESTER	Give me the letter, sir.
595	
596	EDMUND	I shall offend, either to detain or give it. The
597	contents, as in part I understand them, are to blame.
598	
599	GLOUCESTER	Let's see, let's see.
600	
601	EDMUND	I hope, for my brother's justification, he wrote
602	this but as an essay or taste of my virtue.
603	
604	GLOUCESTER	[Reads]  'This policy and reverence of age makes
605	the world bitter to the best of our times; keeps
606	our fortunes from us till our oldness cannot relish
607	them. I begin to find an idle and fond bondage
608	in the oppression of aged tyranny; who sways, not
609	as it hath power, but as it is suffered. Come to
610	me, that of this I may speak more. If our father
611	would sleep till I waked him, you should half his
612	revenue for ever, and live the beloved of your
613	brother,	EDGAR.'
614	
615	Hum--conspiracy!--'Sleep till I waked him,--you
616	should enjoy half his revenue,'--My son Edgar!
617	Had he a hand to write this? a heart and brain
618	to breed it in?--When came this to you? who
619	brought it?
620	
621	EDMUND	It was not brought me, my lord; there's the
622	cunning of it; I found it thrown in at the
623	casement of my closet.
624	
625	GLOUCESTER	You know the character to be your brother's?
626	
627	EDMUND	If the matter were good, my lord, I durst swear
628	it were his; but, in respect of that, I would
629	fain think it were not.
630	
631	GLOUCESTER	It is his.
632	
633	EDMUND	It is his hand, my lord; but I hope his heart is
634	not in the contents.
635	
636	GLOUCESTER	Hath he never heretofore sounded you in this business?
637	
638	EDMUND	Never, my lord: but I have heard him oft
639	maintain it to be fit, that, sons at perfect age,
640	and fathers declining, the father should be as
641	ward to the son, and the son manage his revenue.
642	
643	GLOUCESTER	O villain, villain! His very opinion in the
644	letter! Abhorred villain! Unnatural, detested,
645	brutish villain! worse than brutish! Go, sirrah,
646	seek him; I'll apprehend him: abominable villain!
647	Where is he?
648	
649	EDMUND	I do not well know, my lord. If it shall please
650	you to suspend your indignation against my
651	brother till you can derive from him better
652	testimony of his intent, you shall run a certain
653	course; where, if you violently proceed against
654	him, mistaking his purpose, it would make a great
655	gap in your own honour, and shake in pieces the
656	heart of his obedience. I dare pawn down my life
657	for him, that he hath wrote this to feel my
658	affection to your honour, and to no further
659	pretence of danger.
660	
661	GLOUCESTER	Think you so?
662	
663	EDMUND	If your honour judge it meet, I will place you
664	where you shall hear us confer of this, and by an
665	auricular assurance have your satisfaction; and
666	that without any further delay than this very evening.
667	
668	GLOUCESTER	He cannot be such a monster--
669	
670	EDMUND	Nor is not, sure.
671	
672	GLOUCESTER	To his father, that so tenderly and entirely
673	loves him. Heaven and earth! Edmund, seek him
674	out: wind me into him, I pray you: frame the
675	business after your own wisdom. I would unstate
676	myself, to be in a due resolution.
677	
678	EDMUND	I will seek him, sir, presently: convey the
679	business as I shall find means and acquaint you withal.
680	
681	GLOUCESTER	These late eclipses in the sun and moon portend
682	no good to us: though the wisdom of nature can
683	reason it thus and thus, yet nature finds itself
684	scourged by the sequent effects: love cools,
685	friendship falls off, brothers divide: in
686	cities, mutinies; in countries, discord; in
687	palaces, treason; and the bond cracked 'twixt son
688	and father. This villain of mine comes under the
689	prediction; there's son against father: the king
690	falls from bias of nature; there's father against
691	child. We have seen the best of our time:
692	machinations, hollowness, treachery, and all
693	ruinous disorders, follow us disquietly to our
694	graves. Find out this villain, Edmund; it shall
695	lose thee nothing; do it carefully. And the
696	noble and true-hearted Kent banished! his
697	offence, honesty! 'Tis strange.
698	
699	[Exit]
700	
701	EDMUND	This is the excellent foppery of the world, that,
702	when we are sick in fortune,--often the surfeit
703	of our own behavior,--we make guilty of our
704	disasters the sun, the moon, and the stars: as
705	if we were villains by necessity; fools by
706	heavenly compulsion; knaves, thieves, and
707	treachers, by spherical predominance; drunkards,
708	liars, and adulterers, by an enforced obedience of
709	planetary influence; and all that we are evil in,
710	by a divine thrusting on: an admirable evasion
711	of whoremaster man, to lay his goatish
712	disposition to the charge of a star! My
713	father compounded with my mother under the
714	dragon's tail; and my nativity was under Ursa
715	major; so that it follows, I am rough and
716	lecherous. Tut, I should have been that I am,
717	had the maidenliest star in the firmament
718	twinkled on my bastardizing. Edgar--
719	
720	[Enter EDGAR]
721	
722	And pat he comes like the catastrophe of the old
723	comedy: my cue is villanous melancholy, with a
724	sigh like Tom o' Bedlam. O, these eclipses do
725	portend these divisions! fa, sol, la, mi.
726	
727	EDGAR	How now, brother Edmund! what serious
728	contemplation are you in?
729	
730	EDMUND	I am thinking, brother, of a prediction I read
731	this other day, what should follow these eclipses.
732	
733	EDGAR	Do you busy yourself about that?
734	
735	EDMUND	I promise you, the effects he writes of succeed
736	unhappily; as of unnaturalness between the child
737	and the parent; death, dearth, dissolutions of
738	ancient amities; divisions in state, menaces and
739	maledictions against king and nobles; needless
740	diffidences, banishment of friends, dissipation
741	of cohorts, nuptial breaches, and I know not what.
742	
743	EDGAR	How long have you been a sectary astronomical?
744	
745	EDMUND	Come, come; when saw you my father last?
746	
747	EDGAR	Why, the night gone by.
748	
749	EDMUND	Spake you with him?
750	
751	EDGAR	Ay, two hours together.
752	
753	EDMUND	Parted you in good terms? Found you no
754	displeasure in him by word or countenance?
755	
756	EDGAR	None at all.
757	
758	EDMUND	Bethink yourself wherein you may have offended
759	him: and at my entreaty forbear his presence
760	till some little time hath qualified the heat of
761	his displeasure; which at this instant so rageth
762	in him, that with the mischief of your person it
763	would scarcely allay.
764	
765	EDGAR	Some villain hath done me wrong.
766	
767	EDMUND	That's my fear. I pray you, have a continent
768	forbearance till the spied of his rage goes
769	slower; and, as I say, retire with me to my
770	lodging, from whence I will fitly bring you to
771	hear my lord speak: pray ye, go; there's my key:
772	if you do stir abroad, go armed.
773	
774	EDGAR	Armed, brother!
775	
776	EDMUND	Brother, I advise you to the best; go armed: I
777	am no honest man if there be any good meaning
778	towards you: I have told you what I have seen
779	and heard; but faintly, nothing like the image
780	and horror of it: pray you, away.
781	
782	EDGAR	Shall I hear from you anon?
783	
784	EDMUND	I do serve you in this business.
785	
786	[Exit EDGAR]
787	
788	A credulous father! and a brother noble,
789	Whose nature is so far from doing harms,
790	That he suspects none: on whose foolish honesty
791	My practises ride easy! I see the business.
792	Let me, if not by birth, have lands by wit:
793	All with me's meet that I can fashion fit.

803	ACT I

805	
806	
807	SCENE III	The Duke of Albany's palace.
808	
809	
810	[Enter GONERIL, and OSWALD, her steward]
811	
812	GONERIL	Did my father strike my gentleman for chiding of his fool?
813	
814	OSWALD	Yes, madam.
815	
816	GONERIL	By day and night he wrongs me; every hour
817	He flashes into one gross crime or other,
818	That sets us all at odds: I'll not endure it:
819	His knights grow riotous, and himself upbraids us
820	On every trifle. When he returns from hunting,
821	I will not speak with him; say I am sick:
822	If you come slack of former services,
823	You shall do well; the fault of it I'll answer.
824	
825	OSWALD	He's coming, madam; I hear him.
826	
827	[Horns within]
828	
829	GONERIL	Put on what weary negligence you please,
830	You and your fellows; I'll have it come to question:
831	If he dislike it, let him to our sister,
832	Whose mind and mine, I know, in that are one,
833	Not to be over-ruled. Idle old man,
834	That still would manage those authorities
835	That he hath given away! Now, by my life,
836	Old fools are babes again; and must be used
837	With cheques as flatteries,--when they are seen abused.
838	Remember what I tell you.
839	
840	OSWALD	Well, madam.
841	
842	GONERIL	And let his knights have colder looks among you;
843	What grows of it, no matter; advise your fellows so:
844	I would breed from hence occasions, and I shall,
845	That I may speak: I'll write straight to my sister,
846	To hold my very course. Prepare for dinner.

855	
856	ACT I
857	
858	
859	
860	SCENE IV	A hall in the same.
861	
862	
863	[Enter KENT, disguised]
864	
865	KENT	If but as well I other accents borrow,
866	That can my speech defuse, my good intent
867	May carry through itself to that full issue
868	For which I razed my likeness. Now, banish'd Kent,
869	If thou canst serve where thou dost stand condemn'd,
870	So may it come, thy master, whom thou lovest,
871	Shall find thee full of labours.
872	
873	[Horns within. Enter KING LEAR, Knights, and
874	Attendants]
875	
876	KING LEAR	Let me not stay a jot for dinner; go get it ready.
877	
878	[Exit an Attendant]
879	
880	How now! what art thou?
881	
882	KENT	A man, sir.
883	
884	KING LEAR	What dost thou profess? what wouldst thou with us?
885	
886	KENT	I do profess to be no less than I seem; to serve
887	him truly that will put me in trust: to love him
888	that is honest; to converse with him that is wise,
889	and says little; to fear judgment; to fight when I
890	cannot choose; and to eat no fish.
891	
892	KING LEAR	What art thou?
893	
894	KENT	A very honest-hearted fellow, and as poor as the king.
895	
896	KING LEAR	If thou be as poor for a subject as he is for a
897	king, thou art poor enough. What wouldst thou?
898	
899	KENT	Service.
900	
901	KING LEAR	Who wouldst thou serve?
902	
903	KENT	You.
904	
905	KING LEAR	Dost thou know me, fellow?
906	
907	KENT	No, sir; but you have that in your countenance
908	which I would fain call master.
909	
910	KING LEAR	What's that?
911	
912	KENT	Authority.
913	
914	KING LEAR	What services canst thou do?
915	
916	KENT	I can keep honest counsel, ride, run, mar a curious
917	tale in telling it, and deliver a plain message
918	bluntly: that which ordinary men are fit for, I am
919	qualified in; and the best of me is diligence.
920	
921	KING LEAR	How old art thou?
922	
923	KENT	Not so young, sir, to love a woman for singing, nor
924	so old to dote on her for any thing: I have years
925	on my back forty eight.
926	
927	KING LEAR	Follow me; thou shalt serve me: if I like thee no
928	worse after dinner, I will not part from thee yet.
929	Dinner, ho, dinner! Where's my knave? my fool?
930	Go you, and call my fool hither.
931	
932	[Exit an Attendant]
933	
934	[Enter OSWALD]
935	
936	You, you, sirrah, where's my daughter?
937	
938	OSWALD	So please you,--
939	
940	[Exit]
941	
942	KING LEAR	What says the fellow there? Call the clotpoll back.
943	
944	[Exit a Knight]
945	
946	Where's my fool, ho? I think the world's asleep.
947	
948	[Re-enter Knight]
949	
950	How now! where's that mongrel?
951	
952	Knight	He says, my lord, your daughter is not well.
953	
954	KING LEAR	Why came not the slave back to me when I called him.
955	
956	Knight	Sir, he answered me in the roundest manner, he would
957	not.
958	
959	KING LEAR	He would not!
960	
961	Knight	My lord, I know not what the matter is; but, to my
962	judgment, your highness is not entertained with that
963	ceremonious affection as you were wont; there's a
964	great abatement of kindness appears as well in the
965	general dependants as in the duke himself also and
966	your daughter.
967	
968	KING LEAR	Ha! sayest thou so?
969	
970	Knight	I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, if I be mistaken;
971	for my duty cannot be silent when I think your
972	highness wronged.
973	
974	KING LEAR	Thou but rememberest me of mine own conception: I
975	have perceived a most faint neglect of late; which I
976	have rather blamed as mine own jealous curiosity
977	than as a very pretence and purpose of unkindness:
978	I will look further into't. But where's my fool? I
979	have not seen him this two days.
980	
981	Knight	Since my young lady's going into France, sir, the
982	fool hath much pined away.
983	
984	KING LEAR	No more of that; I have noted it well. Go you, and
985	tell my daughter I would speak with her.
986	
987	[Exit an Attendant]
988	
989	Go you, call hither my fool.
990	
991	[Exit an Attendant]
992	
993	[Re-enter OSWALD]
994	
995	O, you sir, you, come you hither, sir: who am I,
996	sir?
997	
998	OSWALD	My lady's father.
999	
1000	KING LEAR	'My lady's father'! my lord's knave: your
1001	whoreson dog! you slave! you cur!
1002	
1003	OSWALD	I am none of these, my lord; I beseech your pardon.
1004	
1005	KING LEAR	Do you bandy looks with me, you rascal?
1006	
1007	[Striking him]
1008	
1009	OSWALD	I'll not be struck, my lord.
1010	
1011	KENT	Nor tripped neither, you base football player.
1012	
1013	[Tripping up his heels]
1014	
1015	KING LEAR	I thank thee, fellow; thou servest me, and I'll
1016	love thee.
1017	
1018	KENT	Come, sir, arise, away! I'll teach you differences:
1019	away, away! if you will measure your lubber's
1020	length again, tarry: but away! go to; have you
1021	wisdom? so.
1022	
1023	[Pushes OSWALD out]
1024	
1025	KING LEAR	Now, my friendly knave, I thank thee: there's
1026	earnest of thy service.
1027	
1028	[Giving KENT money]
1029	
1030	[Enter Fool]
1031	
1032	Fool	Let me hire him too: here's my coxcomb.
1033	
1034	[Offering KENT his cap]
1035	
1036	KING LEAR	How now, my pretty knave! how dost thou?
1037	
1038	Fool	Sirrah, you were best take my coxcomb.
1039	
1040	KENT	Why, fool?
1041	
1042	Fool	Why, for taking one's part that's out of favour:
1043	nay, an thou canst not smile as the wind sits,
1044	thou'lt catch cold shortly: there, take my coxcomb:
1045	why, this fellow has banished two on's daughters,
1046	and did the third a blessing against his will; if
1047	thou follow him, thou must needs wear my coxcomb.
1048	How now, nuncle! Would I had two coxcombs and two daughters!
1049	
1050	KING LEAR	Why, my boy?
1051	
1052	Fool	If I gave them all my living, I'ld keep my coxcombs
1053	myself. There's mine; beg another of thy daughters.
1054	
1055	KING LEAR	Take heed, sirrah; the whip.
1056	
1057	Fool	Truth's a dog must to kennel; he must be whipped
1058	out, when Lady the brach may stand by the fire and stink.
1059	
1060	KING LEAR	A pestilent gall to me!
1061	
1062	Fool	Sirrah, I'll teach thee a speech.
1063	
1064	KING LEAR	Do.
1065	
1066	Fool	Mark it, nuncle:
1067	Have more than thou showest,
1068	Speak less than thou knowest,
1069	Lend less than thou owest,
1070	Ride more than thou goest,
1071	Learn more than thou trowest,
1072	Set less than thou throwest;
1073	Leave thy drink and thy whore,
1074	And keep in-a-door,
1075	And thou shalt have more
1076	Than two tens to a score.
1077	
1078	KENT	This is nothing, fool.
1079	
1080	Fool	Then 'tis like the breath of an unfee'd lawyer; you
1081	gave me nothing for't. Can you make no use of
1082	nothing, nuncle?
1083	
1084	KING LEAR	Why, no, boy; nothing can be made out of nothing.
1085	
1086	Fool	[To KENT]  Prithee, tell him, so much the rent of
1087	his land comes to: he will not believe a fool.
1088	
1089	KING LEAR	A bitter fool!
1090	
1091	Fool	Dost thou know the difference, my boy, between a
1092	bitter fool and a sweet fool?
1093	
1094	KING LEAR	No, lad; teach me.
1095	
1096	Fool	That lord that counsell'd thee
1097	To give away thy land,
1098	Come place him here by me,
1099	Do thou for him stand:
1100	The sweet and bitter fool
1101	Will presently appear;
1102	The one in motley here,
1103	The other found out there.
1104	
1105	KING LEAR	Dost thou call me fool, boy?
1106	
1107	Fool	All thy other titles thou hast given away; that
1108	thou wast born with.
1109	
1110	KENT	This is not altogether fool, my lord.
1111	
1112	Fool	No, faith, lords and great men will not let me; if
1113	I had a monopoly out, they would have part on't:
1114	and ladies too, they will not let me have all fool
1115	to myself; they'll be snatching. Give me an egg,
1116	nuncle, and I'll give thee two crowns.
1117	
1118	KING LEAR	What two crowns shall they be?
1119	
1120	Fool	Why, after I have cut the egg i' the middle, and eat
1121	up the meat, the two crowns of the egg. When thou
1122	clovest thy crown i' the middle, and gavest away
1123	both parts, thou borest thy ass on thy back o'er
1124	the dirt: thou hadst little wit in thy bald crown,
1125	when thou gavest thy golden one away. If I speak
1126	like myself in this, let him be whipped that first
1127	finds it so.
1128	
1129	[Singing]
1130	
1131	Fools had ne'er less wit in a year;
1132	For wise men are grown foppish,
1133	They know not how their wits to wear,
1134	Their manners are so apish.
1135	
1136	KING LEAR	When were you wont to be so full of songs, sirrah?
1137	
1138	Fool	I have used it, nuncle, ever since thou madest thy
1139	daughters thy mothers: for when thou gavest them
1140	the rod, and put'st down thine own breeches,
1141	
1142	[Singing]
1143	
1144	Then they for sudden joy did weep,
1145	And I for sorrow sung,
1146	That such a king should play bo-peep,
1147	And go the fools among.
1148	
1149	Prithee, nuncle, keep a schoolmaster that can teach
1150	thy fool to lie: I would fain learn to lie.
1151	
1152	KING LEAR	An you lie, sirrah, we'll have you whipped.
1153	
1154	Fool	I marvel what kin thou and thy daughters are:
1155	they'll have me whipped for speaking true, thou'lt
1156	have me whipped for lying; and sometimes I am
1157	whipped for holding my peace. I had rather be any
1158	kind o' thing than a fool: and yet I would not be
1159	thee, nuncle; thou hast pared thy wit o' both sides,
1160	and left nothing i' the middle: here comes one o'
1161	the parings.
1162	
1163	[Enter GONERIL]
1164	
1165	KING LEAR	How now, daughter! what makes that frontlet on?
1166	Methinks you are too much of late i' the frown.
1167	
1168	Fool	Thou wast a pretty fellow when thou hadst no need to
1169	care for her frowning; now thou art an O without a
1170	figure: I am better than thou art now; I am a fool,
1171	thou art nothing.
1172	
1173	[To GONERIL]
1174	
1175	Yes, forsooth, I will hold my tongue; so your face
1176	bids me, though you say nothing. Mum, mum,
1177	He that keeps nor crust nor crum,
1178	Weary of all, shall want some.
1179	
1180	[Pointing to KING LEAR]
1181	
1182	That's a shealed peascod.
1183	
1184	GONERIL	Not only, sir, this your all-licensed fool,
1185	But other of your insolent retinue
1186	Do hourly carp and quarrel; breaking forth
1187	In rank and not-to-be endured riots. Sir,
1188	I had thought, by making this well known unto you,
1189	To have found a safe redress; but now grow fearful,
1190	By what yourself too late have spoke and done.
1191	That you protect this course, and put it on
1192	By your allowance; which if you should, the fault
1193	Would not 'scape censure, nor the redresses sleep,
1194	Which, in the tender of a wholesome weal,
1195	Might in their working do you that offence,
1196	Which else were shame, that then necessity
1197	Will call discreet proceeding.
1198	
1199	Fool	For, you trow, nuncle,
1200	The hedge-sparrow fed the cuckoo so long,
1201	That it's had it head bit off by it young.
1202	So, out went the candle, and we were left darkling.
1203	
1204	KING LEAR	Are you our daughter?
1205	
1206	GONERIL	Come, sir,
1207	I would you would make use of that good wisdom,
1208	Whereof I know you are fraught; and put away
1209	These dispositions, that of late transform you
1210	From what you rightly are.
1211	
1212	Fool	May not an ass know when the cart
1213	draws the horse? Whoop, Jug! I love thee.
1214	
1215	KING LEAR	Doth any here know me? This is not Lear:
1216	Doth Lear walk thus? speak thus? Where are his eyes?
1217	Either his notion weakens, his discernings
1218	Are lethargied--Ha! waking? 'tis not so.
1219	Who is it that can tell me who I am?
1220	
1221	Fool	Lear's shadow.
1222	
1223	KING LEAR	I would learn that; for, by the
1224	marks of sovereignty, knowledge, and reason,
1225	I should be false persuaded I had daughters.
1226	
1227	Fool	Which they will make an obedient father.
1228	
1229	KING LEAR	Your name, fair gentlewoman?
1230	
1231	GONERIL	This admiration, sir, is much o' the savour
1232	Of other your new pranks. I do beseech you
1233	To understand my purposes aright:
1234	As you are old and reverend, you should be wise.
1235	Here do you keep a hundred knights and squires;
1236	Men so disorder'd, so debosh'd and bold,
1237	That this our court, infected with their manners,
1238	Shows like a riotous inn: epicurism and lust
1239	Make it more like a tavern or a brothel
1240	Than a graced palace. The shame itself doth speak
1241	For instant remedy: be then desired
1242	By her, that else will take the thing she begs,
1243	A little to disquantity your train;
1244	And the remainder, that shall still depend,
1245	To be such men as may besort your age,
1246	And know themselves and you.
1247	
1248	KING LEAR	Darkness and devils!
1249	Saddle my horses; call my train together:
1250	Degenerate bastard! I'll not trouble thee.
1251	Yet have I left a daughter.
1252	
1253	GONERIL	You strike my people; and your disorder'd rabble
1254	Make servants of their betters.
1255	
1256	[Enter ALBANY]
1257	
1258	KING LEAR	Woe, that too late repents,--
1259	
1260	[To ALBANY]
1261	
1262	O, sir, are you come?
1263	Is it your will? Speak, sir. Prepare my horses.
1264	Ingratitude, thou marble-hearted fiend,
1265	More hideous when thou show'st thee in a child
1266	Than the sea-monster!
1267	
1268	ALBANY	Pray, sir, be patient.
1269	
1270	KING LEAR	[To GONERIL]  Detested kite! thou liest.
1271	My train are men of choice and rarest parts,
1272	That all particulars of duty know,
1273	And in the most exact regard support
1274	The worships of their name. O most small fault,
1275	How ugly didst thou in Cordelia show!
1276	That, like an engine, wrench'd my frame of nature
1277	From the fix'd place; drew from heart all love,
1278	And added to the gall. O Lear, Lear, Lear!
1279	Beat at this gate, that let thy folly in,
1280	
1281	[Striking his head]
1282	
1283	And thy dear judgment out! Go, go, my people.
1284	
1285	ALBANY	My lord, I am guiltless, as I am ignorant
1286	Of what hath moved you.
1287	
1288	KING LEAR	It may be so, my lord.
1289	Hear, nature, hear; dear goddess, hear!
1290	Suspend thy purpose, if thou didst intend
1291	To make this creature fruitful!
1292	Into her womb convey sterility!
1293	Dry up in her the organs of increase;
1294	And from her derogate body never spring
1295	A babe to honour her! If she must teem,
1296	Create her child of spleen; that it may live,
1297	And be a thwart disnatured torment to her!
1298	Let it stamp wrinkles in her brow of youth;
1299	With cadent tears fret channels in her cheeks;
1300	Turn all her mother's pains and benefits
1301	To laughter and contempt; that she may feel
1302	How sharper than a serpent's tooth it is
1303	To have a thankless child! Away, away!
1304	
1305	[Exit]
1306	
1307	ALBANY	Now, gods that we adore, whereof comes this?
1308	
1309	GONERIL	Never afflict yourself to know the cause;
1310	But let his disposition have that scope
1311	That dotage gives it.
1312	
1313	[Re-enter KING LEAR]
1314	
1315	KING LEAR	What, fifty of my followers at a clap!
1316	Within a fortnight!
1317	
1318	ALBANY	What's the matter, sir?
1319	
1320	
1321	KING LEAR	I'll tell thee:
1322	
1323	[To GONERIL]
1324	
1325	Life and death! I am ashamed
1326	That thou hast power to shake my manhood thus;
1327	That these hot tears, which break from me perforce,
1328	Should make thee worth them. Blasts and fogs upon thee!
1329	The untented woundings of a father's curse
1330	Pierce every sense about thee! Old fond eyes,
1331	Beweep this cause again, I'll pluck ye out,
1332	And cast you, with the waters that you lose,
1333	To temper clay. Yea, it is come to this?
1334	Let is be so: yet have I left a daughter,
1335	Who, I am sure, is kind and comfortable:
1336	When she shall hear this of thee, with her nails
1337	She'll flay thy wolvish visage. Thou shalt find
1338	That I'll resume the shape which thou dost think
1339	I have cast off for ever: thou shalt,
1340	I warrant thee.
1341	
1342	[Exeunt KING LEAR, KENT, and Attendants]
1343	
1344	GONERIL	Do you mark that, my lord?
1345	
1346	ALBANY	I cannot be so partial, Goneril,
1347	To the great love I bear you,--
1348	
1349	GONERIL	Pray you, content. What, Oswald, ho!
1350	
1351	[To the Fool]
1352	
1353	You, sir, more knave than fool, after your master.
1354	
1355	Fool	Nuncle Lear, nuncle Lear, tarry and take the fool
1356	with thee.
1357	A fox, when one has caught her,
1358	And such a daughter,
1359	Should sure to the slaughter,
1360	If my cap would buy a halter:
1361	So the fool follows after.
1362	
1363	[Exit]
1364	
1365	GONERIL	This man hath had good counsel:--a hundred knights!
1366	'Tis politic and safe to let him keep
1367	At point a hundred knights: yes, that, on every dream,
1368	Each buzz, each fancy, each complaint, dislike,
1369	He may enguard his dotage with their powers,
1370	And hold our lives in mercy. Oswald, I say!
1371	
1372	ALBANY	Well, you may fear too far.
1373	
1374	GONERIL	Safer than trust too far:
1375	Let me still take away the harms I fear,
1376	Not fear still to be taken: I know his heart.
1377	What he hath utter'd I have writ my sister
1378	If she sustain him and his hundred knights
1379	When I have show'd the unfitness,--
1380	
1381	[Re-enter OSWALD]
1382	
1383	How now, Oswald!
1384	What, have you writ that letter to my sister?
1385	
1386	OSWALD	Yes, madam.
1387	
1388	GONERIL	Take you some company, and away to horse:
1389	Inform her full of my particular fear;
1390	And thereto add such reasons of your own
1391	As may compact it more. Get you gone;
1392	And hasten your return.
1393	
1394	[Exit OSWALD]
1395	
1396	No, no, my lord,
1397	This milky gentleness and course of yours
1398	Though I condemn not, yet, under pardon,
1399	You are much more attask'd for want of wisdom
1400	Than praised for harmful mildness.
1401	
1402	ALBANY	How far your eyes may pierce I can not tell:
1403	Striving to better, oft we mar what's well.
1404	
1405	GONERIL	Nay, then--
1406	
1407	ALBANY	Well, well; the event.

1422	
1423	
1424	[Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool]
1425	
1426	KING LEAR	Go you before to Gloucester with these letters.
1427	Acquaint my daughter no further with any thing you
1428	know than comes from her demand out of the letter.
1429	If your diligence be not speedy, I shall be there afore you.
1430	
1431	KENT	I will not sleep, my lord, till I have delivered
1432	your letter.
1433	
1434	[Exit]
1435	
1436	Fool	If a man's brains were in's heels, were't not in
1437	danger of kibes?
1438	
1439	KING LEAR	Ay, boy.
1440	
1441	Fool	Then, I prithee, be merry; thy wit shall ne'er go
1442	slip-shod.
1443	
1444	KING LEAR	Ha, ha, ha!
1445	
1446	Fool	Shalt see thy other daughter will use thee kindly;
1447	for though she's as like this as a crab's like an
1448	apple, yet I can tell what I can tell.
1449	
1450	KING LEAR	Why, what canst thou tell, my boy?
1451	
1452	Fool	She will taste as like this as a crab does to a
1453	crab. Thou canst tell why one's nose stands i'
1454	the middle on's face?
1455	
1456	KING LEAR	No.
1457	
1458	Fool	Why, to keep one's eyes of either side's nose; that
1459	what a man cannot smell out, he may spy into.
1460	
1461	KING LEAR	I did her wrong--
1462	
1463	Fool	Canst tell how an oyster makes his shell?
1464	
1465	KING LEAR	No.
1466	
1467	Fool	Nor I neither; but I can tell why a snail has a house.
1468	
1469	KING LEAR	Why?
1470	
1471	Fool	Why, to put his head in; not to give it away to his
1472	daughters, and leave his horns without a case.
1473	
1474	KING LEAR	I will forget my nature. So kind a father! Be my
1475	horses ready?
1476	
1477	Fool	Thy asses are gone about 'em. The reason why the
1478	seven stars are no more than seven is a pretty reason.
1479	
1480	KING LEAR	Because they are not eight?
1481	
1482	Fool	Yes, indeed: thou wouldst make a good fool.
1483	
1484	KING LEAR	To take 't again perforce! Monster ingratitude!
1485	
1486	Fool	If thou wert my fool, nuncle, I'ld have thee beaten
1487	for being old before thy time.
1488	
1489	KING LEAR	How's that?
1490	
1491	Fool	Thou shouldst not have been old till thou hadst
1492	been wise.
1493	
1494	KING LEAR	O, let me not be mad, not mad, sweet heaven
1495	Keep me in temper: I would not be mad!
1496	
1497	[Enter Gentleman]
1498	
1499	How now! are the horses ready?
1500	
1501	Gentleman	Ready, my lord.
1502	
1503	KING LEAR	Come, boy.
1504	
1505	Fool	She that's a maid now, and laughs at my departure,
1506	Shall not be a maid long, unless things be cut shorter.

1522	
1523	[Enter EDMUND, and CURAN meets him]
1524	
1525	EDMUND	Save thee, Curan.
1526	
1527	CURAN	And you, sir. I have been with your father, and
1528	given him notice that the Duke of Cornwall and Regan
1529	his duchess will be here with him this night.
1530	
1531	EDMUND	How comes that?
1532	
1533	CURAN	Nay, I know not. You have heard of the news abroad;
1534	I mean the whispered ones, for they are yet but
1535	ear-kissing arguments?
1536	
1537	EDMUND	Not I	pray you, what are they?
1538	
1539	CURAN	Have you heard of no likely wars toward, 'twixt the
1540	Dukes of Cornwall and Albany?
1541	
1542	EDMUND	Not a word.
1543	
1544	CURAN	You may do, then, in time. Fare you well, sir.
1545	
1546	[Exit]
1547	
1548	EDMUND	The duke be here to-night? The better! best!
1549	This weaves itself perforce into my business.
1550	My father hath set guard to take my brother;
1551	And I have one thing, of a queasy question,
1552	Which I must act: briefness and fortune, work!
1553	Brother, a word; descend: brother, I say!
1554	
1555	[Enter EDGAR]
1556	
1557	My father watches: O sir, fly this place;
1558	Intelligence is given where you are hid;
1559	You have now the good advantage of the night:
1560	Have you not spoken 'gainst the Duke of Cornwall?
1561	He's coming hither: now, i' the night, i' the haste,
1562	And Regan with him: have you nothing said
1563	Upon his party 'gainst the Duke of Albany?
1564	Advise yourself.
1565	
1566	EDGAR	                  I am sure on't, not a word.
1567	
1568	EDMUND	I hear my father coming: pardon me:
1569	In cunning I must draw my sword upon you
1570	Draw; seem to defend yourself; now quit you well.
1571	Yield: come before my father. Light, ho, here!
1572	Fly, brother. Torches, torches! So, farewell.
1573	
1574	[Exit EDGAR]
1575	
1576	Some blood drawn on me would beget opinion.
1577	
1578	[Wounds his arm]
1579	
1580	Of my more fierce endeavour: I have seen drunkards
1581	Do more than this in sport. Father, father!
1582	Stop, stop! No help?
1583	
1584	[Enter GLOUCESTER, and Servants with torches]
1585	
1586	GLOUCESTER	Now, Edmund, where's the villain?
1587	
1588	EDMUND	Here stood he in the dark, his sharp sword out,
1589	Mumbling of wicked charms, conjuring the moon
1590	To stand auspicious mistress,--
1591	
1592	GLOUCESTER	But where is he?
1593	
1594	EDMUND	Look, sir, I bleed.
1595	
1596	GLOUCESTER	Where is the villain, Edmund?
1597	
1598	EDMUND	Fled this way, sir. When by no means he could--
1599	
1600	GLOUCESTER	Pursue him, ho! Go after.
1601	
1602	[Exeunt some Servants]
1603	
1604	By no means what?
1605	
1606	EDMUND	Persuade me to the murder of your lordship;
1607	But that I told him, the revenging gods
1608	'Gainst parricides did all their thunders bend;
1609	Spoke, with how manifold and strong a bond
1610	The child was bound to the father; sir, in fine,
1611	Seeing how loathly opposite I stood
1612	To his unnatural purpose, in fell motion,
1613	With his prepared sword, he charges home
1614	My unprovided body, lanced mine arm:
1615	But when he saw my best alarum'd spirits,
1616	Bold in the quarrel's right, roused to the encounter,
1617	Or whether gasted by the noise I made,
1618	Full suddenly he fled.
1619	
1620	GLOUCESTER	Let him fly far:
1621	Not in this land shall he remain uncaught;
1622	And found--dispatch. The noble duke my master,
1623	My worthy arch and patron, comes to-night:
1624	By his authority I will proclaim it,
1625	That he which finds him shall deserve our thanks,
1626	Bringing the murderous coward to the stake;
1627	He that conceals him, death.
1628	
1629	EDMUND	When I dissuaded him from his intent,
1630	And found him pight to do it, with curst speech
1631	I threaten'd to discover him: he replied,
1632	'Thou unpossessing bastard! dost thou think,
1633	If I would stand against thee, would the reposal
1634	Of any trust, virtue, or worth in thee
1635	Make thy words faith'd? No: what I should deny,--
1636	As this I would: ay, though thou didst produce
1637	My very character,--I'ld turn it all
1638	To thy suggestion, plot, and damned practise:
1639	And thou must make a dullard of the world,
1640	If they not thought the profits of my death
1641	Were very pregnant and potential spurs
1642	To make thee seek it.'
1643	
1644	GLOUCESTER	Strong and fasten'd villain
1645	Would he deny his letter? I never got him.
1646	
1647	[Tucket within]
1648	
1649	Hark, the duke's trumpets! I know not why he comes.
1650	All ports I'll bar; the villain shall not 'scape;
1651	The duke must grant me that: besides, his picture
1652	I will send far and near, that all the kingdom
1653	May have the due note of him; and of my land,
1654	Loyal and natural boy, I'll work the means
1655	To make thee capable.
1656	
1657	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, and Attendants]
1658	
1659	CORNWALL	How now, my noble friend! since I came hither,
1660	Which I can call but now, I have heard strange news.
1661	
1662	REGAN	If it be true, all vengeance comes too short
1663	Which can pursue the offender. How dost, my lord?
1664	
1665	GLOUCESTER	O, madam, my old heart is crack'd, it's crack'd!
1666	
1667	REGAN	What, did my father's godson seek your life?
1668	He whom my father named? your Edgar?
1669	
1670	GLOUCESTER	O, lady, lady, shame would have it hid!
1671	
1672	REGAN	Was he not companion with the riotous knights
1673	That tend upon my father?
1674	
1675	GLOUCESTER	I know not, madam: 'tis too bad, too bad.
1676	
1677	EDMUND	Yes, madam, he was of that consort.
1678	
1679	REGAN	No marvel, then, though he were ill affected:
1680	'Tis they have put him on the old man's death,
1681	To have the expense and waste of his revenues.
1682	I have this present evening from my sister
1683	Been well inform'd of them; and with such cautions,
1684	That if they come to sojourn at my house,
1685	I'll not be there.
1686	
1687	CORNWALL	Nor I, assure thee, Regan.
1688	Edmund, I hear that you have shown your father
1689	A child-like office.
1690	
1691	EDMUND	'Twas my duty, sir.
1692	
1693	GLOUCESTER	He did bewray his practise; and received
1694	This hurt you see, striving to apprehend him.
1695	
1696	CORNWALL	Is he pursued?
1697	
1698	GLOUCESTER	                  Ay, my good lord.
1699	
1700	CORNWALL	If he be taken, he shall never more
1701	Be fear'd of doing harm: make your own purpose,
1702	How in my strength you please. For you, Edmund,
1703	Whose virtue and obedience doth this instant
1704	So much commend itself, you shall be ours:
1705	Natures of such deep trust we shall much need;
1706	You we first seize on.
1707	
1708	EDMUND	I shall serve you, sir,
1709	Truly, however else.
1710	
1711	GLOUCESTER	For him I thank your grace.
1712	
1713	CORNWALL	You know not why we came to visit you,--
1714	
1715	REGAN	Thus out of season, threading dark-eyed night:
1716	Occasions, noble Gloucester, of some poise,
1717	Wherein we must have use of your advice:
1718	Our father he hath writ, so hath our sister,
1719	Of differences, which I least thought it fit
1720	To answer from our home; the several messengers
1721	From hence attend dispatch. Our good old friend,
1722	Lay comforts to your bosom; and bestow
1723	Your needful counsel to our business,
1724	Which craves the instant use.
1725	
1726	GLOUCESTER	I serve you, madam:
1727	Your graces are right welcome.

1737	ACT II
1738	
1739	
1740	
1741	SCENE II	Before Gloucester's castle.
1742	
1743	
1744	[Enter KENT and OSWALD, severally]
1745	
1746	OSWALD	Good dawning to thee, friend: art of this house?
1747	
1748	KENT	Ay.
1749	
1750	OSWALD	Where may we set our horses?
1751	
1752	KENT	I' the mire.
1753	
1754	OSWALD	Prithee, if thou lovest me, tell me.
1755	
1756	KENT	I love thee not.
1757	
1758	OSWALD	Why, then, I care not for thee.
1759	
1760	KENT	If I had thee in Lipsbury pinfold, I would make thee
1761	care for me.
1762	
1763	OSWALD	Why dost thou use me thus? I know thee not.
1764	
1765	KENT	Fellow, I know thee.
1766	
1767	OSWALD	What dost thou know me for?
1768	
1769	KENT	A knave; a rascal; an eater of broken meats; a
1770	base, proud, shallow, beggarly, three-suited,
1771	hundred-pound, filthy, worsted-stocking knave; a
1772	lily-livered, action-taking knave, a whoreson,
1773	glass-gazing, super-serviceable finical rogue;
1774	one-trunk-inheriting slave; one that wouldst be a
1775	bawd, in way of good service, and art nothing but
1776	the composition of a knave, beggar, coward, pandar,
1777	and the son and heir of a mongrel bitch: one whom I
1778	will beat into clamorous whining, if thou deniest
1779	the least syllable of thy addition.
1780	
1781	OSWALD	Why, what a monstrous fellow art thou, thus to rail
1782	on one that is neither known of thee nor knows thee!
1783	
1784	KENT	What a brazen-faced varlet art thou, to deny thou
1785	knowest me! Is it two days ago since I tripped up
1786	thy heels, and beat thee before the king? Draw, you
1787	rogue: for, though it be night, yet the moon
1788	shines; I'll make a sop o' the moonshine of you:
1789	draw, you whoreson cullionly barber-monger, draw.
1790	
1791	[Drawing his sword]
1792	
1793	OSWALD	Away! I have nothing to do with thee.
1794	
1795	KENT	Draw, you rascal: you come with letters against the
1796	king; and take vanity the puppet's part against the
1797	royalty of her father: draw, you rogue, or I'll so
1798	carbonado your shanks: draw, you rascal; come your ways.
1799	
1800	OSWALD	Help, ho! murder! help!
1801	
1802	KENT	Strike, you slave; stand, rogue, stand; you neat
1803	slave, strike.
1804	
1805	[Beating him]
1806	
1807	OSWALD	Help, ho! murder! murder!
1808	
1809	[Enter EDMUND, with his rapier drawn, CORNWALL,
1810	REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants]
1811	
1812	EDMUND	How now! What's the matter?
1813	
1814	KENT	With you, goodman boy, an you please: come, I'll
1815	flesh ye; come on, young master.
1816	
1817	GLOUCESTER	Weapons! arms! What 's the matter here?
1818	
1819	CORNWALL	Keep peace, upon your lives:
1820	He dies that strikes again. What is the matter?
1821	
1822	REGAN	The messengers from our sister and the king.
1823	
1824	CORNWALL	What is your difference? speak.
1825	
1826	OSWALD	I am scarce in breath, my lord.
1827	
1828	KENT	No marvel, you have so bestirred your valour. You
1829	cowardly rascal, nature disclaims in thee: a
1830	tailor made thee.
1831	
1832	CORNWALL	Thou art a strange fellow: a tailor make a man?
1833	
1834	KENT	Ay, a tailor, sir: a stone-cutter or painter could
1835	not have made him so ill, though he had been but two
1836	hours at the trade.
1837	
1838	CORNWALL	Speak yet, how grew your quarrel?
1839	
1840	OSWALD	This ancient ruffian, sir, whose life I have spared
1841	at suit of his gray beard,--
1842	
1843	KENT	Thou whoreson zed! thou unnecessary letter! My
1844	lord, if you will give me leave, I will tread this
1845	unbolted villain into mortar, and daub the wall of
1846	a jakes with him. Spare my gray beard, you wagtail?
1847	
1848	CORNWALL	Peace, sirrah!
1849	You beastly knave, know you no reverence?
1850	
1851	KENT	Yes, sir; but anger hath a privilege.
1852	
1853	CORNWALL	Why art thou angry?
1854	
1855	KENT	That such a slave as this should wear a sword,
1856	Who wears no honesty. Such smiling rogues as these,
1857	Like rats, oft bite the holy cords a-twain
1858	Which are too intrinse t' unloose; smooth every passion
1859	That in the natures of their lords rebel;
1860	Bring oil to fire, snow to their colder moods;
1861	Renege, affirm, and turn their halcyon beaks
1862	With every gale and vary of their masters,
1863	Knowing nought, like dogs, but following.
1864	A plague upon your epileptic visage!
1865	Smile you my speeches, as I were a fool?
1866	Goose, if I had you upon Sarum plain,
1867	I'ld drive ye cackling home to Camelot.
1868	
1869	CORNWALL	Why, art thou mad, old fellow?
1870	
1871	GLOUCESTER	How fell you out? say that.
1872	
1873	KENT	No contraries hold more antipathy
1874	Than I and such a knave.
1875	
1876	CORNWALL	Why dost thou call him a knave?  What's his offence?
1877	
1878	KENT	His countenance likes me not.
1879	
1880	CORNWALL	No more, perchance, does mine, nor his, nor hers.
1881	
1882	KENT	Sir, 'tis my occupation to be plain:
1883	I have seen better faces in my time
1884	Than stands on any shoulder that I see
1885	Before me at this instant.
1886	
1887	CORNWALL	This is some fellow,
1888	Who, having been praised for bluntness, doth affect
1889	A saucy roughness, and constrains the garb
1890	Quite from his nature: he cannot flatter, he,
1891	An honest mind and plain, he must speak truth!
1892	An they will take it, so; if not, he's plain.
1893	These kind of knaves I know, which in this plainness
1894	Harbour more craft and more corrupter ends
1895	Than twenty silly ducking observants
1896	That stretch their duties nicely.
1897	
1898	KENT	Sir, in good sooth, in sincere verity,
1899	Under the allowance of your great aspect,
1900	Whose influence, like the wreath of radiant fire
1901	On flickering Phoebus' front,--
1902	
1903	CORNWALL	What mean'st by this?
1904	
1905	KENT	To go out of my dialect, which you
1906	discommend so much. I know, sir, I am no
1907	flatterer: he that beguiled you in a plain
1908	accent was a plain knave; which for my part
1909	I will not be, though I should win your displeasure
1910	to entreat me to 't.
1911	
1912	CORNWALL	What was the offence you gave him?
1913	
1914	OSWALD	I never gave him any:
1915	It pleased the king his master very late
1916	To strike at me, upon his misconstruction;
1917	When he, conjunct and flattering his displeasure,
1918	Tripp'd me behind; being down, insulted, rail'd,
1919	And put upon him such a deal of man,
1920	That worthied him, got praises of the king
1921	For him attempting who was self-subdued;
1922	And, in the fleshment of this dread exploit,
1923	Drew on me here again.
1924	
1925	KENT	None of these rogues and cowards
1926	But Ajax is their fool.
1927	
1928	CORNWALL	Fetch forth the stocks!
1929	You stubborn ancient knave, you reverend braggart,
1930	We'll teach you--
1931	
1932	KENT	                  Sir, I am too old to learn:
1933	Call not your stocks for me: I serve the king;
1934	On whose employment I was sent to you:
1935	You shall do small respect, show too bold malice
1936	Against the grace and person of my master,
1937	Stocking his messenger.
1938	
1939	CORNWALL	Fetch forth the stocks! As I have life and honour,
1940	There shall he sit till noon.
1941	
1942	REGAN	Till noon! till night, my lord; and all night too.
1943	
1944	KENT	Why, madam, if I were your father's dog,
1945	You should not use me so.
1946	
1947	REGAN	Sir, being his knave, I will.
1948	
1949	CORNWALL	This is a fellow of the self-same colour
1950	Our sister speaks of. Come, bring away the stocks!
1951	
1952	[Stocks brought out]
1953	
1954	GLOUCESTER	Let me beseech your grace not to do so:
1955	His fault is much, and the good king his master
1956	Will cheque him for 't: your purposed low correction
1957	Is such as basest and contemned'st wretches
1958	For pilferings and most common trespasses
1959	Are punish'd with: the king must take it ill,
1960	That he's so slightly valued in his messenger,
1961	Should have him thus restrain'd.
1962	
1963	CORNWALL	I'll answer that.
1964	
1965	REGAN	My sister may receive it much more worse,
1966	To have her gentleman abused, assaulted,
1967	For following her affairs. Put in his legs.
1968	
1969	[KENT is put in the stocks]
1970	
1971	Come, my good lord, away.
1972	
1973	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER and KENT]
1974	
1975	GLOUCESTER	I am sorry for thee, friend; 'tis the duke's pleasure,
1976	Whose disposition, all the world well knows,
1977	Will not be rubb'd nor stopp'd: I'll entreat for thee.
1978	
1979	KENT	Pray, do not, sir: I have watched and travell'd hard;
1980	Some time I shall sleep out, the rest I'll whistle.
1981	A good man's fortune may grow out at heels:
1982	Give you good morrow!
1983	
1984	GLOUCESTER	The duke's to blame in this; 'twill be ill taken.
1985	
1986	[Exit]
1987	
1988	KENT	Good king, that must approve the common saw,
1989	Thou out of heaven's benediction comest
1990	To the warm sun!
1991	Approach, thou beacon to this under globe,
1992	That by thy comfortable beams I may
1993	Peruse this letter! Nothing almost sees miracles
1994	But misery: I know 'tis from Cordelia,
1995	Who hath most fortunately been inform'd
1996	Of my obscured course; and shall find time
1997	From this enormous state, seeking to give
1998	Losses their remedies. All weary and o'erwatch'd,
1999	Take vantage, heavy eyes, not to behold
2000	This shameful lodging.
2001	Fortune, good night: smile once more: turn thy wheel!

2017	
2018	[Enter EDGAR]
2019	
2020	EDGAR	I heard myself proclaim'd;
2021	And by the happy hollow of a tree
2022	Escaped the hunt. No port is free; no place,
2023	That guard, and most unusual vigilance,
2024	Does not attend my taking. Whiles I may 'scape,
2025	I will preserve myself: and am bethought
2026	To take the basest and most poorest shape
2027	That ever penury, in contempt of man,
2028	Brought near to beast: my face I'll grime with filth;
2029	Blanket my loins: elf all my hair in knots;
2030	And with presented nakedness out-face
2031	The winds and persecutions of the sky.
2032	The country gives me proof and precedent
2033	Of Bedlam beggars, who, with roaring voices,
2034	Strike in their numb'd and mortified bare arms
2035	Pins, wooden pricks, nails, sprigs of rosemary;
2036	And with this horrible object, from low farms,
2037	Poor pelting villages, sheep-cotes, and mills,
2038	Sometime with lunatic bans, sometime with prayers,
2039	Enforce their charity. Poor Turlygod! poor Tom!
2040	That's something yet: Edgar I nothing am.

2056	
2057	[Enter KING LEAR, Fool, and Gentleman]
2058	
2059	KING LEAR	'Tis strange that they should so depart from home,
2060	And not send back my messenger.
2061	
2062	Gentleman	As I learn'd,
2063	The night before there was no purpose in them
2064	Of this remove.
2065	
2066	KENT	                  Hail to thee, noble master!
2067	
2068	KING LEAR	Ha!
2069	Makest thou this shame thy pastime?
2070	
2071	KENT	No, my lord.
2072	
2073	Fool	Ha, ha! he wears cruel garters. Horses are tied
2074	by the heads, dogs and bears by the neck, monkeys by
2075	the loins, and men by the legs: when a man's
2076	over-lusty at legs, then he wears wooden
2077	nether-stocks.
2078	
2079	KING LEAR	What's he that hath so much thy place mistook
2080	To set thee here?
2081	
2082	KENT	                  It is both he and she;
2083	Your son and daughter.
2084	
2085	KING LEAR	No.
2086	
2087	KENT	Yes.
2088	
2089	KING LEAR	No, I say.
2090	
2091	KENT	I say, yea.
2092	
2093	KING LEAR	No, no, they would not.
2094	
2095	KENT	Yes, they have.
2096	
2097	KING LEAR	By Jupiter, I swear, no.
2098	
2099	KENT	By Juno, I swear, ay.
2100	
2101	KING LEAR	They durst not do 't;
2102	They could not, would not do 't; 'tis worse than murder,
2103	To do upon respect such violent outrage:
2104	Resolve me, with all modest haste, which way
2105	Thou mightst deserve, or they impose, this usage,
2106	Coming from us.
2107	
2108	KENT	                  My lord, when at their home
2109	I did commend your highness' letters to them,
2110	Ere I was risen from the place that show'd
2111	My duty kneeling, came there a reeking post,
2112	Stew'd in his haste, half breathless, panting forth
2113	From Goneril his mistress salutations;
2114	Deliver'd letters, spite of intermission,
2115	Which presently they read: on whose contents,
2116	They summon'd up their meiny, straight took horse;
2117	Commanded me to follow, and attend
2118	The leisure of their answer; gave me cold looks:
2119	And meeting here the other messenger,
2120	Whose welcome, I perceived, had poison'd mine,--
2121	Being the very fellow that of late
2122	Display'd so saucily against your highness,--
2123	Having more man than wit about me, drew:
2124	He raised the house with loud and coward cries.
2125	Your son and daughter found this trespass worth
2126	The shame which here it suffers.
2127	
2128	Fool	Winter's not gone yet, if the wild-geese fly that way.
2129	Fathers that wear rags
2130	Do make their children blind;
2131	But fathers that bear bags
2132	Shall see their children kind.
2133	Fortune, that arrant whore,
2134	Ne'er turns the key to the poor.
2135	But, for all this, thou shalt have as many dolours
2136	for thy daughters as thou canst tell in a year.
2137	
2138	KING LEAR	O, how this mother swells up toward my heart!
2139	Hysterica passio, down, thou climbing sorrow,
2140	Thy element's below! Where is this daughter?
2141	
2142	KENT	With the earl, sir, here within.
2143	
2144	KING LEAR	Follow me not;
2145	Stay here.
2146	
2147	[Exit]
2148	
2149	Gentleman	Made you no more offence but what you speak of?
2150	
2151	KENT	None.
2152	How chance the king comes with so small a train?
2153	
2154	Fool	And thou hadst been set i' the stocks for that
2155	question, thou hadst well deserved it.
2156	
2157	KENT	Why, fool?
2158	
2159	Fool	We'll set thee to school to an ant, to teach thee
2160	there's no labouring i' the winter. All that follow
2161	their noses are led by their eyes but blind men; and
2162	there's not a nose among twenty but can smell him
2163	that's stinking. Let go thy hold when a great wheel
2164	runs down a hill, lest it break thy neck with
2165	following it: but the great one that goes up the
2166	hill, let him draw thee after. When a wise man
2167	gives thee better counsel, give me mine again: I
2168	would have none but knaves follow it, since a fool gives it.
2169	That sir which serves and seeks for gain,
2170	And follows but for form,
2171	Will pack when it begins to rain,
2172	And leave thee in the storm,
2173	But I will tarry; the fool will stay,
2174	And let the wise man fly:
2175	The knave turns fool that runs away;
2176	The fool no knave, perdy.
2177	
2178	KENT	Where learned you this, fool?
2179	
2180	Fool	Not i' the stocks, fool.
2181	
2182	[Re-enter KING LEAR with GLOUCESTER]
2183	
2184	KING LEAR	Deny to speak with me? They are sick? they are weary?
2185	They have travell'd all the night? Mere fetches;
2186	The images of revolt and flying off.
2187	Fetch me a better answer.
2188	
2189	GLOUCESTER	My dear lord,
2190	You know the fiery quality of the duke;
2191	How unremoveable and fix'd he is
2192	In his own course.
2193	
2194	KING LEAR	Vengeance! plague! death! confusion!
2195	Fiery? what quality? Why, Gloucester, Gloucester,
2196	I'ld speak with the Duke of Cornwall and his wife.
2197	
2198	GLOUCESTER	Well, my good lord, I have inform'd them so.
2199	
2200	KING LEAR	Inform'd them! Dost thou understand me, man?
2201	
2202	GLOUCESTER	Ay, my good lord.
2203	
2204	KING LEAR	The king would speak with Cornwall; the dear father
2205	Would with his daughter speak, commands her service:
2206	Are they inform'd of this? My breath and blood!
2207	Fiery? the fiery duke? Tell the hot duke that--
2208	No, but not yet: may be he is not well:
2209	Infirmity doth still neglect all office
2210	Whereto our health is bound; we are not ourselves
2211	When nature, being oppress'd, commands the mind
2212	To suffer with the body: I'll forbear;
2213	And am fall'n out with my more headier will,
2214	To take the indisposed and sickly fit
2215	For the sound man. Death on my state! wherefore
2216	
2217	[Looking on KENT]
2218	
2219	Should he sit here? This act persuades me
2220	That this remotion of the duke and her
2221	Is practise only. Give me my servant forth.
2222	Go tell the duke and 's wife I'ld speak with them,
2223	Now, presently: bid them come forth and hear me,
2224	Or at their chamber-door I'll beat the drum
2225	Till it cry sleep to death.
2226	
2227	GLOUCESTER	I would have all well betwixt you.
2228	
2229	[Exit]
2230	
2231	KING LEAR	O me, my heart, my rising heart! but, down!
2232	
2233	Fool	Cry to it, nuncle, as the cockney did to the eels
2234	when she put 'em i' the paste alive; she knapped 'em
2235	o' the coxcombs with a stick, and cried 'Down,
2236	wantons, down!' 'Twas her brother that, in pure
2237	kindness to his horse, buttered his hay.
2238	
2239	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GLOUCESTER, and Servants]
2240	
2241	KING LEAR	Good morrow to you both.
2242	
2243	CORNWALL	Hail to your grace!
2244	
2245	[KENT is set at liberty]
2246	
2247	REGAN	I am glad to see your highness.
2248	
2249	KING LEAR	Regan, I think you are; I know what reason
2250	I have to think so: if thou shouldst not be glad,
2251	I would divorce me from thy mother's tomb,
2252	Sepulchring an adultress.
2253	
2254	[To KENT]
2255	
2256	O, are you free?
2257	Some other time for that. Beloved Regan,
2258	Thy sister's naught: O Regan, she hath tied
2259	Sharp-tooth'd unkindness, like a vulture, here:
2260	
2261	[Points to his heart]
2262	
2263	I can scarce speak to thee; thou'lt not believe
2264	With how depraved a quality--O Regan!
2265	
2266	REGAN	I pray you, sir, take patience: I have hope.
2267	You less know how to value her desert
2268	Than she to scant her duty.
2269	
2270	KING LEAR	Say, how is that?
2271	
2272	REGAN	I cannot think my sister in the least
2273	Would fail her obligation: if, sir, perchance
2274	She have restrain'd the riots of your followers,
2275	'Tis on such ground, and to such wholesome end,
2276	As clears her from all blame.
2277	
2278	KING LEAR	My curses on her!
2279	
2280	REGAN	                  O, sir, you are old.
2281	Nature in you stands on the very verge
2282	Of her confine: you should be ruled and led
2283	By some discretion, that discerns your state
2284	Better than you yourself. Therefore, I pray you,
2285	That to our sister you do make return;
2286	Say you have wrong'd her, sir.
2287	
2288	KING LEAR	Ask her forgiveness?
2289	Do you but mark how this becomes the house:
2290	'Dear daughter, I confess that I am old;
2291	
2292	[Kneeling]
2293	
2294	Age is unnecessary: on my knees I beg
2295	That you'll vouchsafe me raiment, bed, and food.'
2296	
2297	REGAN	Good sir, no more; these are unsightly tricks:
2298	Return you to my sister.
2299	
2300	KING LEAR	[Rising]  Never, Regan:
2301	She hath abated me of half my train;
2302	Look'd black upon me; struck me with her tongue,
2303	Most serpent-like, upon the very heart:
2304	All the stored vengeances of heaven fall
2305	On her ingrateful top! Strike her young bones,
2306	You taking airs, with lameness!
2307	
2308	CORNWALL	Fie, sir, fie!
2309	
2310	KING LEAR	You nimble lightnings, dart your blinding flames
2311	Into her scornful eyes! Infect her beauty,
2312	You fen-suck'd fogs, drawn by the powerful sun,
2313	To fall and blast her pride!
2314	
2315	REGAN	O the blest gods! so will you wish on me,
2316	When the rash mood is on.
2317	
2318	KING LEAR	No, Regan, thou shalt never have my curse:
2319	Thy tender-hefted nature shall not give
2320	Thee o'er to harshness: her eyes are fierce; but thine
2321	Do comfort and not burn. 'Tis not in thee
2322	To grudge my pleasures, to cut off my train,
2323	To bandy hasty words, to scant my sizes,
2324	And in conclusion to oppose the bolt
2325	Against my coming in: thou better know'st
2326	The offices of nature, bond of childhood,
2327	Effects of courtesy, dues of gratitude;
2328	Thy half o' the kingdom hast thou not forgot,
2329	Wherein I thee endow'd.
2330	
2331	REGAN	Good sir, to the purpose.
2332	
2333	KING LEAR	Who put my man i' the stocks?
2334	
2335	[Tucket within]
2336	
2337	CORNWALL	What trumpet's that?
2338	
2339	REGAN	I know't, my sister's: this approves her letter,
2340	That she would soon be here.
2341	
2342	[Enter OSWALD]
2343	
2344	Is your lady come?
2345	
2346	KING LEAR	This is a slave, whose easy-borrow'd pride
2347	Dwells in the fickle grace of her he follows.
2348	Out, varlet, from my sight!
2349	
2350	CORNWALL	What means your grace?
2351	
2352	KING LEAR	Who stock'd my servant? Regan, I have good hope
2353	Thou didst not know on't. Who comes here? O heavens,
2354	
2355	[Enter GONERIL]
2356	
2357	If you do love old men, if your sweet sway
2358	Allow obedience, if yourselves are old,
2359	Make it your cause; send down, and take my part!
2360	
2361	[To GONERIL]
2362	
2363	Art not ashamed to look upon this beard?
2364	O Regan, wilt thou take her by the hand?
2365	
2366	GONERIL	Why not by the hand, sir? How have I offended?
2367	All's not offence that indiscretion finds
2368	And dotage terms so.
2369	
2370	KING LEAR	O sides, you are too tough;
2371	Will you yet hold? How came my man i' the stocks?
2372	
2373	CORNWALL	I set him there, sir: but his own disorders
2374	Deserved much less advancement.
2375	
2376	KING LEAR	You! did you?
2377	
2378	REGAN	I pray you, father, being weak, seem so.
2379	If, till the expiration of your month,
2380	You will return and sojourn with my sister,
2381	Dismissing half your train, come then to me:
2382	I am now from home, and out of that provision
2383	Which shall be needful for your entertainment.
2384	
2385	KING LEAR	Return to her, and fifty men dismiss'd?
2386	No, rather I abjure all roofs, and choose
2387	To wage against the enmity o' the air;
2388	To be a comrade with the wolf and owl,--
2389	Necessity's sharp pinch! Return with her?
2390	Why, the hot-blooded France, that dowerless took
2391	Our youngest born, I could as well be brought
2392	To knee his throne, and, squire-like; pension beg
2393	To keep base life afoot. Return with her?
2394	Persuade me rather to be slave and sumpter
2395	To this detested groom.
2396	
2397	[Pointing at OSWALD]
2398	
2399	GONERIL	At your choice, sir.
2400	
2401	KING LEAR	I prithee, daughter, do not make me mad:
2402	I will not trouble thee, my child; farewell:
2403	We'll no more meet, no more see one another:
2404	But yet thou art my flesh, my blood, my daughter;
2405	Or rather a disease that's in my flesh,
2406	Which I must needs call mine: thou art a boil,
2407	A plague-sore, an embossed carbuncle,
2408	In my corrupted blood. But I'll not chide thee;
2409	Let shame come when it will, I do not call it:
2410	I do not bid the thunder-bearer shoot,
2411	Nor tell tales of thee to high-judging Jove:
2412	Mend when thou canst; be better at thy leisure:
2413	I can be patient; I can stay with Regan,
2414	I and my hundred knights.
2415	
2416	REGAN	Not altogether so:
2417	I look'd not for you yet, nor am provided
2418	For your fit welcome. Give ear, sir, to my sister;
2419	For those that mingle reason with your passion
2420	Must be content to think you old, and so--
2421	But she knows what she does.
2422	
2423	KING LEAR	Is this well spoken?
2424	
2425	REGAN	I dare avouch it, sir: what, fifty followers?
2426	Is it not well? What should you need of more?
2427	Yea, or so many, sith that both charge and danger
2428	Speak 'gainst so great a number? How, in one house,
2429	Should many people, under two commands,
2430	Hold amity? 'Tis hard; almost impossible.
2431	
2432	GONERIL	Why might not you, my lord, receive attendance
2433	From those that she calls servants or from mine?
2434	
2435	REGAN	Why not, my lord? If then they chanced to slack you,
2436	We could control them. If you will come to me,--
2437	For now I spy a danger,--I entreat you
2438	To bring but five and twenty: to no more
2439	Will I give place or notice.
2440	
2441	KING LEAR	I gave you all--
2442	
2443	REGAN	                  And in good time you gave it.
2444	
2445	KING LEAR	Made you my guardians, my depositaries;
2446	But kept a reservation to be follow'd
2447	With such a number. What, must I come to you
2448	With five and twenty, Regan? said you so?
2449	
2450	REGAN	And speak't again, my lord; no more with me.
2451	
2452	KING LEAR	Those wicked creatures yet do look well-favour'd,
2453	When others are more wicked: not being the worst
2454	Stands in some rank of praise.
2455	
2456	[To GONERIL]
2457	
2458	I'll go with thee:
2459	Thy fifty yet doth double five and twenty,
2460	And thou art twice her love.
2461	
2462	GONERIL	Hear me, my lord;
2463	What need you five and twenty, ten, or five,
2464	To follow in a house where twice so many
2465	Have a command to tend you?
2466	
2467	REGAN	What need one?
2468	
2469	KING LEAR	O, reason not the need: our basest beggars
2470	Are in the poorest thing superfluous:
2471	Allow not nature more than nature needs,
2472	Man's life's as cheap as beast's: thou art a lady;
2473	If only to go warm were gorgeous,
2474	Why, nature needs not what thou gorgeous wear'st,
2475	Which scarcely keeps thee warm. But, for true need,--
2476	You heavens, give me that patience, patience I need!
2477	You see me here, you gods, a poor old man,
2478	As full of grief as age; wretched in both!
2479	If it be you that stir these daughters' hearts
2480	Against their father, fool me not so much
2481	To bear it tamely; touch me with noble anger,
2482	And let not women's weapons, water-drops,
2483	Stain my man's cheeks! No, you unnatural hags,
2484	I will have such revenges on you both,
2485	That all the world shall--I will do such things,--
2486	What they are, yet I know not: but they shall be
2487	The terrors of the earth. You think I'll weep
2488	No, I'll not weep:
2489	I have full cause of weeping; but this heart
2490	Shall break into a hundred thousand flaws,
2491	Or ere I'll weep. O fool, I shall go mad!
2492	
2493	[Exeunt KING LEAR, GLOUCESTER, KENT, and Fool]
2494	
2495	[Storm and tempest]
2496	
2497	CORNWALL	Let us withdraw; 'twill be a storm.
2498	
2499	REGAN	This house is little: the old man and his people
2500	Cannot be well bestow'd.
2501	
2502	GONERIL	'Tis his own blame; hath put himself from rest,
2503	And must needs taste his folly.
2504	
2505	REGAN	For his particular, I'll receive him gladly,
2506	But not one follower.
2507	
2508	GONERIL	So am I purposed.
2509	Where is my lord of Gloucester?
2510	
2511	CORNWALL	Follow'd the old man forth: he is return'd.
2512	
2513	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]
2514	
2515	GLOUCESTER	The king is in high rage.
2516	
2517	CORNWALL	Whither is he going?
2518	
2519	GLOUCESTER	He calls to horse; but will I know not whither.
2520	
2521	CORNWALL	'Tis best to give him way; he leads himself.
2522	
2523	GONERIL	My lord, entreat him by no means to stay.
2524	
2525	GLOUCESTER	Alack, the night comes on, and the bleak winds
2526	Do sorely ruffle; for many miles about
2527	There's scarce a bush.
2528	
2529	REGAN	O, sir, to wilful men,
2530	The injuries that they themselves procure
2531	Must be their schoolmasters. Shut up your doors:
2532	He is attended with a desperate train;
2533	And what they may incense him to, being apt
2534	To have his ear abused, wisdom bids fear.
2535	
2536	CORNWALL	Shut up your doors, my lord; 'tis a wild night:
2537	My Regan counsels well; come out o' the storm.

2546	ACT III
2547	
2548	
2549	
2550	SCENE I	A heath.
2551	
2552	
2553	[Storm still. Enter KENT and a Gentleman, meeting]
2554	
2555	KENT	Who's there, besides foul weather?
2556	
2557	Gentleman	One minded like the weather, most unquietly.
2558	
2559	KENT	I know you. Where's the king?
2560	
2561	Gentleman	Contending with the fretful element:
2562	Bids the winds blow the earth into the sea,
2563	Or swell the curled water 'bove the main,
2564	That things might change or cease; tears his white hair,
2565	Which the impetuous blasts, with eyeless rage,
2566	Catch in their fury, and make nothing of;
2567	Strives in his little world of man to out-scorn
2568	The to-and-fro-conflicting wind and rain.
2569	This night, wherein the cub-drawn bear would couch,
2570	The lion and the belly-pinched wolf
2571	Keep their fur dry, unbonneted he runs,
2572	And bids what will take all.
2573	
2574	KENT	But who is with him?
2575	
2576	Gentleman	None but the fool; who labours to out-jest
2577	His heart-struck injuries.
2578	
2579	KENT	Sir, I do know you;
2580	And dare, upon the warrant of my note,
2581	Commend a dear thing to you. There is division,
2582	Although as yet the face of it be cover'd
2583	With mutual cunning, 'twixt Albany and Cornwall;
2584	Who have--as who have not, that their great stars
2585	Throned and set high?--servants, who seem no less,
2586	Which are to France the spies and speculations
2587	Intelligent of our state; what hath been seen,
2588	Either in snuffs and packings of the dukes,
2589	Or the hard rein which both of them have borne
2590	Against the old kind king; or something deeper,
2591	Whereof perchance these are but furnishings;
2592	But, true it is, from France there comes a power
2593	Into this scatter'd kingdom; who already,
2594	Wise in our negligence, have secret feet
2595	In some of our best ports, and are at point
2596	To show their open banner. Now to you:
2597	If on my credit you dare build so far
2598	To make your speed to Dover, you shall find
2599	Some that will thank you, making just report
2600	Of how unnatural and bemadding sorrow
2601	The king hath cause to plain.
2602	I am a gentleman of blood and breeding;
2603	And, from some knowledge and assurance, offer
2604	This office to you.
2605	
2606	Gentleman	I will talk further with you.
2607	
2608	KENT	No, do not.
2609	For confirmation that I am much more
2610	Than my out-wall, open this purse, and take
2611	What it contains. If you shall see Cordelia,--
2612	As fear not but you shall,--show her this ring;
2613	And she will tell you who your fellow is
2614	That yet you do not know. Fie on this storm!
2615	I will go seek the king.
2616	
2617	Gentleman	Give me your hand: have you no more to say?
2618	
2619	KENT	Few words, but, to effect, more than all yet;
2620	That, when we have found the king,--in which your pain
2621	That way, I'll this,--he that first lights on him
2622	Holla the other.
2623

2632	ACT III
2633	
2634	
2635	
2636	SCENE II	Another part of the heath. Storm still.
2637	
2638	
2639	[Enter KING LEAR and Fool]
2640	
2641	KING LEAR	Blow, winds, and crack your cheeks! rage! blow!
2642	You cataracts and hurricanoes, spout
2643	Till you have drench'd our steeples, drown'd the cocks!
2644	You sulphurous and thought-executing fires,
2645	Vaunt-couriers to oak-cleaving thunderbolts,
2646	Singe my white head! And thou, all-shaking thunder,
2647	Smite flat the thick rotundity o' the world!
2648	Crack nature's moulds, an germens spill at once,
2649	That make ingrateful man!
2650	
2651	Fool	O nuncle, court holy-water in a dry
2652	house is better than this rain-water out o' door.
2653	Good nuncle, in, and ask thy daughters' blessing:
2654	here's a night pities neither wise man nor fool.
2655	
2656	KING LEAR	Rumble thy bellyful! Spit, fire! spout, rain!
2657	Nor rain, wind, thunder, fire, are my daughters:
2658	I tax not you, you elements, with unkindness;
2659	I never gave you kingdom, call'd you children,
2660	You owe me no subscription: then let fall
2661	Your horrible pleasure: here I stand, your slave,
2662	A poor, infirm, weak, and despised old man:
2663	But yet I call you servile ministers,
2664	That have with two pernicious daughters join'd
2665	Your high engender'd battles 'gainst a head
2666	So old and white as this. O! O! 'tis foul!
2667	
2668	Fool	He that has a house to put's head in has a good
2669	head-piece.
2670	The cod-piece that will house
2671	Before the head has any,
2672	The head and he shall louse;
2673	So beggars marry many.
2674	The man that makes his toe
2675	What he his heart should make
2676	Shall of a corn cry woe,
2677	And turn his sleep to wake.
2678	For there was never yet fair woman but she made
2679	mouths in a glass.
2680	
2681	KING LEAR	No, I will be the pattern of all patience;
2682	I will say nothing.
2683	
2684	[Enter KENT]
2685	
2686	KENT	Who's there?
2687	
2688	Fool	Marry, here's grace and a cod-piece; that's a wise
2689	man and a fool.
2690	
2691	KENT	Alas, sir, are you here? things that love night
2692	Love not such nights as these; the wrathful skies
2693	Gallow the very wanderers of the dark,
2694	And make them keep their caves: since I was man,
2695	Such sheets of fire, such bursts of horrid thunder,
2696	Such groans of roaring wind and rain, I never
2697	Remember to have heard: man's nature cannot carry
2698	The affliction nor the fear.
2699	
2700	KING LEAR	Let the great gods,
2701	That keep this dreadful pother o'er our heads,
2702	Find out their enemies now. Tremble, thou wretch,
2703	That hast within thee undivulged crimes,
2704	Unwhipp'd of justice: hide thee, thou bloody hand;
2705	Thou perjured, and thou simular man of virtue
2706	That art incestuous: caitiff, to pieces shake,
2707	That under covert and convenient seeming
2708	Hast practised on man's life: close pent-up guilts,
2709	Rive your concealing continents, and cry
2710	These dreadful summoners grace. I am a man
2711	More sinn'd against than sinning.
2712	
2713	KENT	Alack, bare-headed!
2714	Gracious my lord, hard by here is a hovel;
2715	Some friendship will it lend you 'gainst the tempest:
2716	Repose you there; while I to this hard house--
2717	More harder than the stones whereof 'tis raised;
2718	Which even but now, demanding after you,
2719	Denied me to come in--return, and force
2720	Their scanted courtesy.

2722	KING LEAR	My wits begin to turn.
2723	Come on, my boy: how dost, my boy? art cold?
2724	I am cold myself. Where is this straw, my fellow?
2725	The art of our necessities is strange,
2726	That can make vile things precious. Come,
2727	your hovel.
2728	Poor fool and knave, I have one part in my heart
2729	That's sorry yet for thee.
2730	
2731	Fool	[Singing]
2732	
2733	He that has and a little tiny wit--
2734	With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,--
2735	Must make content with his fortunes fit,
2736	For the rain it raineth every day.
2737	
2738	KING LEAR	True, my good boy. Come, bring us to this hovel.
2739	
2740	[Exeunt KING LEAR and KENT]
2741	
2742	Fool	This is a brave night to cool a courtezan.
2743	I'll speak a prophecy ere I go:
2744	When priests are more in word than matter;
2745	When brewers mar their malt with water;
2746	When nobles are their tailors' tutors;
2747	No heretics burn'd, but wenches' suitors;
2748	When every case in law is right;
2749	No squire in debt, nor no poor knight;
2750	When slanders do not live in tongues;
2751	Nor cutpurses come not to throngs;
2752	When usurers tell their gold i' the field;
2753	And bawds and whores do churches build;
2754	Then shall the realm of Albion
2755	Come to great confusion:
2756	Then comes the time, who lives to see't,
2757	That going shall be used with feet.
2758	This prophecy Merlin shall make; for I live before his time.

2774	
2775	[Enter GLOUCESTER and EDMUND]
2776	
2777	GLOUCESTER	Alack, alack, Edmund, I like not this unnatural
2778	dealing. When I desire their leave that I might
2779	pity him, they took from me the use of mine own
2780	house; charged me, on pain of their perpetual
2781	displeasure, neither to speak of him, entreat for
2782	him, nor any way sustain him.
2783	
2784	EDMUND	Most savage and unnatural!
2785	
2786	GLOUCESTER	Go to; say you nothing. There's a division betwixt
2787	the dukes; and a worse matter than that: I have
2788	received a letter this night; 'tis dangerous to be
2789	spoken; I have locked the letter in my closet:
2790	these injuries the king now bears will be revenged
2791	home; there's part of a power already footed: we
2792	must incline to the king. I will seek him, and
2793	privily relieve him: go you and maintain talk with
2794	the duke, that my charity be not of him perceived:
2795	if he ask for me. I am ill, and gone to bed.
2796	Though I die for it, as no less is threatened me,
2797	the king my old master must be relieved. There is
2798	some strange thing toward, Edmund; pray you, be careful.
2799	
2800	[Exit]
2801	
2802	EDMUND	This courtesy, forbid thee, shall the duke
2803	Instantly know; and of that letter too:
2804	This seems a fair deserving, and must draw me
2805	That which my father loses; no less than all:
2806	The younger rises when the old doth fall.

2820	SCENE IV	The heath. Before a hovel.
2821	
2822	
2823	[Enter KING LEAR, KENT, and Fool]
2824	
2825	KENT	Here is the place, my lord; good my lord, enter:
2826	The tyranny of the open night's too rough
2827	For nature to endure.
2828	
2829	[Storm still]
2830	
2831	KING LEAR	Let me alone.
2832	
2833	KENT	Good my lord, enter here.
2834	
2835	KING LEAR	Wilt break my heart?
2836	
2837	KENT	I had rather break mine own. Good my lord, enter.
2838	
2839	KING LEAR	Thou think'st 'tis much that this contentious storm
2840	Invades us to the skin: so 'tis to thee;
2841	But where the greater malady is fix'd,
2842	The lesser is scarce felt. Thou'ldst shun a bear;
2843	But if thy flight lay toward the raging sea,
2844	Thou'ldst meet the bear i' the mouth. When the
2845	mind's free,
2846	The body's delicate: the tempest in my mind
2847	Doth from my senses take all feeling else
2848	Save what beats there. Filial ingratitude!
2849	Is it not as this mouth should tear this hand
2850	For lifting food to't? But I will punish home:
2851	No, I will weep no more. In such a night
2852	To shut me out! Pour on; I will endure.
2853	In such a night as this! O Regan, Goneril!
2854	Your old kind father, whose frank heart gave all,--
2855	O, that way madness lies; let me shun that;
2856	No more of that.
2857	
2858	KENT	                  Good my lord, enter here.
2859	
2860	KING LEAR	Prithee, go in thyself: seek thine own ease:
2861	This tempest will not give me leave to ponder
2862	On things would hurt me more. But I'll go in.
2863	
2864	[To the Fool]
2865	
2866	In, boy; go first. You houseless poverty,--
2867	Nay, get thee in. I'll pray, and then I'll sleep.
2868	
2869	[Fool goes in]
2870	
2871	Poor naked wretches, whereso'er you are,
2872	That bide the pelting of this pitiless storm,
2873	How shall your houseless heads and unfed sides,
2874	Your loop'd and window'd raggedness, defend you
2875	From seasons such as these? O, I have ta'en
2876	Too little care of this! Take physic, pomp;
2877	Expose thyself to feel what wretches feel,
2878	That thou mayst shake the superflux to them,
2879	And show the heavens more just.
2880	
2881	EDGAR	[Within]  Fathom and half, fathom and half! Poor Tom!
2882	
2883	[The Fool runs out from the hovel]
2884	
2885	Fool	Come not in here, nuncle, here's a spirit
2886	Help me, help me!
2887	
2888	KENT	Give me thy hand. Who's there?
2889	
2890	Fool	A spirit, a spirit: he says his name's poor Tom.
2891	
2892	KENT	What art thou that dost grumble there i' the straw?
2893	Come forth.
2894	
2895	[Enter EDGAR disguised as a mad man]
2896	
2897	EDGAR	Away! the foul fiend follows me!
2898	Through the sharp hawthorn blows the cold wind.
2899	Hum! go to thy cold bed, and warm thee.
2900	
2901	KING LEAR	Hast thou given all to thy two daughters?
2902	And art thou come to this?
2903	
2904	EDGAR	Who gives any thing to poor Tom? whom the foul
2905	fiend hath led through fire and through flame, and
2906	through ford and whirlipool e'er bog and quagmire;
2907	that hath laid knives under his pillow, and halters
2908	in his pew; set ratsbane by his porridge; made film
2909	proud of heart, to ride on a bay trotting-horse over
2910	four-inched bridges, to course his own shadow for a
2911	traitor. Bless thy five wits! Tom's a-cold,--O, do
2912	de, do de, do de. Bless thee from whirlwinds,
2913	star-blasting, and taking! Do poor Tom some
2914	charity, whom the foul fiend vexes: there could I
2915	have him now,--and there,--and there again, and there.
2916	
2917	[Storm still]
2918	
2919	KING LEAR	What, have his daughters brought him to this pass?
2920	Couldst thou save nothing? Didst thou give them all?
2921	
2922	Fool	Nay, he reserved a blanket, else we had been all shamed.
2923	
2924	KING LEAR	Now, all the plagues that in the pendulous air
2925	Hang fated o'er men's faults light on thy daughters!
2926	
2927	KENT	He hath no daughters, sir.
2928	
2929	KING LEAR	Death, traitor! nothing could have subdued nature
2930	To such a lowness but his unkind daughters.
2931	Is it the fashion, that discarded fathers
2932	Should have thus little mercy on their flesh?
2933	Judicious punishment! 'twas this flesh begot
2934	Those pelican daughters.
2935	
2936	EDGAR	Pillicock sat on Pillicock-hill:
2937	Halloo, halloo, loo, loo!
2938	
2939	Fool	This cold night will turn us all to fools and madmen.
2940	
2941	EDGAR	Take heed o' the foul fiend: obey thy parents;
2942	keep thy word justly; swear not; commit not with
2943	man's sworn spouse; set not thy sweet heart on proud
2944	array. Tom's a-cold.
2945	
2946	KING LEAR	What hast thou been?
2947	
2948	EDGAR	A serving-man, proud in heart and mind; that curled
2949	my hair; wore gloves in my cap; served the lust of
2950	my mistress' heart, and did the act of darkness with
2951	her; swore as many oaths as I spake words, and
2952	broke them in the sweet face of heaven: one that
2953	slept in the contriving of lust, and waked to do it:
2954	wine loved I deeply, dice dearly: and in woman
2955	out-paramoured the Turk: false of heart, light of
2956	ear, bloody of hand; hog in sloth, fox in stealth,
2957	wolf in greediness, dog in madness, lion in prey.
2958	Let not the creaking of shoes nor the rustling of
2959	silks betray thy poor heart to woman: keep thy foot
2960	out of brothels, thy hand out of plackets, thy pen
2961	from lenders' books, and defy the foul fiend.
2962	Still through the hawthorn blows the cold wind:
2963	Says suum, mun, ha, no, nonny.
2964	Dolphin my boy, my boy, sessa! let him trot by.
2965	
2966	[Storm still]
2967	
2968	KING LEAR	Why, thou wert better in thy grave than to answer
2969	with thy uncovered body this extremity of the skies.
2970	Is man no more than this? Consider him well. Thou
2971	owest the worm no silk, the beast no hide, the sheep
2972	no wool, the cat no perfume. Ha! here's three on
2973	's are sophisticated! Thou art the thing itself:
2974	unaccommodated man is no more but such a poor bare,
2975	forked animal as thou art. Off, off, you lendings!
2976	come unbutton here.
2977	
2978	[Tearing off his clothes]
2979	
2980	Fool	Prithee, nuncle, be contented; 'tis a naughty night
2981	to swim in. Now a little fire in a wild field were
2982	like an old lecher's heart; a small spark, all the
2983	rest on's body cold. Look, here comes a walking fire.
2984	
2985	[Enter GLOUCESTER, with a torch]
2986	
2987	EDGAR	This is the foul fiend Flibbertigibbet: he begins
2988	at curfew, and walks till the first cock; he gives
2989	the web and the pin, squints the eye, and makes the
2990	hare-lip; mildews the white wheat, and hurts the
2991	poor creature of earth.
2992	S. Withold footed thrice the old;
2993	He met the night-mare, and her nine-fold;
2994	Bid her alight,
2995	And her troth plight,
2996	And, aroint thee, witch, aroint thee!
2997	
2998	KENT	How fares your grace?
2999	
3000	KING LEAR	What's he?
3001	
3002	KENT	Who's there? What is't you seek?
3003	
3004	GLOUCESTER	What are you there? Your names?
3005	
3006	EDGAR	Poor Tom; that eats the swimming frog, the toad,
3007	the tadpole, the wall-newt and the water; that in
3008	the fury of his heart, when the foul fiend rages,
3009	eats cow-dung for sallets; swallows the old rat and
3010	the ditch-dog; drinks the green mantle of the
3011	standing pool; who is whipped from tithing to
3012	tithing, and stock- punished, and imprisoned; who
3013	hath had three suits to his back, six shirts to his
3014	body, horse to ride, and weapon to wear;
3015	But mice and rats, and such small deer,
3016	Have been Tom's food for seven long year.
3017	Beware my follower. Peace, Smulkin; peace, thou fiend!
3018	
3019	GLOUCESTER	What, hath your grace no better company?
3020	
3021	EDGAR	The prince of darkness is a gentleman:
3022	Modo he's call'd, and Mahu.
3023	
3024	GLOUCESTER	Our flesh and blood is grown so vile, my lord,
3025	That it doth hate what gets it.
3026	
3027	EDGAR	Poor Tom's a-cold.
3028	
3029	GLOUCESTER	Go in with me: my duty cannot suffer
3030	To obey in all your daughters' hard commands:
3031	Though their injunction be to bar my doors,
3032	And let this tyrannous night take hold upon you,
3033	Yet have I ventured to come seek you out,
3034	And bring you where both fire and food is ready.
3035	
3036	KING LEAR	First let me talk with this philosopher.
3037	What is the cause of thunder?
3038	
3039	KENT	Good my lord, take his offer; go into the house.
3040	
3041	KING LEAR	I'll talk a word with this same learned Theban.
3042	What is your study?
3043	
3044	EDGAR	How to prevent the fiend, and to kill vermin.
3045	
3046	KING LEAR	Let me ask you one word in private.
3047	
3048	KENT	Importune him once more to go, my lord;
3049	His wits begin to unsettle.
3050	
3051	GLOUCESTER	Canst thou blame him?
3052	
3053	[Storm still]
3054	
3055	His daughters seek his death: ah, that good Kent!
3056	He said it would be thus, poor banish'd man!
3057	Thou say'st the king grows mad; I'll tell thee, friend,
3058	I am almost mad myself: I had a son,
3059	Now outlaw'd from my blood; he sought my life,
3060	But lately, very late: I loved him, friend;
3061	No father his son dearer: truth to tell thee,
3062	The grief hath crazed my wits. What a night's this!
3063	I do beseech your grace,--
3064	
3065	KING LEAR	O, cry your mercy, sir.
3066	Noble philosopher, your company.
3067	
3068	EDGAR	Tom's a-cold.
3069	
3070	GLOUCESTER	In, fellow, there, into the hovel: keep thee warm.
3071	
3072	KING LEAR	Come let's in all.
3073	
3074	KENT	                  This way, my lord.
3075	
3076	KING LEAR	With him;
3077	I will keep still with my philosopher.
3078	
3079	KENT	Good my lord, soothe him; let him take the fellow.
3080	
3081	GLOUCESTER	Take him you on.
3082	
3083	KENT	Sirrah, come on; go along with us.
3084	
3085	KING LEAR	Come, good Athenian.
3086	
3087	GLOUCESTER	No words, no words: hush.
3088	
3089	EDGAR	      Child Rowland to the dark tower came,
3090	His word was still,--Fie, foh, and fum,
3091	I smell the blood of a British man.

3109	
3110	CORNWALL	I will have my revenge ere I depart his house.
3111	
3112	EDMUND	How, my lord, I may be censured, that nature thus
3113	gives way to loyalty, something fears me to think
3114	of.
3115	
3116	CORNWALL	I now perceive, it was not altogether your
3117	brother's evil disposition made him seek his death;
3118	but a provoking merit, set a-work by a reprovable
3119	badness in himself.
3120	
3121	EDMUND	How malicious is my fortune, that I must repent to
3122	be just! This is the letter he spoke of, which
3123	approves him an intelligent party to the advantages
3124	of France: O heavens! that this treason were not,
3125	or not I the detector!
3126	
3127	CORNWALL	o with me to the duchess.
3128	
3129	EDMUND	If the matter of this paper be certain, you have
3130	mighty business in hand.
3131	
3132	CORNWALL	True or false, it hath made thee earl of
3133	Gloucester. Seek out where thy father is, that he
3134	may be ready for our apprehension.
3135	
3136	EDMUND	[Aside]  If I find him comforting the king, it will
3137	stuff his suspicion more fully.--I will persevere in
3138	my course of loyalty, though the conflict be sore
3139	between that and my blood.
3140

3161	GLOUCESTER	Here is better than the open air; take it
3162	thankfully. I will piece out the comfort with what
3163	addition I can: I will not be long from you.
3164

3171	Nero is an angler in the lake of darkness.
3172	Pray, innocent, and beware the foul fiend.
3173	
3174	Fool	Prithee, nuncle, tell me whether a madman be a
3175	gentleman or a yeoman?
3176	
3177	KING LEAR	A king, a king!
3178	
3179	Fool	No, he's a yeoman that has a gentleman to his son;
3180	for he's a mad yeoman that sees his son a gentleman
3181	before him.
3182	
3183	KING LEAR	To have a thousand with red burning spits
3184	Come hissing in upon 'em,--
3185	
3186	EDGAR	The foul fiend bites my back.
3187	
3188	Fool	He's mad that trusts in the tameness of a wolf, a
3189	horse's health, a boy's love, or a whore's oath.
3190	
3191	KING LEAR	It shall be done; I will arraign them straight.
3192

3199	Thou, sapient sir, sit here. Now, you she foxes!
3200	
3201	EDGAR	   Look, where he stands and glares!
3202	Wantest thou eyes at trial, madam?
3203	Come o'er the bourn, Bessy, to me,--
3204	
3205	Fool	   Her boat hath a leak,
3206	And she must not speak
3207	Why she dares not come over to thee.
3208	
3209	EDGAR	The foul fiend haunts poor Tom in the voice of a
3210	nightingale. Hopdance cries in Tom's belly for two
3211	white herring. Croak not, black angel; I have no
3212	food for thee.
3213	
3214	KENT	How do you, sir? Stand you not so amazed:
3215	Will you lie down and rest upon the cushions?
3216	
3217	KING LEAR	I'll see their trial first. Bring in the evidence.
3218

3220	
3221	Thou robed man of justice, take thy place;

3226	Bench by his side:
3227	
3228	[To KENT]
3229	
3230	you are o' the commission,
3231	Sit you too.
3232	
3233	EDGAR	Let us deal justly.
3234	Sleepest or wakest thou, jolly shepherd?
3235	Thy sheep be in the corn;
3236	And for one blast of thy minikin mouth,
3237	Thy sheep shall take no harm.
3238	Pur! the cat is gray.
3239	
3240	KING LEAR	Arraign her first; 'tis Goneril. I here take my
3241	oath before this honourable assembly, she kicked the
3242	poor king her father.
3243	
3244	Fool	Come hither, mistress. Is your name Goneril?

3246	KING LEAR	She cannot deny it.
3247

3249

3251	What store her heart is made on. Stop her there!
3252	Arms, arms, sword, fire! Corruption in the place!
3253	False justicer, why hast thou let her 'scape?
3254	
3255	EDGAR	Bless thy five wits!
3256	
3257	KENT	O pity! Sir, where is the patience now,
3258	That thou so oft have boasted to retain?
3259	
3260	EDGAR	[Aside]  My tears begin to take his part so much,
3261	They'll mar my counterfeiting.
3262	
3263	KING LEAR	The little dogs and all, Tray, Blanch, and
3264	Sweet-heart, see, they bark at me.
3265	
3266	EDGAR	Tom will throw his head at them. Avaunt, you curs!
3267	Be thy mouth or black or white,
3268	Tooth that poisons if it bite;
3269	Mastiff, grey-hound, mongrel grim,
3270	Hound or spaniel, brach or lym,
3271	Or bobtail tike or trundle-tail,
3272	Tom will make them weep and wail:
3273	For, with throwing thus my head,
3274	Dogs leap the hatch, and all are fled.
3275	Do de, de, de. Sessa! Come, march to wakes and
3276	fairs and market-towns. Poor Tom, thy horn is dry.
3277	
3278	KING LEAR	Then let them anatomize Regan; see what breeds
3279	about her heart. Is there any cause in nature that
3280	makes these hard hearts?
3281	
3282	[To EDGAR]
3283	
3284	You, sir, I entertain for one of my hundred; only I
3285	do not like the fashion of your garments: you will
3286	say they are Persian attire: but let them be changed.
3287	
3288	KENT	Now, good my lord, lie here and rest awhile.
3289	
3290	KING LEAR	Make no noise, make no noise; draw the curtains:
3291	so, so, so. We'll go to supper i' he morning. So, so, so.
3292	
3293	Fool	And I'll go to bed at noon.
3294	
3295	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]
3296	
3297	GLOUCESTER	Come hither, friend: where is the king my master?
3298	
3299	KENT	Here, sir; but trouble him not, his wits are gone.
3300	
3301	GLOUCESTER	Good friend, I prithee, take him in thy arms;
3302	I have o'erheard a plot of death upon him:
3303	There is a litter ready; lay him in 't,
3304	And drive towards Dover, friend, where thou shalt meet
3305	Both welcome and protection. Take up thy master:
3306	If thou shouldst dally half an hour, his life,
3307	With thine, and all that offer to defend him,
3308	Stand in assured loss: take up, take up;
3309	And follow me, that will to some provision
3310	Give thee quick conduct.
3311	
3312	KENT	Oppressed nature sleeps:
3313	This rest might yet have balm'd thy broken senses,
3314	Which, if convenience will not allow,
3315	Stand in hard cure.
3316	
3317	[To the Fool]
3318	
3319	Come, help to bear thy master;
3320	Thou must not stay behind.
3321	
3322	GLOUCESTER	Come, come, away.
3323	
3324	[Exeunt all but EDGAR]
3325	
3326	EDGAR	When we our betters see bearing our woes,
3327	We scarcely think our miseries our foes.
3328	Who alone suffers suffers most i' the mind,
3329	Leaving free things and happy shows behind:
3330	But then the mind much sufferance doth o'er skip,
3331	When grief hath mates, and bearing fellowship.
3332	How light and portable my pain seems now,
3333	When that which makes me bend makes the king bow,
3334	He childed as I father'd! Tom, away!
3335	Mark the high noises; and thyself bewray,
3336	When false opinion, whose wrong thought defiles thee,
3337	In thy just proof, repeals and reconciles thee.
3338	What will hap more to-night, safe 'scape the king!
3339	Lurk, lurk.

3351	
3352	
3353	SCENE VII	Gloucester's castle.
3354	
3355	
3356	[Enter CORNWALL, REGAN, GONERIL, EDMUND, and Servants]
3357	
3358	CORNWALL	Post speedily to my lord your husband; show him
3359	this letter: the army of France is landed. Seek
3360	out the villain Gloucester.
3361	
3362	[Exeunt some of the Servants]
3363	
3364	REGAN	Hang him instantly.
3365	
3366	GONERIL	Pluck out his eyes.
3367	
3368	CORNWALL	Leave him to my displeasure. Edmund, keep you our
3369	sister company: the revenges we are bound to take
3370	upon your traitorous father are not fit for your
3371	beholding. Advise the duke, where you are going, to
3372	a most festinate preparation: we are bound to the
3373	like. Our posts shall be swift and intelligent
3374	betwixt us. Farewell, dear sister: farewell, my
3375	lord of Gloucester.
3376	
3377	[Enter OSWALD]
3378	
3379	How now! where's the king?
3380	
3381	OSWALD	My lord of Gloucester hath convey'd him hence:
3382	Some five or six and thirty of his knights,
3383	Hot questrists after him, met him at gate;
3384	Who, with some other of the lords dependants,
3385	Are gone with him towards Dover; where they boast
3386	To have well-armed friends.
3387	
3388	CORNWALL	Get horses for your mistress.
3389	
3390	GONERIL	Farewell, sweet lord, and sister.
3391	
3392	CORNWALL	Edmund, farewell.
3393	
3394	[Exeunt GONERIL, EDMUND, and OSWALD]
3395	
3396	Go seek the traitor Gloucester,
3397	Pinion him like a thief, bring him before us.
3398	
3399	[Exeunt other Servants]
3400	
3401	Though well we may not pass upon his life
3402	Without the form of justice, yet our power
3403	Shall do a courtesy to our wrath, which men
3404	May blame, but not control. Who's there? the traitor?
3405	
3406	[Enter GLOUCESTER, brought in by two or three]
3407	
3408	REGAN	Ingrateful fox! 'tis he.
3409	
3410	CORNWALL	Bind fast his corky arms.
3411	
3412	GLOUCESTER	What mean your graces? Good my friends, consider
3413	You are my guests: do me no foul play, friends.
3414	
3415	CORNWALL	Bind him, I say.
3416	
3417	[Servants bind him]
3418	
3419	REGAN	                  Hard, hard. O filthy traitor!
3420	
3421	GLOUCESTER	Unmerciful lady as you are, I'm none.
3422	
3423	CORNWALL	To this chair bind him. Villain, thou shalt find--
3424	
3425	[REGAN plucks his beard]
3426	
3427	GLOUCESTER	By the kind gods, 'tis most ignobly done
3428	To pluck me by the beard.
3429	
3430	REGAN	So white, and such a traitor!
3431	
3432	GLOUCESTER	Naughty lady,
3433	These hairs, which thou dost ravish from my chin,
3434	Will quicken, and accuse thee: I am your host:
3435	With robbers' hands my hospitable favours
3436	You should not ruffle thus. What will you do?
3437	
3438	CORNWALL	Come, sir, what letters had you late from France?
3439	
3440	REGAN	Be simple answerer, for we know the truth.
3441	
3442	CORNWALL	And what confederacy have you with the traitors
3443	Late footed in the kingdom?
3444	
3445	REGAN	To whose hands have you sent the lunatic king? Speak.
3446	
3447	GLOUCESTER	I have a letter guessingly set down,
3448	Which came from one that's of a neutral heart,
3449	And not from one opposed.
3450	
3451	CORNWALL	Cunning.
3452	
3453	REGAN	And false.
3454	
3455	CORNWALL	Where hast thou sent the king?
3456	
3457	GLOUCESTER	To Dover.
3458	
3459	REGAN	Wherefore to Dover? Wast thou not charged at peril--
3460	
3461	CORNWALL	Wherefore to Dover? Let him first answer that.
3462	
3463	GLOUCESTER	I am tied to the stake, and I must stand the course.
3464	
3465	REGAN	Wherefore to Dover, sir?
3466	
3467	GLOUCESTER	Because I would not see thy cruel nails
3468	Pluck out his poor old eyes; nor thy fierce sister
3469	In his anointed flesh stick boarish fangs.
3470	The sea, with such a storm as his bare head
3471	In hell-black night endured, would have buoy'd up,
3472	And quench'd the stelled fires:
3473	Yet, poor old heart, he holp the heavens to rain.
3474	If wolves had at thy gate howl'd that stern time,
3475	Thou shouldst have said 'Good porter, turn the key,'
3476	All cruels else subscribed: but I shall see
3477	The winged vengeance overtake such children.
3478	
3479	CORNWALL	See't shalt thou never. Fellows, hold the chair.
3480	Upon these eyes of thine I'll set my foot.
3481	
3482	GLOUCESTER	He that will think to live till he be old,
3483	Give me some help! O cruel! O you gods!
3484	
3485	REGAN	One side will mock another; the other too.
3486	
3487	CORNWALL	If you see vengeance,--
3488	
3489	First Servant	Hold your hand, my lord:
3490	I have served you ever since I was a child;
3491	But better service have I never done you
3492	Than now to bid you hold.
3493	
3494	REGAN	How now, you dog!
3495	
3496	First Servant	If you did wear a beard upon your chin,
3497	I'd shake it on this quarrel. What do you mean?
3498	
3499	CORNWALL	My villain!
3500	
3501	[They draw and fight]
3502	
3503	First Servant	Nay, then, come on, and take the chance of anger.
3504	
3505	REGAN	Give me thy sword. A peasant stand up thus!
3506	
3507	[Takes a sword, and runs at him behind]
3508	
3509	First Servant	O, I am slain! My lord, you have one eye left
3510	To see some mischief on him. O!
3511	
3512	[Dies]
3513	
3514	CORNWALL	Lest it see more, prevent it. Out, vile jelly!
3515	Where is thy lustre now?
3516	
3517	GLOUCESTER	All dark and comfortless. Where's my son Edmund?
3518	Edmund, enkindle all the sparks of nature,
3519	To quit this horrid act.
3520	
3521	REGAN	Out, treacherous villain!
3522	Thou call'st on him that hates thee: it was he
3523	That made the overture of thy treasons to us;
3524	Who is too good to pity thee.
3525	
3526	GLOUCESTER	O my follies! then Edgar was abused.
3527	Kind gods, forgive me that, and prosper him!
3528	
3529	REGAN	Go thrust him out at gates, and let him smell
3530	His way to Dover.
3531	
3532	[Exit one with GLOUCESTER]
3533	
3534	How is't, my lord? how look you?
3535	
3536	CORNWALL	I have received a hurt: follow me, lady.
3537	Turn out that eyeless villain; throw this slave
3538	Upon the dunghill. Regan, I bleed apace:
3539	Untimely comes this hurt: give me your arm.
3540	
3541	[Exit CORNWALL, led by REGAN]
3542	
3543	Second Servant	I'll never care what wickedness I do,
3544	If this man come to good.
3545	
3546	Third Servant	If she live long,
3547	And in the end meet the old course of death,
3548	Women will all turn monsters.
3549	
3550	Second Servant	Let's follow the old earl, and get the Bedlam
3551	To lead him where he would: his roguish madness
3552	Allows itself to any thing.
3553	
3554	Third Servant	Go thou: I'll fetch some flax and whites of eggs
3555	To apply to his bleeding face. Now, heaven help him!

3569	SCENE I	The heath.
3570	
3571	
3572	[Enter EDGAR]
3573	
3574	EDGAR	Yet better thus, and known to be contemn'd,
3575	Than still contemn'd and flatter'd. To be worst,
3576	The lowest and most dejected thing of fortune,
3577	Stands still in esperance, lives not in fear:
3578	The lamentable change is from the best;
3579	The worst returns to laughter. Welcome, then,
3580	Thou unsubstantial air that I embrace!
3581	The wretch that thou hast blown unto the worst
3582	Owes nothing to thy blasts. But who comes here?
3583	
3584	[Enter GLOUCESTER, led by an Old Man]
3585	
3586	My father, poorly led? World, world, O world!
3587	But that thy strange mutations make us hate thee,
3588	Lie would not yield to age.
3589	
3590	Old Man	O, my good lord, I have been your tenant, and
3591	your father's tenant, these fourscore years.
3592	
3593	GLOUCESTER	Away, get thee away; good friend, be gone:
3594	Thy comforts can do me no good at all;
3595	Thee they may hurt.
3596	
3597	Old Man	Alack, sir, you cannot see your way.
3598	
3599	GLOUCESTER	I have no way, and therefore want no eyes;
3600	I stumbled when I saw: full oft 'tis seen,
3601	Our means secure us, and our mere defects
3602	Prove our commodities. O dear son Edgar,
3603	The food of thy abused father's wrath!
3604	Might I but live to see thee in my touch,
3605	I'ld say I had eyes again!
3606	
3607	Old Man	How now! Who's there?
3608	
3609	EDGAR	[Aside]  O gods! Who is't can say 'I am at
3610	the worst'?
3611	I am worse than e'er I was.
3612	
3613	Old Man	'Tis poor mad Tom.
3614	
3615	EDGAR	[Aside]  And worse I may be yet: the worst is not
3616	So long as we can say  'This is the worst.'
3617	
3618	Old Man	Fellow, where goest?
3619	
3620	GLOUCESTER	Is it a beggar-man?
3621	
3622	Old Man	Madman and beggar too.
3623	
3624	GLOUCESTER	He has some reason, else he could not beg.
3625	I' the last night's storm I such a fellow saw;
3626	Which made me think a man a worm: my son
3627	Came then into my mind; and yet my mind
3628	Was then scarce friends with him: I have heard
3629	more since.
3630	As flies to wanton boys, are we to the gods.
3631	They kill us for their sport.
3632	
3633	EDGAR	[Aside]	How should this be?
3634	Bad is the trade that must play fool to sorrow,
3635	Angering itself and others.--Bless thee, master!
3636	
3637	GLOUCESTER	Is that the naked fellow?
3638	
3639	Old Man	Ay, my lord.
3640	
3641	GLOUCESTER	Then, prithee, get thee gone: if, for my sake,
3642	Thou wilt o'ertake us, hence a mile or twain,
3643	I' the way toward Dover, do it for ancient love;
3644	And bring some covering for this naked soul,
3645	Who I'll entreat to lead me.
3646	
3647	Old Man	Alack, sir, he is mad.
3648	
3649	GLOUCESTER	'Tis the times' plague, when madmen lead the blind.
3650	Do as I bid thee, or rather do thy pleasure;
3651	Above the rest, be gone.
3652	
3653	Old Man	I'll bring him the best 'parel that I have,
3654	Come on't what will.
3655	
3656	[Exit]
3657	
3658	GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, naked fellow,--
3659	
3660	EDGAR	Poor Tom's a-cold.
3661	
3662	[Aside]
3663	
3664	I cannot daub it further.
3665	
3666	GLOUCESTER	Come hither, fellow.
3667	
3668	EDGAR	[Aside]  And yet I must.--Bless thy sweet eyes, they bleed.
3669	
3670	GLOUCESTER	Know'st thou the way to Dover?
3671	
3672	EDGAR	Both stile and gate, horse-way and foot-path. Poor
3673	Tom hath been scared out of his good wits: bless
3674	thee, good man's son, from the foul fiend! five
3675	fiends have been in poor Tom at once; of lust, as
3676	Obidicut; Hobbididence, prince of dumbness; Mahu, of
3677	stealing; Modo, of murder; Flibbertigibbet, of
3678	mopping and mowing, who since possesses chambermaids
3679	and waiting-women. So, bless thee, master!
3680	
3681	GLOUCESTER	Here, take this purse, thou whom the heavens' plagues
3682	Have humbled to all strokes: that I am wretched
3683	Makes thee the happier: heavens, deal so still!
3684	Let the superfluous and lust-dieted man,
3685	That slaves your ordinance, that will not see
3686	Because he doth not feel, feel your power quickly;
3687	So distribution should undo excess,
3688	And each man have enough. Dost thou know Dover?
3689	
3690	EDGAR	Ay, master.
3691	
3692	GLOUCESTER	There is a cliff, whose high and bending head
3693	Looks fearfully in the confined deep:
3694	Bring me but to the very brim of it,
3695	And I'll repair the misery thou dost bear
3696	With something rich about me: from that place
3697	I shall no leading need.
3698	
3699	EDGAR	Give me thy arm:
3700	Poor Tom shall lead thee.

3714	SCENE II	Before ALBANY's palace.
3715	
3716	
3717	[Enter GONERIL and EDMUND]
3718	
3719	GONERIL	Welcome, my lord: I marvel our mild husband
3720	Not met us on the way.
3721	
3722	[Enter OSWALD]
3723	
3724	Now, where's your master'?
3725	
3726	OSWALD	Madam, within; but never man so changed.
3727	I told him of the army that was landed;
3728	He smiled at it: I told him you were coming:
3729	His answer was 'The worse:' of Gloucester's treachery,
3730	And of the loyal service of his son,
3731	When I inform'd him, then he call'd me sot,
3732	And told me I had turn'd the wrong side out:
3733	What most he should dislike seems pleasant to him;
3734	What like, offensive.
3735	
3736	GONERIL	[To EDMUND]  Then shall you go no further.
3737	It is the cowish terror of his spirit,
3738	That dares not undertake: he'll not feel wrongs
3739	Which tie him to an answer. Our wishes on the way
3740	May prove effects. Back, Edmund, to my brother;
3741	Hasten his musters and conduct his powers:
3742	I must change arms at home, and give the distaff
3743	Into my husband's hands. This trusty servant
3744	Shall pass between us: ere long you are like to hear,
3745	If you dare venture in your own behalf,
3746	A mistress's command. Wear this; spare speech;
3747	
3748	[Giving a favour]
3749	
3750	Decline your head: this kiss, if it durst speak,
3751	Would stretch thy spirits up into the air:
3752	Conceive, and fare thee well.
3753	
3754	EDMUND	Yours in the ranks of death.
3755	
3756	GONERIL	My most dear Gloucester!
3757	
3758	[Exit EDMUND]
3759	
3760	O, the difference of man and man!
3761	To thee a woman's services are due:
3762	My fool usurps my body.
3763	
3764	OSWALD	Madam, here comes my lord.
3765	
3766	[Exit]
3767	
3768	[Enter ALBANY]
3769	
3770	GONERIL	I have been worth the whistle.
3771	
3772	ALBANY	O Goneril!
3773	You are not worth the dust which the rude wind
3774	Blows in your face. I fear your disposition:
3775	That nature, which contemns its origin,
3776	Cannot be border'd certain in itself;
3777	She that herself will sliver and disbranch
3778	From her material sap, perforce must wither
3779	And come to deadly use.
3780	
3781	GONERIL	No more; the text is foolish.
3782	
3783	ALBANY	Wisdom and goodness to the vile seem vile:
3784	Filths savour but themselves. What have you done?
3785	Tigers, not daughters, what have you perform'd?
3786	A father, and a gracious aged man,
3787	Whose reverence even the head-lugg'd bear would lick,
3788	Most barbarous, most degenerate! have you madded.
3789	Could my good brother suffer you to do it?
3790	A man, a prince, by him so benefited!
3791	If that the heavens do not their visible spirits
3792	Send quickly down to tame these vile offences,
3793	It will come,
3794	Humanity must perforce prey on itself,
3795	Like monsters of the deep.
3796	
3797	GONERIL	Milk-liver'd man!
3798	That bear'st a cheek for blows, a head for wrongs;
3799	Who hast not in thy brows an eye discerning
3800	Thine honour from thy suffering; that not know'st
3801	Fools do those villains pity who are punish'd
3802	Ere they have done their mischief. Where's thy drum?
3803	France spreads his banners in our noiseless land;
3804	With plumed helm thy slayer begins threats;
3805	Whiles thou, a moral fool, sit'st still, and criest
3806	'Alack, why does he so?'
3807	
3808	ALBANY	See thyself, devil!
3809	Proper deformity seems not in the fiend
3810	So horrid as in woman.
3811	
3812	GONERIL	O vain fool!
3813	
3814	ALBANY	Thou changed and self-cover'd thing, for shame,
3815	Be-monster not thy feature. Were't my fitness
3816	To let these hands obey my blood,
3817	They are apt enough to dislocate and tear
3818	Thy flesh and bones: howe'er thou art a fiend,
3819	A woman's shape doth shield thee.
3820	
3821	GONERIL	Marry, your manhood now--
3822	
3823	[Enter a Messenger]
3824	
3825	ALBANY	What news?
3826	
3827	Messenger	O, my good lord, the Duke of Cornwall's dead:
3828	Slain by his servant, going to put out
3829	The other eye of Gloucester.
3830	
3831	ALBANY	Gloucester's eye!
3832	
3833	Messenger	A servant that he bred, thrill'd with remorse,
3834	Opposed against the act, bending his sword
3835	To his great master; who, thereat enraged,
3836	Flew on him, and amongst them fell'd him dead;
3837	But not without that harmful stroke, which since
3838	Hath pluck'd him after.
3839	
3840	ALBANY	This shows you are above,
3841	You justicers, that these our nether crimes
3842	So speedily can venge! But, O poor Gloucester!
3843	Lost he his other eye?
3844	
3845	Messenger	Both, both, my lord.
3846	This letter, madam, craves a speedy answer;
3847	'Tis from your sister.
3848	
3849	GONERIL	[Aside]              One way I like this well;
3850	But being widow, and my Gloucester with her,
3851	May all the building in my fancy pluck
3852	Upon my hateful life: another way,
3853	The news is not so tart.--I'll read, and answer.
3854	
3855	[Exit]
3856	
3857	ALBANY	Where was his son when they did take his eyes?
3858	
3859	Messenger	Come with my lady hither.
3860	
3861	ALBANY	He is not here.
3862	
3863	Messenger	No, my good lord; I met him back again.
3864	
3865	ALBANY	Knows he the wickedness?
3866	
3867	Messenger	Ay, my good lord; 'twas he inform'd against him;
3868	And quit the house on purpose, that their punishment
3869	Might have the freer course.
3870	
3871	ALBANY	Gloucester, I live
3872	To thank thee for the love thou show'dst the king,
3873	And to revenge thine eyes. Come hither, friend:
3874	Tell me what more thou know'st.

3884	ACT IV
3885	
3886	
3887	
3888	SCENE III	The French camp near Dover.
3889	
3890	
3891	[Enter KENT and a Gentleman]
3892	
3893	KENT	Why the King of France is so suddenly gone back
3894	know you the reason?
3895	
3896	Gentleman	Something he left imperfect in the
3897	state, which since his coming forth is thought
3898	of; which imports to the kingdom so much
3899	fear and danger, that his personal return was
3900	most required and necessary.
3901	
3902	KENT	Who hath he left behind him general?
3903	
3904	Gentleman	The Marshal of France, Monsieur La Far.
3905	
3906	KENT	Did your letters pierce the queen to any
3907	demonstration of grief?
3908	
3909	Gentleman	Ay, sir; she took them, read them in my presence;
3910	And now and then an ample tear trill'd down
3911	Her delicate cheek: it seem'd she was a queen
3912	Over her passion; who, most rebel-like,
3913	Sought to be king o'er her.
3914	
3915	KENT	O, then it moved her.
3916	
3917	Gentleman	Not to a rage: patience and sorrow strove
3918	Who should express her goodliest. You have seen
3919	Sunshine and rain at once: her smiles and tears
3920	Were like a better way: those happy smilets,
3921	That play'd on her ripe lip, seem'd not to know
3922	What guests were in her eyes; which parted thence,
3923	As pearls from diamonds dropp'd. In brief,
3924	Sorrow would be a rarity most beloved,
3925	If all could so become it.
3926	
3927	KENT	Made she no verbal question?
3928	
3929	Gentleman	'Faith, once or twice she heaved the name of 'father'
3930	Pantingly forth, as if it press'd her heart:
3931	Cried 'Sisters! sisters! Shame of ladies! sisters!
3932	Kent! father! sisters! What, i' the storm? i' the night?
3933	Let pity not be believed!' There she shook
3934	The holy water from her heavenly eyes,
3935	And clamour moisten'd: then away she started
3936	To deal with grief alone.
3937	
3938	KENT	It is the stars,
3939	The stars above us, govern our conditions;
3940	Else one self mate and mate could not beget
3941	Such different issues. You spoke not with her since?
3942	
3943	Gentleman	No.
3944	
3945	KENT	Was this before the king return'd?
3946	
3947	Gentleman	No, since.
3948	
3949	KENT	Well, sir, the poor distressed Lear's i' the town;
3950	Who sometime, in his better tune, remembers
3951	What we are come about, and by no means
3952	Will yield to see his daughter.
3953	
3954	Gentleman	Why, good sir?
3955	
3956	KENT	A sovereign shame so elbows him: his own unkindness,
3957	That stripp'd her from his benediction, turn'd her
3958	To foreign casualties, gave her dear rights
3959	To his dog-hearted daughters, these things sting
3960	His mind so venomously, that burning shame
3961	Detains him from Cordelia.
3962	
3963	Gentleman	Alack, poor gentleman!
3964	
3965	KENT	Of Albany's and Cornwall's powers you heard not?
3966	
3967	Gentleman	'Tis so, they are afoot.
3968	
3969	KENT	Well, sir, I'll bring you to our master Lear,
3970	And leave you to attend him: some dear cause
3971	Will in concealment wrap me up awhile;
3972	When I am known aright, you shall not grieve
3973	Lending me this acquaintance. I pray you, go
3974	Along with me.

3990	[Enter, with drum and colours, CORDELIA, Doctor, and Soldiers]
3991	
3992	CORDELIA	Alack, 'tis he: why, he was met even now
3993	As mad as the vex'd sea; singing aloud;
3994	Crown'd with rank fumiter and furrow-weeds,
3995	With bur-docks, hemlock, nettles, cuckoo-flowers,
3996	Darnel, and all the idle weeds that grow
3997	In our sustaining corn. A century send forth;
3998	Search every acre in the high-grown field,
3999	And bring him to our eye.
4000	
4001	[Exit an Officer]
4002	
4003	What can man's wisdom
4004	In the restoring his bereaved sense?
4005	He that helps him take all my outward worth.
4006	
4007	Doctor	There is means, madam:
4008	Our foster-nurse of nature is repose,
4009	The which he lacks; that to provoke in him,
4010	Are many simples operative, whose power
4011	Will close the eye of anguish.
4012	
4013	CORDELIA	All blest secrets,
4014	All you unpublish'd virtues of the earth,
4015	Spring with my tears! be aidant and remediate
4016	In the good man's distress! Seek, seek for him;
4017	Lest his ungovern'd rage dissolve the life
4018	That wants the means to lead it.
4019	
4020	[Enter a Messenger]
4021	
4022	Messenger	News, madam;
4023	The British powers are marching hitherward.
4024	
4025	CORDELIA	'Tis known before; our preparation stands
4026	In expectation of them. O dear father,
4027	It is thy business that I go about;
4028	Therefore great France
4029	My mourning and important tears hath pitied.
4030	No blown ambition doth our arms incite,
4031	But love, dear love, and our aged father's right:
4032	Soon may I hear and see him!

4047	
4048	
4049	[Enter REGAN and OSWALD]
4050	
4051	REGAN	But are my brother's powers set forth?
4052	
4053	OSWALD	Ay, madam.
4054	
4055	REGAN	Himself in person there?
4056	
4057	OSWALD	Madam, with much ado:
4058	Your sister is the better soldier.
4059	
4060	REGAN	Lord Edmund spake not with your lord at home?
4061	
4062	OSWALD	No, madam.
4063	
4064	REGAN	What might import my sister's letter to him?
4065	
4066	OSWALD	I know not, lady.
4067	
4068	REGAN	'Faith, he is posted hence on serious matter.
4069	It was great ignorance, Gloucester's eyes being out,
4070	To let him live: where he arrives he moves
4071	All hearts against us: Edmund, I think, is gone,
4072	In pity of his misery, to dispatch
4073	His nighted life: moreover, to descry
4074	The strength o' the enemy.
4075	
4076	OSWALD	I must needs after him, madam, with my letter.
4077	
4078	REGAN	Our troops set forth to-morrow: stay with us;
4079	The ways are dangerous.
4080	
4081	OSWALD	I may not, madam:
4082	My lady charged my duty in this business.
4083	
4084	REGAN	Why should she write to Edmund? Might not you
4085	Transport her purposes by word? Belike,
4086	Something--I know not what: I'll love thee much,
4087	Let me unseal the letter.
4088	
4089	OSWALD	Madam, I had rather--
4090	
4091	REGAN	I know your lady does not love her husband;
4092	I am sure of that: and at her late being here
4093	She gave strange oeillades and most speaking looks
4094	To noble Edmund. I know you are of her bosom.
4095	
4096	OSWALD	I, madam?
4097	
4098	REGAN	I speak in understanding; you are; I know't:
4099	Therefore I do advise you, take this note:
4100	My lord is dead; Edmund and I have talk'd;
4101	And more convenient is he for my hand
4102	Than for your lady's: you may gather more.
4103	If you do find him, pray you, give him this;
4104	And when your mistress hears thus much from you,
4105	I pray, desire her call her wisdom to her.
4106	So, fare you well.
4107	If you do chance to hear of that blind traitor,
4108	Preferment falls on him that cuts him off.
4109	
4110	OSWALD	Would I could meet him, madam! I should show
4111	What party I do follow.
4112	
4113	REGAN	Fare thee well.

4127	SCENE VI	Fields near Dover.
4128	
4129	
4130	[Enter GLOUCESTER, and EDGAR dressed like a peasant]
4131	
4132	GLOUCESTER	When shall we come to the top of that same hill?
4133	
4134	EDGAR	You do climb up it now: look, how we labour.
4135	
4136	GLOUCESTER	Methinks the ground is even.
4137	
4138	EDGAR	Horrible steep.
4139	Hark, do you hear the sea?
4140	
4141	GLOUCESTER	No, truly.
4142	
4143	EDGAR	Why, then, your other senses grow imperfect
4144	By your eyes' anguish.
4145	
4146	GLOUCESTER	So may it be, indeed:
4147	Methinks thy voice is alter'd; and thou speak'st
4148	In better phrase and matter than thou didst.
4149	
4150	EDGAR	You're much deceived: in nothing am I changed
4151	But in my garments.
4152	
4153	GLOUCESTER	Methinks you're better spoken.
4154	
4155	EDGAR	Come on, sir; here's the place: stand still. How fearful
4156	And dizzy 'tis, to cast one's eyes so low!
4157	The crows and choughs that wing the midway air
4158	Show scarce so gross as beetles: half way down
4159	Hangs one that gathers samphire, dreadful trade!
4160	Methinks he seems no bigger than his head:
4161	The fishermen, that walk upon the beach,
4162	Appear like mice; and yond tall anchoring bark,
4163	Diminish'd to her cock; her cock, a buoy
4164	Almost too small for sight: the murmuring surge,
4165	That on the unnumber'd idle pebbles chafes,
4166	Cannot be heard so high. I'll look no more;
4167	Lest my brain turn, and the deficient sight
4168	Topple down headlong.
4169	
4170	GLOUCESTER	Set me where you stand.
4171	
4172	EDGAR	Give me your hand: you are now within a foot
4173	Of the extreme verge: for all beneath the moon
4174	Would I not leap upright.
4175	
4176	GLOUCESTER	Let go my hand.
4177	Here, friend, 's another purse; in it a jewel
4178	Well worth a poor man's taking: fairies and gods
4179	Prosper it with thee! Go thou farther off;
4180	Bid me farewell, and let me hear thee going.
4181	
4182	EDGAR	Now fare you well, good sir.
4183	
4184	GLOUCESTER	With all my heart.
4185	
4186	EDGAR	Why I do trifle thus with his despair
4187	Is done to cure it.
4188	
4189	GLOUCESTER	[Kneeling]  O you mighty gods!
4190	This world I do renounce, and, in your sights,
4191	Shake patiently my great affliction off:
4192	If I could bear it longer, and not fall
4193	To quarrel with your great opposeless wills,
4194	My snuff and loathed part of nature should
4195	Burn itself out. If Edgar live, O, bless him!
4196	Now, fellow, fare thee well.
4197	
4198	[He falls forward]
4199	
4200	EDGAR	Gone, sir: farewell.
4201	And yet I know not how conceit may rob
4202	The treasury of life, when life itself
4203	Yields to the theft: had he been where he thought,
4204	By this, had thought been past. Alive or dead?
4205	Ho, you sir! friend! Hear you, sir! speak!
4206	Thus might he pass indeed: yet he revives.
4207	What are you, sir?
4208	
4209	GLOUCESTER	                  Away, and let me die.
4210	
4211	EDGAR	Hadst thou been aught but gossamer, feathers, air,
4212	So many fathom down precipitating,
4213	Thou'dst shiver'd like an egg: but thou dost breathe;
4214	Hast heavy substance; bleed'st not; speak'st; art sound.
4215	Ten masts at each make not the altitude
4216	Which thou hast perpendicularly fell:
4217	Thy life's a miracle. Speak yet again.
4218	
4219	GLOUCESTER	But have I fall'n, or no?
4220	
4221	EDGAR	From the dread summit of this chalky bourn.
4222	Look up a-height; the shrill-gorged lark so far
4223	Cannot be seen or heard: do but look up.
4224	
4225	GLOUCESTER	Alack, I have no eyes.
4226	Is wretchedness deprived that benefit,
4227	To end itself by death? 'Twas yet some comfort,
4228	When misery could beguile the tyrant's rage,
4229	And frustrate his proud will.
4230	
4231	EDGAR	Give me your arm:
4232	Up: so. How is 't? Feel you your legs? You stand.
4233	
4234	GLOUCESTER	Too well, too well.
4235	
4236	EDGAR	This is above all strangeness.
4237	Upon the crown o' the cliff, what thing was that
4238	Which parted from you?
4239	
4240	GLOUCESTER	A poor unfortunate beggar.
4241	
4242	EDGAR	As I stood here below, methought his eyes
4243	Were two full moons; he had a thousand noses,
4244	Horns whelk'd and waved like the enridged sea:
4245	It was some fiend; therefore, thou happy father,
4246	Think that the clearest gods, who make them honours
4247	Of men's impossibilities, have preserved thee.
4248	
4249	GLOUCESTER	I do remember now: henceforth I'll bear
4250	Affliction till it do cry out itself
4251	'Enough, enough,' and die. That thing you speak of,
4252	I took it for a man; often 'twould say
4253	'The fiend, the fiend:' he led me to that place.
4254	
4255	EDGAR	Bear free and patient thoughts. But who comes here?
4256	
4257	[Enter KING LEAR, fantastically dressed with wild flowers]
4258	
4259	The safer sense will ne'er accommodate
4260	His master thus.
4261	
4262	KING LEAR	No, they cannot touch me for coining; I am the
4263	king himself.
4264	
4265	EDGAR	O thou side-piercing sight!
4266	
4267	KING LEAR	Nature's above art in that respect. There's your
4268	press-money. That fellow handles his bow like a
4269	crow-keeper: draw me a clothier's yard. Look,
4270	look, a mouse! Peace, peace; this piece of toasted
4271	cheese will do 't. There's my gauntlet; I'll prove
4272	it on a giant. Bring up the brown bills. O, well
4273	flown, bird! i' the clout, i' the clout: hewgh!
4274	Give the word.
4275	
4276	EDGAR	Sweet marjoram.
4277	
4278	KING LEAR	Pass.
4279	
4280	GLOUCESTER	I know that voice.
4281	
4282	KING LEAR	Ha! Goneril, with a white beard! They flattered
4283	me like a dog; and told me I had white hairs in my
4284	beard ere the black ones were there. To say 'ay'
4285	and 'no' to every thing that I said!--'Ay' and 'no'
4286	too was no good divinity. When the rain came to
4287	wet me once, and the wind to make me chatter; when
4288	the thunder would not peace at my bidding; there I
4289	found 'em, there I smelt 'em out. Go to, they are
4290	not men o' their words: they told me I was every
4291	thing; 'tis a lie, I am not ague-proof.
4292	
4293	GLOUCESTER	The trick of that voice I do well remember:
4294	Is 't not the king?
4295	
4296	KING LEAR	Ay, every inch a king:
4297	When I do stare, see how the subject quakes.
4298	I pardon that man's life. What was thy cause? Adultery?
4299	Thou shalt not die: die for adultery! No:
4300	The wren goes to 't, and the small gilded fly
4301	Does lecher in my sight.
4302	Let copulation thrive; for Gloucester's bastard son
4303	Was kinder to his father than my daughters
4304	Got 'tween the lawful sheets.
4305	To 't, luxury, pell-mell! for I lack soldiers.
4306	Behold yond simpering dame,
4307	Whose face between her forks presages snow;
4308	That minces virtue, and does shake the head
4309	To hear of pleasure's name;
4310	The fitchew, nor the soiled horse, goes to 't
4311	With a more riotous appetite.
4312	Down from the waist they are Centaurs,
4313	Though women all above:
4314	But to the girdle do the gods inherit,
4315	Beneath is all the fiends';
4316	There's hell, there's darkness, there's the
4317	sulphurous pit,
4318	Burning, scalding, stench, consumption; fie,
4319	fie, fie! pah, pah! Give me an ounce of civet,
4320	good apothecary, to sweeten my imagination:
4321	there's money for thee.
4322	
4323	GLOUCESTER	O, let me kiss that hand!
4324	
4325	KING LEAR	Let me wipe it first; it smells of mortality.
4326	
4327	GLOUCESTER	O ruin'd piece of nature! This great world
4328	Shall so wear out to nought. Dost thou know me?
4329	
4330	KING LEAR	I remember thine eyes well enough. Dost thou squiny
4331	at me? No, do thy worst, blind Cupid! I'll not
4332	love. Read thou this challenge; mark but the
4333	penning of it.
4334	
4335	GLOUCESTER	Were all the letters suns, I could not see one.
4336	
4337	EDGAR	I would not take this from report; it is,
4338	And my heart breaks at it.
4339	
4340	KING LEAR	Read.
4341	
4342	GLOUCESTER	What, with the case of eyes?
4343	
4344	KING LEAR	O, ho, are you there with me? No eyes in your
4345	head, nor no money in your purse? Your eyes are in
4346	a heavy case, your purse in a light; yet you see how
4347	this world goes.
4348	
4349	GLOUCESTER	I see it feelingly.
4350	
4351	KING LEAR	What, art mad? A man may see how this world goes
4352	with no eyes. Look with thine ears: see how yond
4353	justice rails upon yond simple thief. Hark, in
4354	thine ear: change places; and, handy-dandy, which
4355	is the justice, which is the thief? Thou hast seen
4356	a farmer's dog bark at a beggar?
4357	
4358	GLOUCESTER	Ay, sir.
4359	
4360	KING LEAR	And the creature run from the cur? There thou
4361	mightst behold the great image of authority: a
4362	dog's obeyed in office.
4363	Thou rascal beadle, hold thy bloody hand!
4364	Why dost thou lash that whore? Strip thine own back;
4365	Thou hotly lust'st to use her in that kind
4366	For which thou whipp'st her. The usurer hangs the cozener.
4367	Through tatter'd clothes small vices do appear;
4368	Robes and furr'd gowns hide all. Plate sin with gold,
4369	And the strong lance of justice hurtless breaks:
4370	Arm it in rags, a pigmy's straw does pierce it.
4371	None does offend, none, I say, none; I'll able 'em:
4372	Take that of me, my friend, who have the power
4373	To seal the accuser's lips. Get thee glass eyes;
4374	And like a scurvy politician, seem
4375	To see the things thou dost not. Now, now, now, now:
4376	Pull off my boots: harder, harder: so.
4377	
4378	EDGAR	O, matter and impertinency mix'd! Reason in madness!
4379	
4380	KING LEAR	If thou wilt weep my fortunes, take my eyes.
4381	I know thee well enough; thy name is Gloucester:
4382	Thou must be patient; we came crying hither:
4383	Thou know'st, the first time that we smell the air,
4384	We wawl and cry. I will preach to thee: mark.
4385	
4386	GLOUCESTER	Alack, alack the day!
4387	
4388	KING LEAR	When we are born, we cry that we are come
4389	To this great stage of fools: this a good block;
4390	It were a delicate stratagem, to shoe
4391	A troop of horse with felt: I'll put 't in proof;
4392	And when I have stol'n upon these sons-in-law,
4393	Then, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill!
4394	
4395	[Enter a Gentleman, with Attendants]
4396	
4397	Gentleman	O, here he is: lay hand upon him. Sir,
4398	Your most dear daughter--
4399	
4400	KING LEAR	No rescue? What, a prisoner? I am even
4401	The natural fool of fortune. Use me well;
4402	You shall have ransom. Let me have surgeons;
4403	I am cut to the brains.
4404	
4405	Gentleman	You shall have any thing.
4406	
4407	KING LEAR	No seconds? all myself?
4408	Why, this would make a man a man of salt,
4409	To use his eyes for garden water-pots,
4410	Ay, and laying autumn's dust.
4411	
4412	Gentleman	Good sir,--
4413	
4414	KING LEAR	I will die bravely, like a bridegroom. What!
4415	I will be jovial: come, come; I am a king,
4416	My masters, know you that.
4417	
4418	Gentleman	You are a royal one, and we obey you.
4419	
4420	KING LEAR	Then there's life in't. Nay, if you get it, you
4421	shall get it with running. Sa, sa, sa, sa.
4422	
4423	[Exit running; Attendants follow]
4424	
4425	Gentleman	A sight most pitiful in the meanest wretch,
4426	Past speaking of in a king! Thou hast one daughter,
4427	Who redeems nature from the general curse
4428	Which twain have brought her to.
4429	
4430	EDGAR	Hail, gentle sir.
4431	
4432	Gentleman	                  Sir, speed you: what's your will?
4433	
4434	EDGAR	Do you hear aught, sir, of a battle toward?
4435	
4436	Gentleman	Most sure and vulgar: every one hears that,
4437	Which can distinguish sound.
4438	
4439	EDGAR	But, by your favour,
4440	How near's the other army?
4441	
4442	Gentleman	Near and on speedy foot; the main descry
4443	Stands on the hourly thought.
4444	
4445	EDGAR	I thank you, sir: that's all.
4446	
4447	Gentleman	Though that the queen on special cause is here,
4448	Her army is moved on.
4449	
4450	EDGAR	I thank you, sir.
4451	
4452	[Exit Gentleman]
4453	
4454	GLOUCESTER	You ever-gentle gods, take my breath from me:
4455	Let not my worser spirit tempt me again
4456	To die before you please!
4457	
4458	EDGAR	Well pray you, father.
4459	
4460	GLOUCESTER	Now, good sir, what are you?
4461	
4462	EDGAR	A most poor man, made tame to fortune's blows;
4463	Who, by the art of known and feeling sorrows,
4464	Am pregnant to good pity. Give me your hand,
4465	I'll lead you to some biding.
4466	
4467	GLOUCESTER	Hearty thanks:
4468	The bounty and the benison of heaven
4469	To boot, and boot!
4470	
4471	[Enter OSWALD]
4472	
4473	OSWALD	A proclaim'd prize! Most happy!
4474	That eyeless head of thine was first framed flesh
4475	To raise my fortunes. Thou old unhappy traitor,
4476	Briefly thyself remember: the sword is out
4477	That must destroy thee.
4478	
4479	GLOUCESTER	Now let thy friendly hand
4480	Put strength enough to't.
4481	
4482	[EDGAR interposes]
4483	
4484	OSWALD	Wherefore, bold peasant,
4485	Darest thou support a publish'd traitor? Hence;
4486	Lest that the infection of his fortune take
4487	Like hold on thee. Let go his arm.
4488	
4489	EDGAR	Ch'ill not let go, zir, without vurther 'casion.
4490	
4491	OSWALD	Let go, slave, or thou diest!
4492	
4493	EDGAR	Good gentleman, go your gait, and let poor volk
4494	pass. An chud ha' bin zwaggered out of my life,
4495	'twould not ha' bin zo long as 'tis by a vortnight.
4496	Nay, come not near th' old man; keep out, che vor
4497	ye, or ise try whether your costard or my ballow be
4498	the harder: ch'ill be plain with you.
4499	
4500	OSWALD	Out, dunghill!
4501	
4502	EDGAR	Ch'ill pick your teeth, zir: come; no matter vor
4503	your foins.
4504	
4505	[They fight, and EDGAR knocks him down]
4506	
4507	OSWALD	Slave, thou hast slain me: villain, take my purse:
4508	If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my body;
4509	And give the letters which thou find'st about me
4510	To Edmund earl of Gloucester; seek him out
4511	Upon the British party: O, untimely death!
4512	
4513	[Dies]
4514	
4515	EDGAR	I know thee well: a serviceable villain;
4516	As duteous to the vices of thy mistress
4517	As badness would desire.
4518	
4519	GLOUCESTER	What, is he dead?
4520	
4521	EDGAR	Sit you down, father; rest you
4522	Let's see these pockets: the letters that he speaks of
4523	May be my friends. He's dead; I am only sorry
4524	He had no other death's-man. Let us see:
4525	Leave, gentle wax; and, manners, blame us not:
4526	To know our enemies' minds, we'ld rip their hearts;
4527	Their papers, is more lawful.
4528	
4529	[Reads]
4530	
4531	'Let our reciprocal vows be remembered. You have
4532	many opportunities to cut him off: if your will
4533	want not, time and place will be fruitfully offered.
4534	There is nothing done, if he return the conqueror:
4535	then am I the prisoner, and his bed my goal; from
4536	the loathed warmth whereof deliver me, and supply
4537	the place for your labour.
4538	'Your--wife, so I would say--
4539	'Affectionate servant,
4540	'GONERIL.'
4541	O undistinguish'd space of woman's will!
4542	A plot upon her virtuous husband's life;
4543	And the exchange my brother! Here, in the sands,
4544	Thee I'll rake up, the post unsanctified
4545	Of murderous lechers: and in the mature time
4546	With this ungracious paper strike the sight
4547	Of the death practised duke: for him 'tis well
4548	That of thy death and business I can tell.
4549	
4550	GLOUCESTER	The king is mad: how stiff is my vile sense,
4551	That I stand up, and have ingenious feeling
4552	Of my huge sorrows! Better I were distract:
4553	So should my thoughts be sever'd from my griefs,
4554	And woes by wrong imaginations lose
4555	The knowledge of themselves.
4556	
4557	EDGAR	Give me your hand:
4558	
4559	[Drum afar off]
4560	
4561	Far off, methinks, I hear the beaten drum:
4562	Come, father, I'll bestow you with a friend.

4572	ACT IV
4573	
4574	
4575	
4576	SCENE VII	A tent in the French camp. LEAR on a bed asleep,
4577	soft music playing; Gentleman, and others attending.
4578	
4579	
4580	[Enter CORDELIA, KENT, and Doctor]
4581	
4582	CORDELIA	O thou good Kent, how shall I live and work,
4583	To match thy goodness? My life will be too short,
4584	And every measure fail me.
4585	
4586	KENT	To be acknowledged, madam, is o'erpaid.
4587	All my reports go with the modest truth;
4588	Nor more nor clipp'd, but so.
4589	
4590	CORDELIA	Be better suited:
4591	These weeds are memories of those worser hours:
4592	I prithee, put them off.
4593	
4594	KENT	Pardon me, dear madam;
4595	Yet to be known shortens my made intent:
4596	My boon I make it, that you know me not
4597	Till time and I think meet.
4598	
4599	CORDELIA	Then be't so, my good lord.
4600	
4601	[To the Doctor]
4602	
4603	How does the king?
4604	
4605	Doctor	Madam, sleeps still.
4606	
4607	CORDELIA	O you kind gods,
4608	Cure this great breach in his abused nature!
4609	The untuned and jarring senses, O, wind up
4610	Of this child-changed father!
4611	
4612	Doctor	So please your majesty
4613	That we may wake the king: he hath slept long.
4614	
4615	CORDELIA	Be govern'd by your knowledge, and proceed
4616	I' the sway of your own will. Is he array'd?
4617	
4618	Gentleman	Ay, madam; in the heaviness of his sleep
4619	We put fresh garments on him.
4620	
4621	Doctor	Be by, good madam, when we do awake him;
4622	I doubt not of his temperance.
4623	
4624	CORDELIA	Very well.
4625	
4626	Doctor	Please you, draw near. Louder the music there!
4627	
4628	CORDELIA	O my dear father! Restoration hang
4629	Thy medicine on my lips; and let this kiss
4630	Repair those violent harms that my two sisters
4631	Have in thy reverence made!
4632	
4633	KENT	Kind and dear princess!
4634	
4635	CORDELIA	Had you not been their father, these white flakes
4636	Had challenged pity of them. Was this a face
4637	To be opposed against the warring winds?
4638	To stand against the deep dread-bolted thunder?
4639	In the most terrible and nimble stroke
4640	Of quick, cross lightning? to watch--poor perdu!--
4641	With this thin helm? Mine enemy's dog,
4642	Though he had bit me, should have stood that night
4643	Against my fire; and wast thou fain, poor father,
4644	To hovel thee with swine, and rogues forlorn,
4645	In short and musty straw? Alack, alack!
4646	'Tis wonder that thy life and wits at once
4647	Had not concluded all. He wakes; speak to him.
4648	
4649	Doctor	Madam, do you; 'tis fittest.
4650	
4651	CORDELIA	How does my royal lord? How fares your majesty?
4652	
4653	KING LEAR	You do me wrong to take me out o' the grave:
4654	Thou art a soul in bliss; but I am bound
4655	Upon a wheel of fire, that mine own tears
4656	Do scald like moulten lead.
4657	
4658	CORDELIA	Sir, do you know me?
4659	
4660	KING LEAR	You are a spirit, I know: when did you die?
4661	
4662	CORDELIA	Still, still, far wide!
4663	
4664	Doctor	He's scarce awake: let him alone awhile.
4665	
4666	KING LEAR	Where have I been? Where am I? Fair daylight?
4667	I am mightily abused. I should e'en die with pity,
4668	To see another thus. I know not what to say.
4669	I will not swear these are my hands: let's see;
4670	I feel this pin prick. Would I were assured
4671	Of my condition!
4672	
4673	CORDELIA	                  O, look upon me, sir,
4674	And hold your hands in benediction o'er me:
4675	No, sir, you must not kneel.
4676	
4677	KING LEAR	Pray, do not mock me:
4678	I am a very foolish fond old man,
4679	Fourscore and upward, not an hour more nor less;
4680	And, to deal plainly,
4681	I fear I am not in my perfect mind.
4682	Methinks I should know you, and know this man;
4683	Yet I am doubtful for I am mainly ignorant
4684	What place this is; and all the skill I have
4685	Remembers not these garments; nor I know not
4686	Where I did lodge last night. Do not laugh at me;
4687	For, as I am a man, I think this lady
4688	To be my child Cordelia.
4689	
4690	CORDELIA	And so I am, I am.
4691	
4692	KING LEAR	Be your tears wet? yes, 'faith. I pray, weep not:
4693	If you have poison for me, I will drink it.
4694	I know you do not love me; for your sisters
4695	Have, as I do remember, done me wrong:
4696	You have some cause, they have not.
4697	
4698	CORDELIA	No cause, no cause.
4699	
4700	KING LEAR	Am I in France?
4701	
4702	KENT	                  In your own kingdom, sir.
4703	
4704	KING LEAR	Do not abuse me.
4705	
4706	Doctor	Be comforted, good madam: the great rage,
4707	You see, is kill'd in him: and yet it is danger
4708	To make him even o'er the time he has lost.
4709	Desire him to go in; trouble him no more
4710	Till further settling.
4711	
4712	CORDELIA	Will't please your highness walk?
4713	
4714	KING LEAR	You must bear with me:
4715	Pray you now, forget and forgive: I am old and foolish.
4716	
4717	[Exeunt all but KENT and Gentleman]
4718	
4719	Gentleman	Holds it true, sir, that the Duke of Cornwall was so slain?
4720	
4721	KENT	Most certain, sir.
4722	
4723	Gentleman	Who is conductor of his people?
4724	
4725	KENT	As 'tis said, the bastard son of Gloucester.
4726	
4727	Gentleman	They say Edgar, his banished son, is with the Earl
4728	of Kent in Germany.
4729	
4730	KENT	Report is changeable. 'Tis time to look about; the
4731	powers of the kingdom approach apace.
4732	
4733	Gentleman	The arbitrement is like to be bloody. Fare you
4734	well, sir.
4735	
4736	[Exit]
4737	
4738	KENT	My point and period will be throughly wrought,
4739	Or well or ill, as this day's battle's fought.

4749	ACT V
4750	
4751	
4752	
4753	SCENE I	The British camp, near Dover.
4754	
4755	
4756	[Enter, with drum and colours, EDMUND, REGAN,
4757	Gentlemen, and Soldiers.
4758	
4759	EDMUND	Know of the duke if his last purpose hold,
4760	Or whether since he is advised by aught
4761	To change the course: he's full of alteration
4762	And self-reproving: bring his constant pleasure.
4763	
4764	[To a Gentleman, who goes out]
4765	
4766	REGAN	Our sister's man is certainly miscarried.
4767	
4768	EDMUND	'Tis to be doubted, madam.
4769	
4770	REGAN	Now, sweet lord,
4771	You know the goodness I intend upon you:
4772	Tell me--but truly--but then speak the truth,
4773	Do you not love my sister?
4774	
4775	EDMUND	In honour'd love.
4776	
4777	REGAN	But have you never found my brother's way
4778	To the forfended place?
4779	
4780	EDMUND	That thought abuses you.
4781	
4782	REGAN	I am doubtful that you have been conjunct
4783	And bosom'd with her, as far as we call hers.
4784	
4785	EDMUND	No, by mine honour, madam.
4786	
4787	REGAN	I never shall endure her: dear my lord,
4788	Be not familiar with her.
4789	
4790	EDMUND	Fear me not:
4791	She and the duke her husband!
4792	
4793	[Enter, with drum and colours, ALBANY, GONERIL, and Soldiers]
4794	
4795	GONERIL	[Aside]  I had rather lose the battle than that sister
4796	Should loosen him and me.
4797	
4798	ALBANY	Our very loving sister, well be-met.
4799	Sir, this I hear; the king is come to his daughter,
4800	With others whom the rigor of our state
4801	Forced to cry out. Where I could not be honest,
4802	I never yet was valiant: for this business,
4803	It toucheth us, as France invades our land,
4804	Not bolds the king, with others, whom, I fear,
4805	Most just and heavy causes make oppose.
4806	
4807	EDMUND	Sir, you speak nobly.
4808	
4809	REGAN	Why is this reason'd?
4810	
4811	GONERIL	Combine together 'gainst the enemy;
4812	For these domestic and particular broils
4813	Are not the question here.
4814	
4815	ALBANY	Let's then determine
4816	With the ancient of war on our proceedings.
4817	
4818	EDMUND	I shall attend you presently at your tent.
4819	
4820	REGAN	Sister, you'll go with us?
4821	
4822	GONERIL	No.
4823	
4824	REGAN	'Tis most convenient; pray you, go with us.
4825	
4826	GONERIL	[Aside]  O, ho, I know the riddle.--I will go.
4827	
4828	[As they are going out, enter EDGAR disguised]
4829	
4830	EDGAR	If e'er your grace had speech with man so poor,
4831	Hear me one word.
4832	
4833	ALBANY	                  I'll overtake you. Speak.
4834	
4835	[Exeunt all but ALBANY and EDGAR]
4836	
4837	EDGAR	Before you fight the battle, ope this letter.
4838	If you have victory, let the trumpet sound
4839	For him that brought it: wretched though I seem,
4840	I can produce a champion that will prove
4841	What is avouched there. If you miscarry,
4842	Your business of the world hath so an end,
4843	And machination ceases. Fortune love you.
4844	
4845	ALBANY	Stay till I have read the letter.
4846	
4847	EDGAR	I was forbid it.
4848	When time shall serve, let but the herald cry,
4849	And I'll appear again.
4850	
4851	ALBANY	Why, fare thee well: I will o'erlook thy paper.
4852	
4853	[Exit EDGAR]
4854	
4855	[Re-enter EDMUND]
4856	
4857	EDMUND	The enemy's in view; draw up your powers.
4858	Here is the guess of their true strength and forces
4859	By diligent discovery; but your haste
4860	Is now urged on you.
4861	
4862	ALBANY	We will greet the time.
4863	
4864	[Exit]
4865	
4866	EDMUND	To both these sisters have I sworn my love;
4867	Each jealous of the other, as the stung
4868	Are of the adder. Which of them shall I take?
4869	Both? one? or neither? Neither can be enjoy'd,
4870	If both remain alive: to take the widow
4871	Exasperates, makes mad her sister Goneril;
4872	And hardly shall I carry out my side,
4873	Her husband being alive. Now then we'll use
4874	His countenance for the battle; which being done,
4875	Let her who would be rid of him devise
4876	His speedy taking off. As for the mercy
4877	Which he intends to Lear and to Cordelia,
4878	The battle done, and they within our power,
4879	Shall never see his pardon; for my state
4880	Stands on me to defend, not to debate.

4897	[Alarum within. Enter, with drum and colours,
4898	KING LEAR, CORDELIA, and Soldiers, over the stage;
4899	and exeunt]
4900	
4901	[Enter EDGAR and GLOUCESTER]
4902	
4903	EDGAR	Here, father, take the shadow of this tree
4904	For your good host; pray that the right may thrive:
4905	If ever I return to you again,
4906	I'll bring you comfort.
4907	
4908	GLOUCESTER	Grace go with you, sir!
4909	
4910	[Exit EDGAR]
4911	
4912	[Alarum and retreat within. Re-enter EDGAR]
4913	
4914	EDGAR	Away, old man; give me thy hand; away!
4915	King Lear hath lost, he and his daughter ta'en:
4916	Give me thy hand; come on.
4917	
4918	GLOUCESTER	No farther, sir; a man may rot even here.
4919	
4920	EDGAR	What, in ill thoughts again? Men must endure
4921	Their going hence, even as their coming hither;
4922	Ripeness is all: come on.
4923	
4924	GLOUCESTER	And that's true too.

4938	SCENE III	The British camp near Dover.
4939	
4940	
4941	[Enter, in conquest, with drum and colours, EDMUND,
4942	KING LEAR and CORDELIA, prisoners; Captain,
4943	Soldiers, &c]
4944	
4945	EDMUND	Some officers take them away: good guard,
4946	Until their greater pleasures first be known
4947	That are to censure them.
4948	
4949	CORDELIA	We are not the first
4950	Who, with best meaning, have incurr'd the worst.
4951	For thee, oppressed king, am I cast down;
4952	Myself could else out-frown false fortune's frown.
4953	Shall we not see these daughters and these sisters?
4954	
4955	KING LEAR	No, no, no, no! Come, let's away to prison:
4956	We two alone will sing like birds i' the cage:
4957	When thou dost ask me blessing, I'll kneel down,
4958	And ask of thee forgiveness: so we'll live,
4959	And pray, and sing, and tell old tales, and laugh
4960	At gilded butterflies, and hear poor rogues
4961	Talk of court news; and we'll talk with them too,
4962	Who loses and who wins; who's in, who's out;
4963	And take upon's the mystery of things,
4964	As if we were God's spies: and we'll wear out,
4965	In a wall'd prison, packs and sects of great ones,
4966	That ebb and flow by the moon.
4967	
4968	EDMUND	Take them away.
4969	
4970	KING LEAR	Upon such sacrifices, my Cordelia,
4971	The gods themselves throw incense. Have I caught thee?
4972	He that parts us shall bring a brand from heaven,
4973	And fire us hence like foxes. Wipe thine eyes;
4974	The good-years shall devour them, flesh and fell,
4975	Ere they shall make us weep: we'll see 'em starve
4976	first. Come.
4977	
4978	[Exeunt KING LEAR and CORDELIA, guarded]
4979	
4980	EDMUND	Come hither, captain; hark.
4981	Take thou this note;
4982	
4983	[Giving a paper]
4984	
4985	go follow them to prison:
4986	One step I have advanced thee; if thou dost
4987	As this instructs thee, thou dost make thy way
4988	To noble fortunes: know thou this, that men
4989	Are as the time is: to be tender-minded
4990	Does not become a sword: thy great employment
4991	Will not bear question; either say thou'lt do 't,
4992	Or thrive by other means.
4993	
4994	Captain	I'll do 't, my lord.
4995	
4996	EDMUND	About it; and write happy when thou hast done.
4997	Mark, I say, instantly; and carry it so
4998	As I have set it down.
4999	
5000	Captain	I cannot draw a cart, nor eat dried oats;
5001	If it be man's work, I'll do 't.
5002	
5003	[Exit]
5004	
5005	[Flourish. Enter ALBANY, GONERIL, REGAN, another
5006	Captain, and Soldiers]
5007	
5008	ALBANY	Sir, you have shown to-day your valiant strain,
5009	And fortune led you well: you have the captives
5010	That were the opposites of this day's strife:
5011	We do require them of you, so to use them
5012	As we shall find their merits and our safety
5013	May equally determine.
5014	
5015	EDMUND	Sir, I thought it fit
5016	To send the old and miserable king
5017	To some retention and appointed guard;
5018	Whose age has charms in it, whose title more,
5019	To pluck the common bosom on his side,
5020	An turn our impress'd lances in our eyes
5021	Which do command them. With him I sent the queen;
5022	My reason all the same; and they are ready
5023	To-morrow, or at further space, to appear
5024	Where you shall hold your session. At this time
5025	We sweat and bleed: the friend hath lost his friend;
5026	And the best quarrels, in the heat, are cursed
5027	By those that feel their sharpness:
5028	The question of Cordelia and her father
5029	Requires a fitter place.
5030	
5031	ALBANY	Sir, by your patience,
5032	I hold you but a subject of this war,
5033	Not as a brother.
5034	
5035	REGAN	                  That's as we list to grace him.
5036	Methinks our pleasure might have been demanded,
5037	Ere you had spoke so far. He led our powers;
5038	Bore the commission of my place and person;
5039	The which immediacy may well stand up,
5040	And call itself your brother.
5041	
5042	GONERIL	Not so hot:
5043	In his own grace he doth exalt himself,
5044	More than in your addition.
5045	
5046	REGAN	In my rights,
5047	By me invested, he compeers the best.
5048	
5049	GONERIL	That were the most, if he should husband you.
5050	
5051	REGAN	Jesters do oft prove prophets.
5052	
5053	GONERIL	Holla, holla!
5054	That eye that told you so look'd but a-squint.
5055	
5056	REGAN	Lady, I am not well; else I should answer
5057	From a full-flowing stomach. General,
5058	Take thou my soldiers, prisoners, patrimony;
5059	Dispose of them, of me; the walls are thine:
5060	Witness the world, that I create thee here
5061	My lord and master.
5062	
5063	GONERIL	Mean you to enjoy him?
5064	
5065	ALBANY	The let-alone lies not in your good will.
5066	
5067	EDMUND	Nor in thine, lord.
5068	
5069	ALBANY	Half-blooded fellow, yes.
5070	
5071	REGAN	[To EDMUND]  Let the drum strike, and prove my title thine.
5072	
5073	ALBANY	Stay yet; hear reason. Edmund, I arrest thee
5074	On capital treason; and, in thine attaint,
5075	This gilded serpent
5076	
5077	[Pointing to Goneril]
5078	
5079	For your claim, fair sister,
5080	I bar it in the interest of my wife:
5081	'Tis she is sub-contracted to this lord,
5082	And I, her husband, contradict your bans.
5083	If you will marry, make your loves to me,
5084	My lady is bespoke.
5085	
5086	GONERIL	An interlude!
5087	
5088	ALBANY	Thou art arm'd, Gloucester: let the trumpet sound:
5089	If none appear to prove upon thy head
5090	Thy heinous, manifest, and many treasons,
5091	There is my pledge;
5092	
5093	[Throwing down a glove]
5094	
5095	I'll prove it on thy heart,
5096	Ere I taste bread, thou art in nothing less
5097	Than I have here proclaim'd thee.
5098	
5099	REGAN	Sick, O, sick!
5100	
5101	GONERIL	[Aside]  If not, I'll ne'er trust medicine.
5102	
5103	EDMUND	There's my exchange:
5104	
5105	[Throwing down a glove]
5106	
5107	what in the world he is
5108	That names me traitor, villain-like he lies:
5109	Call by thy trumpet: he that dares approach,
5110	On him, on you, who not? I will maintain
5111	My truth and honour firmly.
5112	
5113	ALBANY	A herald, ho!
5114	
5115	EDMUND	                  A herald, ho, a herald!
5116	
5117	ALBANY	Trust to thy single virtue; for thy soldiers,
5118	All levied in my name, have in my name
5119	Took their discharge.
5120	
5121	REGAN	My sickness grows upon me.
5122	
5123	ALBANY	She is not well; convey her to my tent.
5124	
5125	[Exit Regan, led]
5126	
5127	[Enter a Herald]
5128	
5129	Come hither, herald,--Let the trumpet sound,
5130	And read out this.
5131	
5132	Captain	Sound, trumpet!
5133	
5134	[A trumpet sounds]
5135	
5136	Herald	[Reads]  'If any man of quality or degree within
5137	the lists of the army will maintain upon Edmund,
5138	supposed Earl of Gloucester, that he is a manifold
5139	traitor, let him appear by the third sound of the
5140	trumpet: he is bold in his defence.'
5141	
5142	EDMUND	Sound!
5143	
5144	[First trumpet]
5145	
5146	Herald	Again!
5147	
5148	[Second trumpet]
5149	
5150	Herald	Again!
5151	
5152	[Third trumpet]
5153	
5154	[Trumpet answers within]
5155	
5156	[Enter EDGAR, at the third sound, armed, with a
5157	trumpet before him]
5158	
5159	ALBANY	Ask him his purposes, why he appears
5160	Upon this call o' the trumpet.
5161	
5162	Herald	What are you?
5163	Your name, your quality? and why you answer
5164	This present summons?
5165	
5166	EDGAR	Know, my name is lost;
5167	By treason's tooth bare-gnawn and canker-bit:
5168	Yet am I noble as the adversary
5169	I come to cope.
5170	
5171	ALBANY	                  Which is that adversary?
5172	
5173	EDGAR	What's he that speaks for Edmund Earl of Gloucester?
5174	
5175	EDMUND	Himself: what say'st thou to him?
5176	
5177	EDGAR	Draw thy sword,
5178	That, if my speech offend a noble heart,
5179	Thy arm may do thee justice: here is mine.
5180	Behold, it is the privilege of mine honours,
5181	My oath, and my profession: I protest,
5182	Maugre thy strength, youth, place, and eminence,
5183	Despite thy victor sword and fire-new fortune,
5184	Thy valour and thy heart, thou art a traitor;
5185	False to thy gods, thy brother, and thy father;
5186	Conspirant 'gainst this high-illustrious prince;
5187	And, from the extremest upward of thy head
5188	To the descent and dust below thy foot,
5189	A most toad-spotted traitor. Say thou 'No,'
5190	This sword, this arm, and my best spirits, are bent
5191	To prove upon thy heart, whereto I speak,
5192	Thou liest.
5193	
5194	EDMUND	In wisdom I should ask thy name;
5195	But, since thy outside looks so fair and warlike,
5196	And that thy tongue some say of breeding breathes,
5197	What safe and nicely I might well delay
5198	By rule of knighthood, I disdain and spurn:
5199	Back do I toss these treasons to thy head;
5200	With the hell-hated lie o'erwhelm thy heart;
5201	Which, for they yet glance by and scarcely bruise,
5202	This sword of mine shall give them instant way,
5203	Where they shall rest for ever. Trumpets, speak!
5204	
5205	[Alarums. They fight. EDMUND falls]
5206	
5207	ALBANY	Save him, save him!
5208	
5209	GONERIL	This is practise, Gloucester:
5210	By the law of arms thou wast not bound to answer
5211	An unknown opposite; thou art not vanquish'd,
5212	But cozen'd and beguiled.
5213	
5214	ALBANY	Shut your mouth, dame,
5215	Or with this paper shall I stop it: Hold, sir:
5216	Thou worse than any name, read thine own evil:
5217	No tearing, lady: I perceive you know it.
5218	
5219	[Gives the letter to EDMUND]
5220	
5221	GONERIL	Say, if I do, the laws are mine, not thine:
5222	Who can arraign me for't.
5223	
5224	ALBANY	Most monstrous! oh!
5225	Know'st thou this paper?
5226	
5227	GONERIL	Ask me not what I know.
5228	
5229	[Exit]
5230	
5231	ALBANY	Go after her: she's desperate; govern her.
5232	
5233	EDMUND	What you have charged me with, that have I done;
5234	And more, much more; the time will bring it out:
5235	'Tis past, and so am I. But what art thou
5236	That hast this fortune on me? If thou'rt noble,
5237	I do forgive thee.
5238	
5239	EDGAR	                  Let's exchange charity.
5240	I am no less in blood than thou art, Edmund;
5241	If more, the more thou hast wrong'd me.
5242	My name is Edgar, and thy father's son.
5243	The gods are just, and of our pleasant vices
5244	Make instruments to plague us:
5245	The dark and vicious place where thee he got
5246	Cost him his eyes.
5247	
5248	EDMUND	                  Thou hast spoken right, 'tis true;
5249	The wheel is come full circle: I am here.
5250	
5251	ALBANY	Methought thy very gait did prophesy
5252	A royal nobleness: I must embrace thee:
5253	Let sorrow split my heart, if ever I
5254	Did hate thee or thy father!
5255	
5256	EDGAR	Worthy prince, I know't.
5257	
5258	ALBANY	Where have you hid yourself?
5259	How have you known the miseries of your father?
5260	
5261	EDGAR	By nursing them, my lord. List a brief tale;
5262	And when 'tis told, O, that my heart would burst!
5263	The bloody proclamation to escape,
5264	That follow'd me so near,--O, our lives' sweetness!
5265	That we the pain of death would hourly die
5266	Rather than die at once!--taught me to shift
5267	Into a madman's rags; to assume a semblance
5268	That very dogs disdain'd: and in this habit
5269	Met I my father with his bleeding rings,
5270	Their precious stones new lost: became his guide,
5271	Led him, begg'd for him, saved him from despair;
5272	Never,--O fault!--reveal'd myself unto him,
5273	Until some half-hour past, when I was arm'd:
5274	Not sure, though hoping, of this good success,
5275	I ask'd his blessing, and from first to last
5276	Told him my pilgrimage: but his flaw'd heart,
5277	Alack, too weak the conflict to support!
5278	'Twixt two extremes of passion, joy and grief,
5279	Burst smilingly.
5280	
5281	EDMUND	This speech of yours hath moved me,
5282	And shall perchance do good: but speak you on;
5283	You look as you had something more to say.
5284	
5285	ALBANY	If there be more, more woeful, hold it in;
5286	For I am almost ready to dissolve,
5287	Hearing of this.
5288	
5289	EDGAR	                  This would have seem'd a period
5290	To such as love not sorrow; but another,
5291	To amplify too much, would make much more,
5292	And top extremity.
5293	Whilst I was big in clamour came there in a man,
5294	Who, having seen me in my worst estate,
5295	Shunn'd my abhorr'd society; but then, finding
5296	Who 'twas that so endured, with his strong arms
5297	He fastened on my neck, and bellow'd out
5298	As he'ld burst heaven; threw him on my father;
5299	Told the most piteous tale of Lear and him
5300	That ever ear received: which in recounting
5301	His grief grew puissant and the strings of life
5302	Began to crack: twice then the trumpets sounded,
5303	And there I left him tranced.
5304	
5305	ALBANY	But who was this?
5306	
5307	EDGAR	Kent, sir, the banish'd Kent; who in disguise
5308	Follow'd his enemy king, and did him service
5309	Improper for a slave.
5310	
5311	[Enter a Gentleman, with a bloody knife]
5312	
5313	Gentleman	Help, help, O, help!
5314	
5315	EDGAR	What kind of help?
5316	
5317	ALBANY	Speak, man.
5318	
5319	EDGAR	What means that bloody knife?
5320	
5321	Gentleman	'Tis hot, it smokes;
5322	It came even from the heart of--O, she's dead!
5323	
5324	ALBANY	Who dead? speak, man.
5325	
5326	Gentleman	Your lady, sir, your lady: and her sister
5327	By her is poisoned; she hath confess'd it.
5328	
5329	EDMUND	I was contracted to them both: all three
5330	Now marry in an instant.
5331	
5332	EDGAR	Here comes Kent.
5333	
5334	ALBANY	Produce their bodies, be they alive or dead:
5335	This judgment of the heavens, that makes us tremble,
5336	Touches us not with pity.
5337	
5338	[Exit Gentleman]
5339	
5340	[Enter KENT]
5341	
5342	O, is this he?
5343	The time will not allow the compliment
5344	Which very manners urges.
5345	
5346	KENT	I am come
5347	To bid my king and master aye good night:
5348	Is he not here?
5349	
5350	ALBANY	                  Great thing of us forgot!
5351	Speak, Edmund, where's the king? and where's Cordelia?
5352	See'st thou this object, Kent?
5353	
5354	[The bodies of GONERIL and REGAN are brought in]
5355	
5356	KENT	Alack, why thus?
5357	
5358	EDMUND	                  Yet Edmund was beloved:
5359	The one the other poison'd for my sake,
5360	And after slew herself.
5361	
5362	ALBANY	Even so. Cover their faces.
5363	
5364	EDMUND	I pant for life: some good I mean to do,
5365	Despite of mine own nature. Quickly send,
5366	Be brief in it, to the castle; for my writ
5367	Is on the life of Lear and on Cordelia:
5368	Nay, send in time.
5369	
5370	ALBANY	                  Run, run, O, run!
5371	
5372	EDGAR	To who, my lord? Who hath the office? send
5373	Thy token of reprieve.
5374	
5375	EDMUND	Well thought on: take my sword,
5376	Give it the captain.
5377	
5378	ALBANY	Haste thee, for thy life.
5379	
5380	[Exit EDGAR]
5381	
5382	EDMUND	He hath commission from thy wife and me
5383	To hang Cordelia in the prison, and
5384	To lay the blame upon her own despair,
5385	That she fordid herself.
5386	
5387	ALBANY	The gods defend her! Bear him hence awhile.
5388	
5389	[EDMUND is borne off]
5390	
5391	[Re-enter KING LEAR, with CORDELIA dead in his arms;
5392	EDGAR, Captain, and others following]
5393	
5394	KING LEAR	Howl, howl, howl, howl! O, you are men of stones:
5395	Had I your tongues and eyes, I'ld use them so
5396	That heaven's vault should crack. She's gone for ever!
5397	I know when one is dead, and when one lives;
5398	She's dead as earth. Lend me a looking-glass;
5399	If that her breath will mist or stain the stone,
5400	Why, then she lives.
5401	
5402	KENT	Is this the promised end
5403	
5404	EDGAR	Or image of that horror?
5405	
5406	ALBANY	Fall, and cease!
5407	
5408	KING LEAR	This feather stirs; she lives! if it be so,
5409	It is a chance which does redeem all sorrows
5410	That ever I have felt.
5411	
5412	KENT	[Kneeling]  O my good master!
5413	
5414	KING LEAR	Prithee, away.
5415	
5416	EDGAR	'Tis noble Kent, your friend.
5417	
5418	KING LEAR	A plague upon you, murderers, traitors all!
5419	I might have saved her; now she's gone for ever!
5420	Cordelia, Cordelia! stay a little. Ha!
5421	What is't thou say'st? Her voice was ever soft,
5422	Gentle, and low, an excellent thing in woman.
5423	I kill'd the slave that was a-hanging thee.
5424	
5425	Captain	'Tis true, my lords, he did.
5426	
5427	KING LEAR	Did I not, fellow?
5428	I have seen the day, with my good biting falchion
5429	I would have made them skip: I am old now,
5430	And these same crosses spoil me. Who are you?
5431	Mine eyes are not o' the best: I'll tell you straight.
5432	
5433	KENT	If fortune brag of two she loved and hated,
5434	One of them we behold.
5435	
5436	KING LEAR	This is a dull sight. Are you not Kent?
5437	
5438	KENT	The same,
5439	Your servant Kent: Where is your servant Caius?
5440	
5441	KING LEAR	He's a good fellow, I can tell you that;
5442	He'll strike, and quickly too: he's dead and rotten.
5443	
5444	KENT	No, my good lord; I am the very man,--
5445	
5446	KING LEAR	I'll see that straight.
5447	
5448	KENT	That, from your first of difference and decay,
5449	Have follow'd your sad steps.
5450	
5451	KING LEAR	You are welcome hither.
5452	
5453	KENT	Nor no man else: all's cheerless, dark, and deadly.
5454	Your eldest daughters have fordone them selves,
5455	And desperately are dead.
5456	
5457	KING LEAR	Ay, so I think.
5458	
5459	ALBANY	He knows not what he says: and vain it is
5460	That we present us to him.
5461	
5462	EDGAR	Very bootless.
5463	
5464	[Enter a Captain]
5465	
5466	Captain	Edmund is dead, my lord.
5467	
5468	ALBANY	That's but a trifle here.
5469	You lords and noble friends, know our intent.
5470	What comfort to this great decay may come
5471	Shall be applied: for us we will resign,
5472	During the life of this old majesty,
5473	To him our absolute power:
5474	
5475	[To EDGAR and KENT]
5476	
5477	you, to your rights:
5478	With boot, and such addition as your honours
5479	Have more than merited. All friends shall taste
5480	The wages of their virtue, and all foes
5481	The cup of their deservings. O, see, see!
5482	
5483	KING LEAR	And my poor fool is hang'd! No, no, no life!
5484	Why should a dog, a horse, a rat, have life,
5485	And thou no breath at all? Thou'lt come no more,
5486	Never, never, never, never, never!
5487	Pray you, undo this button: thank you, sir.
5488	Do you see this? Look on her, look, her lips,
5489	Look there, look there!
5490	
5491	[Dies]
5492	
5493	EDGAR	He faints! My lord, my lord!
5494	
5495	KENT	Break, heart; I prithee, break!
5496	
5497	EDGAR	Look up, my lord.
5498	
5499	KENT	Vex not his ghost: O, let him pass! he hates him much
5500	That would upon the rack of this tough world
5501	Stretch him out longer.
5502	
5503	EDGAR	He is gone, indeed.
5504	
5505	KENT	The wonder is, he hath endured so long:
5506	He but usurp'd his life.
5507	
5508	ALBANY	Bear them from hence. Our present business
5509	Is general woe.
5510	
5511	[To KENT and EDGAR]
5512	
5513	Friends of my soul, you twain
5514	Rule in this realm, and the gored state sustain.
5515	
5516	KENT	I have a journey, sir, shortly to go;
5517	My master calls me, I must not say no.
5518	
5519	ALBANY	The weight of this sad time we must obey;
5520	Speak what we feel, not what we ought to say.
5521	The oldest hath borne most: we that are young
5522	Shall never see so much, nor live so long.
5523	
5524	[Exeunt, with a dead march]

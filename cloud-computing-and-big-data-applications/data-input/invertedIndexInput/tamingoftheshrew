80	INDUCTION
81	
82	
83	
84	SCENE I	Before an alehouse on a heath.
85	
86	
87	[Enter Hostess and SLY]
88	
89	SLY	I'll pheeze you, in faith.
90	
91	Hostess	A pair of stocks, you rogue!
92	
93	SLY	Ye are a baggage: the Slys are no rogues; look in
94	the chronicles; we came in with Richard Conqueror.
95	Therefore paucas pallabris; let the world slide: sessa!
96	
97	Hostess	You will not pay for the glasses you have burst?
98	
99	SLY	No, not a denier. Go by, Jeronimy: go to thy cold
100	bed, and warm thee.
101	
102	Hostess	I know my remedy; I must go fetch the
103	third--borough.
104	
105	[Exit]
106	
107	SLY	Third, or fourth, or fifth borough, I'll answer him
108	by law: I'll not budge an inch, boy: let him come,
109	and kindly.
110	
111	[Falls asleep]
112	
113	[Horns winded. Enter a Lord from hunting, with his train]
114	
115	Lord	Huntsman, I charge thee, tender well my hounds:
116	Brach Merriman, the poor cur is emboss'd;
117	And couple Clowder with the deep--mouth'd brach.
118	Saw'st thou not, boy, how Silver made it good
119	At the hedge-corner, in the coldest fault?
120	I would not lose the dog for twenty pound.
121	
122	First Huntsman	Why, Belman is as good as he, my lord;
123	He cried upon it at the merest loss
124	And twice to-day pick'd out the dullest scent:
125	Trust me, I take him for the better dog.
126	
127	Lord	Thou art a fool: if Echo were as fleet,
128	I would esteem him worth a dozen such.
129	But sup them well and look unto them all:
130	To-morrow I intend to hunt again.
131	
132	First Huntsman	I will, my lord.
133	
134	Lord	What's here? one dead, or drunk? See, doth he breathe?
135	
136	Second Huntsman	He breathes, my lord. Were he not warm'd with ale,
137	This were a bed but cold to sleep so soundly.
138	
139	Lord	O monstrous beast! how like a swine he lies!
140	Grim death, how foul and loathsome is thine image!
141	Sirs, I will practise on this drunken man.
142	What think you, if he were convey'd to bed,
143	Wrapp'd in sweet clothes, rings put upon his fingers,
144	A most delicious banquet by his bed,
145	And brave attendants near him when he wakes,
146	Would not the beggar then forget himself?
147	
148	First Huntsman	Believe me, lord, I think he cannot choose.
149	
150	Second Huntsman	It would seem strange unto him when he waked.
151	
152	Lord	Even as a flattering dream or worthless fancy.
153	Then take him up and manage well the jest:
154	Carry him gently to my fairest chamber
155	And hang it round with all my wanton pictures:
156	Balm his foul head in warm distilled waters
157	And burn sweet wood to make the lodging sweet:
158	Procure me music ready when he wakes,
159	To make a dulcet and a heavenly sound;
160	And if he chance to speak, be ready straight
161	And with a low submissive reverence
162	Say 'What is it your honour will command?'
163	Let one attend him with a silver basin
164	Full of rose-water and bestrew'd with flowers,
165	Another bear the ewer, the third a diaper,
166	And say 'Will't please your lordship cool your hands?'
167	Some one be ready with a costly suit
168	And ask him what apparel he will wear;
169	Another tell him of his hounds and horse,
170	And that his lady mourns at his disease:
171	Persuade him that he hath been lunatic;
172	And when he says he is, say that he dreams,
173	For he is nothing but a mighty lord.
174	This do and do it kindly, gentle sirs:
175	It will be pastime passing excellent,
176	If it be husbanded with modesty.
177	
178	First Huntsman	My lord, I warrant you we will play our part,
179	As he shall think by our true diligence
180	He is no less than what we say he is.
181	
182	Lord	Take him up gently and to bed with him;
183	And each one to his office when he wakes.
184	
185	[Some bear out SLY. A trumpet sounds]
186	
187	Sirrah, go see what trumpet 'tis that sounds:
188	
189	[Exit Servingman]
190	
191	Belike, some noble gentleman that means,
192	Travelling some journey, to repose him here.
193	
194	[Re-enter Servingman]
195	
196	How now! who is it?
197	
198	Servant	An't please your honour, players
199	That offer service to your lordship.
200	
201	Lord	Bid them come near.
202	
203	[Enter Players]
204	
205	Now, fellows, you are welcome.
206	
207	Players	We thank your honour.
208	
209	Lord	Do you intend to stay with me tonight?
210	
211	A Player	So please your lordship to accept our duty.
212	
213	Lord	With all my heart. This fellow I remember,
214	Since once he play'd a farmer's eldest son:
215	'Twas where you woo'd the gentlewoman so well:
216	I have forgot your name; but, sure, that part
217	Was aptly fitted and naturally perform'd.
218	
219	A Player	I think 'twas Soto that your honour means.
220	
221	Lord	'Tis very true: thou didst it excellent.
222	Well, you are come to me in a happy time;
223	The rather for I have some sport in hand
224	Wherein your cunning can assist me much.
225	There is a lord will hear you play to-night:
226	But I am doubtful of your modesties;
227	Lest over-eyeing of his odd behavior,--
228	For yet his honour never heard a play--
229	You break into some merry passion
230	And so offend him; for I tell you, sirs,
231	If you should smile he grows impatient.
232	
233	A Player	Fear not, my lord: we can contain ourselves,
234	Were he the veriest antic in the world.
235	
236	Lord	Go, sirrah, take them to the buttery,
237	And give them friendly welcome every one:
238	Let them want nothing that my house affords.
239	
240	[Exit one with the Players]
241	
242	Sirrah, go you to Barthol'mew my page,
243	And see him dress'd in all suits like a lady:
244	That done, conduct him to the drunkard's chamber;
245	And call him 'madam,' do him obeisance.
246	Tell him from me, as he will win my love,
247	He bear himself with honourable action,
248	Such as he hath observed in noble ladies
249	Unto their lords, by them accomplished:
250	Such duty to the drunkard let him do
251	With soft low tongue and lowly courtesy,
252	And say 'What is't your honour will command,
253	Wherein your lady and your humble wife
254	May show her duty and make known her love?'
255	And then with kind embracements, tempting kisses,
256	And with declining head into his bosom,
257	Bid him shed tears, as being overjoy'd
258	To see her noble lord restored to health,
259	Who for this seven years hath esteem'd him
260	No better than a poor and loathsome beggar:
261	And if the boy have not a woman's gift
262	To rain a shower of commanded tears,
263	An onion will do well for such a shift,
264	Which in a napkin being close convey'd
265	Shall in despite enforce a watery eye.
266	See this dispatch'd with all the haste thou canst:
267	Anon I'll give thee more instructions.
268	
269	[Exit a Servingman]
270	
271	I know the boy will well usurp the grace,
272	Voice, gait and action of a gentlewoman:
273	I long to hear him call the drunkard husband,
274	And how my men will stay themselves from laughter
275	When they do homage to this simple peasant.
276	I'll in to counsel them; haply my presence
277	May well abate the over-merry spleen
278	Which otherwise would grow into extremes.

289	
290	
291	SCENE II	A bedchamber in the Lord's house.
292	
293	
294	[Enter aloft SLY, with Attendants; some with apparel,
295	others with basin and ewer and appurtenances; and Lord]
296	
297	SLY	For God's sake, a pot of small ale.
298	
299	First Servant	Will't please your lordship drink a cup of sack?
300	
301	Second Servant	Will't please your honour taste of these conserves?
302	
303	Third Servant	What raiment will your honour wear to-day?
304	
305	SLY	I am Christophero Sly; call not me 'honour' nor
306	'lordship:' I ne'er drank sack in my life; and if
307	you give me any conserves, give me conserves of
308	beef: ne'er ask me what raiment I'll wear; for I
309	have no more doublets than backs, no more stockings
310	than legs, nor no more shoes than feet; nay,
311	sometimes more feet than shoes, or such shoes as my
312	toes look through the over-leather.
313	
314	Lord	Heaven cease this idle humour in your honour!
315	O, that a mighty man of such descent,
316	Of such possessions and so high esteem,
317	Should be infused with so foul a spirit!
318	
319	SLY	What, would you make me mad? Am not I Christopher
320	Sly, old Sly's son of Burtonheath, by birth a
321	pedlar, by education a cardmaker, by transmutation a
322	bear-herd, and now by present profession a tinker?
323	Ask Marian Hacket, the fat ale-wife of Wincot, if
324	she know me not: if she say I am not fourteen pence
325	on the score for sheer ale, score me up for the
326	lyingest knave in Christendom. What! I am not
327	bestraught: here's--
328	
329	Third Servant	O, this it is that makes your lady mourn!
330	
331	Second Servant	O, this is it that makes your servants droop!
332	
333	Lord	Hence comes it that your kindred shuns your house,
334	As beaten hence by your strange lunacy.
335	O noble lord, bethink thee of thy birth,
336	Call home thy ancient thoughts from banishment
337	And banish hence these abject lowly dreams.
338	Look how thy servants do attend on thee,
339	Each in his office ready at thy beck.
340	Wilt thou have music? hark! Apollo plays,
341	
342	[Music]
343	
344	And twenty caged nightingales do sing:
345	Or wilt thou sleep? we'll have thee to a couch
346	Softer and sweeter than the lustful bed
347	On purpose trimm'd up for Semiramis.
348	Say thou wilt walk; we will bestrew the ground:
349	Or wilt thou ride? thy horses shall be trapp'd,
350	Their harness studded all with gold and pearl.
351	Dost thou love hawking? thou hast hawks will soar
352	Above the morning lark or wilt thou hunt?
353	Thy hounds shall make the welkin answer them
354	And fetch shrill echoes from the hollow earth.
355	
356	First Servant	Say thou wilt course; thy greyhounds are as swift
357	As breathed stags, ay, fleeter than the roe.
358	
359	Second Servant	Dost thou love pictures? we will fetch thee straight
360	Adonis painted by a running brook,
361	And Cytherea all in sedges hid,
362	Which seem to move and wanton with her breath,
363	Even as the waving sedges play with wind.
364	
365	Lord	We'll show thee Io as she was a maid,
366	And how she was beguiled and surprised,
367	As lively painted as the deed was done.
368	
369	Third Servant	Or Daphne roaming through a thorny wood,
370	Scratching her legs that one shall swear she bleeds,
371	And at that sight shall sad Apollo weep,
372	So workmanly the blood and tears are drawn.
373	
374	Lord	Thou art a lord, and nothing but a lord:
375	Thou hast a lady far more beautiful
376	Than any woman in this waning age.
377	
378	First Servant	And till the tears that she hath shed for thee
379	Like envious floods o'er-run her lovely face,
380	She was the fairest creature in the world;
381	And yet she is inferior to none.
382	
383	SLY	Am I a lord? and have I such a lady?
384	Or do I dream? or have I dream'd till now?
385	I do not sleep: I see, I hear, I speak;
386	I smell sweet savours and I feel soft things:
387	Upon my life, I am a lord indeed
388	And not a tinker nor Christophero Sly.
389	Well, bring our lady hither to our sight;
390	And once again, a pot o' the smallest ale.
391	
392	Second Servant	Will't please your mightiness to wash your hands?
393	O, how we joy to see your wit restored!
394	O, that once more you knew but what you are!
395	These fifteen years you have been in a dream;
396	Or when you waked, so waked as if you slept.
397	
398	SLY	These fifteen years! by my fay, a goodly nap.
399	But did I never speak of all that time?
400	
401	First Servant	O, yes, my lord, but very idle words:
402	For though you lay here in this goodly chamber,
403	Yet would you say ye were beaten out of door;
404	And rail upon the hostess of the house;
405	And say you would present her at the leet,
406	Because she brought stone jugs and no seal'd quarts:
407	Sometimes you would call out for Cicely Hacket.
408	
409	SLY	Ay, the woman's maid of the house.
410	
411	Third Servant	Why, sir, you know no house nor no such maid,
412	Nor no such men as you have reckon'd up,
413	As Stephen Sly and did John Naps of Greece
414	And Peter Turph and Henry Pimpernell
415	And twenty more such names and men as these
416	Which never were nor no man ever saw.
417	
418	SLY	Now Lord be thanked for my good amends!
419	
420	ALL	Amen.
421	
422	SLY	I thank thee: thou shalt not lose by it.
423	
424	[Enter the Page as a lady, with attendants]
425	
426	Page	How fares my noble lord?
427	
428	SLY	Marry, I fare well for here is cheer enough.
429	Where is my wife?
430	
431	Page	Here, noble lord: what is thy will with her?
432	
433	SLY	Are you my wife and will not call me husband?
434	My men should call me 'lord:' I am your goodman.
435	
436	Page	My husband and my lord, my lord and husband;
437	I am your wife in all obedience.
438	
439	SLY	I know it well. What must I call her?
440	
441	Lord	Madam.
442	
443	SLY	Al'ce madam, or Joan madam?
444	
445	Lord	'Madam,' and nothing else: so lords
446	call ladies.
447	
448	SLY	Madam wife, they say that I have dream'd
449	And slept above some fifteen year or more.
450	
451	Page	Ay, and the time seems thirty unto me,
452	Being all this time abandon'd from your bed.
453	
454	SLY	'Tis much. Servants, leave me and her alone.
455	Madam, undress you and come now to bed.
456	
457	Page	Thrice noble lord, let me entreat of you
458	To pardon me yet for a night or two,
459	Or, if not so, until the sun be set:
460	For your physicians have expressly charged,
461	In peril to incur your former malady,
462	That I should yet absent me from your bed:
463	I hope this reason stands for my excuse.
464	
465	SLY	Ay, it stands so that I may hardly
466	tarry so long. But I would be loath to fall into
467	my dreams again: I will therefore tarry in
468	despite of the flesh and the blood.
469	
470	[Enter a Messenger]
471	
472	Messenger	Your honour's players, heating your amendment,
473	Are come to play a pleasant comedy;
474	For so your doctors hold it very meet,
475	Seeing too much sadness hath congeal'd your blood,
476	And melancholy is the nurse of frenzy:
477	Therefore they thought it good you hear a play
478	And frame your mind to mirth and merriment,
479	Which bars a thousand harms and lengthens life.
480	
481	SLY	Marry, I will, let them play it. Is not a
482	comondy a Christmas gambold or a tumbling-trick?
483	
484	Page	No, my good lord; it is more pleasing stuff.
485	
486	SLY	What, household stuff?
487	
488	Page	It is a kind of history.
489	
490	SLY	Well, well see't. Come, madam wife, sit by my side
491	and let the world slip: we shall ne'er be younger.

500	
501	ACT I
502	
503	
504	
505	SCENE I	Padua. A public place.
506	
507	
508	[Enter LUCENTIO and his man TRANIO]
509	
510	LUCENTIO	Tranio, since for the great desire I had
511	To see fair Padua, nursery of arts,
512	I am arrived for fruitful Lombardy,
513	The pleasant garden of great Italy;
514	And by my father's love and leave am arm'd
515	With his good will and thy good company,
516	My trusty servant, well approved in all,
517	Here let us breathe and haply institute
518	A course of learning and ingenious studies.
519	Pisa renown'd for grave citizens
520	Gave me my being and my father first,
521	A merchant of great traffic through the world,
522	Vincetino come of Bentivolii.
523	Vincetino's son brought up in Florence
524	It shall become to serve all hopes conceived,
525	To deck his fortune with his virtuous deeds:
526	And therefore, Tranio, for the time I study,
527	Virtue and that part of philosophy
528	Will I apply that treats of happiness
529	By virtue specially to be achieved.
530	Tell me thy mind; for I have Pisa left
531	And am to Padua come, as he that leaves
532	A shallow plash to plunge him in the deep
533	And with satiety seeks to quench his thirst.
534	
535	TRANIO	Mi perdonato, gentle master mine,
536	I am in all affected as yourself;
537	Glad that you thus continue your resolve
538	To suck the sweets of sweet philosophy.
539	Only, good master, while we do admire
540	This virtue and this moral discipline,
541	Let's be no stoics nor no stocks, I pray;
542	Or so devote to Aristotle's cheques
543	As Ovid be an outcast quite abjured:
544	Balk logic with acquaintance that you have
545	And practise rhetoric in your common talk;
546	Music and poesy use to quicken you;
547	The mathematics and the metaphysics,
548	Fall to them as you find your stomach serves you;
549	No profit grows where is no pleasure ta'en:
550	In brief, sir, study what you most affect.
551	
552	LUCENTIO	Gramercies, Tranio, well dost thou advise.
553	If, Biondello, thou wert come ashore,
554	We could at once put us in readiness,
555	And take a lodging fit to entertain
556	Such friends as time in Padua shall beget.
557	But stay a while: what company is this?
558	
559	TRANIO	Master, some show to welcome us to town.
560	
561	[Enter BAPTISTA, KATHARINA, BIANCA, GREMIO, and
562	HORTENSIO. LUCENTIO and TRANIO stand by]
563	
564	BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, importune me no farther,
565	For how I firmly am resolved you know;
566	That is, not bestow my youngest daughter
567	Before I have a husband for the elder:
568	If either of you both love Katharina,
569	Because I know you well and love you well,
570	Leave shall you have to court her at your pleasure.
571	
572	GREMIO	[Aside]  To cart her rather: she's too rough for me.
573	There, There, Hortensio, will you any wife?
574	
575	KATHARINA	I pray you, sir, is it your will
576	To make a stale of me amongst these mates?
577	
578	HORTENSIO	Mates, maid! how mean you that? no mates for you,
579	Unless you were of gentler, milder mould.
580	
581	KATHARINA	I'faith, sir, you shall never need to fear:
582	I wis it is not half way to her heart;
583	But if it were, doubt not her care should be
584	To comb your noddle with a three-legg'd stool
585	And paint your face and use you like a fool.
586	
587	HORTENSIA	From all such devils, good Lord deliver us!
588	
589	GREMIO	And me too, good Lord!
590	
591	TRANIO	Hush, master! here's some good pastime toward:
592	That wench is stark mad or wonderful froward.
593	
594	LUCENTIO	But in the other's silence do I see
595	Maid's mild behavior and sobriety.
596	Peace, Tranio!
597	
598	TRANIO	Well said, master; mum! and gaze your fill.
599	
600	BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, that I may soon make good
601	What I have said, Bianca, get you in:
602	And let it not displease thee, good Bianca,
603	For I will love thee ne'er the less, my girl.
604	
605	KATHARINA	A pretty peat! it is best
606	Put finger in the eye, an she knew why.
607	
608	BIANCA	Sister, content you in my discontent.
609	Sir, to your pleasure humbly I subscribe:
610	My books and instruments shall be my company,
611	On them to took and practise by myself.
612	
613	LUCENTIO	Hark, Tranio! thou may'st hear Minerva speak.
614	
615	HORTENSIO	Signior Baptista, will you be so strange?
616	Sorry am I that our good will effects
617	Bianca's grief.
618	
619	GREMIO	                  Why will you mew her up,
620	Signior Baptista, for this fiend of hell,
621	And make her bear the penance of her tongue?
622	
623	BAPTISTA	Gentlemen, content ye; I am resolved:
624	Go in, Bianca:
625	
626	[Exit BIANCA]
627	
628	And for I know she taketh most delight
629	In music, instruments and poetry,
630	Schoolmasters will I keep within my house,
631	Fit to instruct her youth. If you, Hortensio,
632	Or Signior Gremio, you, know any such,
633	Prefer them hither; for to cunning men
634	I will be very kind, and liberal
635	To mine own children in good bringing up:
636	And so farewell. Katharina, you may stay;
637	For I have more to commune with Bianca.
638	
639	[Exit]
640	
641	KATHARINA	Why, and I trust I may go too, may I not? What,
642	shall I be appointed hours; as though, belike, I
643	knew not what to take and what to leave, ha?
644	
645	[Exit]
646	
647	GREMIO	You may go to the devil's dam: your gifts are so
648	good, here's none will hold you. Their love is not
649	so great, Hortensio, but we may blow our nails
650	together, and fast it fairly out: our cakes dough on
651	both sides. Farewell: yet for the love I bear my
652	sweet Bianca, if I can by any means light on a fit
653	man to teach her that wherein she delights, I will
654	wish him to her father.
655	
656	HORTENSIO	So will I, Signior Gremio: but a word, I pray.
657	Though the nature of our quarrel yet never brooked
658	parle, know now, upon advice, it toucheth us both,
659	that we may yet again have access to our fair
660	mistress and be happy rivals in Bianco's love, to
661	labour and effect one thing specially.
662	
663	GREMIO	What's that, I pray?
664	
665	HORTENSIO	Marry, sir, to get a husband for her sister.
666	
667	GREMIO	A husband! a devil.
668	
669	HORTENSIO	I say, a husband.
670	
671	GREMIO	I say, a devil. Thinkest thou, Hortensio, though
672	her father be very rich, any man is so very a fool
673	to be married to hell?
674	
675	HORTENSIO	Tush, Gremio, though it pass your patience and mine
676	to endure her loud alarums, why, man, there be good
677	fellows in the world, an a man could light on them,
678	would take her with all faults, and money enough.
679	
680	GREMIO	I cannot tell; but I had as lief take her dowry with
681	this condition, to be whipped at the high cross
682	every morning.
683	
684	HORTENSIO	Faith, as you say, there's small choice in rotten
685	apples. But come; since this bar in law makes us
686	friends, it shall be so far forth friendly
687	maintained all by helping Baptista's eldest daughter
688	to a husband we set his youngest free for a husband,
689	and then have to't a fresh. Sweet Bianca! Happy man
690	be his dole! He that runs fastest gets the ring.
691	How say you, Signior Gremio?
692	
693	GREMIO	I am agreed; and would I had given him the best
694	horse in Padua to begin his wooing that would
695	thoroughly woo her, wed her and bed her and rid the
696	house of her! Come on.
697	
698	[Exeunt GREMIO and HORTENSIO]
699	
700	TRANIO	I pray, sir, tell me, is it possible
701	That love should of a sudden take such hold?
702	
703	LUCENTIO	O Tranio, till I found it to be true,
704	I never thought it possible or likely;
705	But see, while idly I stood looking on,
706	I found the effect of love in idleness:
707	And now in plainness do confess to thee,
708	That art to me as secret and as dear
709	As Anna to the queen of Carthage was,
710	Tranio, I burn, I pine, I perish, Tranio,
711	If I achieve not this young modest girl.
712	Counsel me, Tranio, for I know thou canst;
713	Assist me, Tranio, for I know thou wilt.
714	
715	TRANIO	Master, it is no time to chide you now;
716	Affection is not rated from the heart:
717	If love have touch'd you, nought remains but so,
718	'Redime te captum quam queas minimo.'
719	
720	LUCENTIO	Gramercies, lad, go forward; this contents:
721	The rest will comfort, for thy counsel's sound.
722	
723	TRANIO	Master, you look'd so longly on the maid,
724	Perhaps you mark'd not what's the pith of all.
725	
726	LUCENTIO	O yes, I saw sweet beauty in her face,
727	Such as the daughter of Agenor had,
728	That made great Jove to humble him to her hand.
729	When with his knees he kiss'd the Cretan strand.
730	
731	TRANIO	Saw you no more? mark'd you not how her sister
732	Began to scold and raise up such a storm
733	That mortal ears might hardly endure the din?
734	
735	LUCENTIO	Tranio, I saw her coral lips to move
736	And with her breath she did perfume the air:
737	Sacred and sweet was all I saw in her.
738	
739	TRANIO	Nay, then, 'tis time to stir him from his trance.
740	I pray, awake, sir: if you love the maid,
741	Bend thoughts and wits to achieve her. Thus it stands:
742	Her eldest sister is so curst and shrewd
743	That till the father rid his hands of her,
744	Master, your love must live a maid at home;
745	And therefore has he closely mew'd her up,
746	Because she will not be annoy'd with suitors.
747	
748	LUCENTIO	Ah, Tranio, what a cruel father's he!
749	But art thou not advised, he took some care
750	To get her cunning schoolmasters to instruct her?
751	
752	TRANIO	Ay, marry, am I, sir; and now 'tis plotted.
753	
754	LUCENTIO	I have it, Tranio.
755	
756	TRANIO	                  Master, for my hand,
757	Both our inventions meet and jump in one.
758	
759	LUCENTIO	Tell me thine first.
760	
761	TRANIO	You will be schoolmaster
762	And undertake the teaching of the maid:
763	That's your device.
764	
765	LUCENTIO	It is: may it be done?
766	
767	TRANIO	Not possible; for who shall bear your part,
768	And be in Padua here Vincentio's son,
769	Keep house and ply his book, welcome his friends,
770	Visit his countrymen and banquet them?
771	
772	LUCENTIO	Basta; content thee, for I have it full.
773	We have not yet been seen in any house,
774	Nor can we lie distinguish'd by our faces
775	For man or master; then it follows thus;
776	Thou shalt be master, Tranio, in my stead,
777	Keep house and port and servants as I should:
778	I will some other be, some Florentine,
779	Some Neapolitan, or meaner man of Pisa.
780	'Tis hatch'd and shall be so: Tranio, at once
781	Uncase thee; take my colour'd hat and cloak:
782	When Biondello comes, he waits on thee;
783	But I will charm him first to keep his tongue.
784	
785	TRANIO	So had you need.
786	In brief, sir, sith it your pleasure is,
787	And I am tied to be obedient;
788	For so your father charged me at our parting,
789	'Be serviceable to my son,' quoth he,
790	Although I think 'twas in another sense;
791	I am content to be Lucentio,
792	Because so well I love Lucentio.
793	
794	LUCENTIO	Tranio, be so, because Lucentio loves:
795	And let me be a slave, to achieve that maid
796	Whose sudden sight hath thrall'd my wounded eye.
797	Here comes the rogue.
798	
799	[Enter BIONDELLO]
800	
801	Sirrah, where have you been?
802	
803	BIONDELLO	Where have I been! Nay, how now! where are you?
804	Master, has my fellow Tranio stolen your clothes? Or
805	you stolen his? or both? pray, what's the news?
806	
807	LUCENTIO	Sirrah, come hither: 'tis no time to jest,
808	And therefore frame your manners to the time.
809	Your fellow Tranio here, to save my life,
810	Puts my apparel and my countenance on,
811	And I for my escape have put on his;
812	For in a quarrel since I came ashore
813	I kill'd a man and fear I was descried:
814	Wait you on him, I charge you, as becomes,
815	While I make way from hence to save my life:
816	You understand me?
817	
818	BIONDELLO	                  I, sir! ne'er a whit.
819	
820	LUCENTIO	And not a jot of Tranio in your mouth:
821	Tranio is changed into Lucentio.
822	
823	BIONDELLO	The better for him: would I were so too!
824	
825	TRANIO	So could I, faith, boy, to have the next wish after,
826	That Lucentio indeed had Baptista's youngest daughter.
827	But, sirrah, not for my sake, but your master's, I advise
828	You use your manners discreetly in all kind of companies:
829	When I am alone, why, then I am Tranio;
830	But in all places else your master Lucentio.
831	
832	LUCENTIO	Tranio, let's go: one thing more rests, that
833	thyself execute, to make one among these wooers: if
834	thou ask me why, sufficeth, my reasons are both good
835	and weighty.
836	
837	[Exeunt]
838	
839	[The presenters above speak]
840	
841	First Servant	My lord, you nod; you do not mind the play.
842	
843	SLY	Yes, by Saint Anne, do I. A good matter, surely:
844	comes there any more of it?
845	
846	Page	My lord, 'tis but begun.
847	
848	SLY	'Tis a very excellent piece of work, madam lady:
849	would 'twere done!
850	
851	[They sit and mark]
852	
853	
854	
855	
856	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
857	
858	
859	ACT I
860	
861	
862	
863	SCENE II	Padua. Before HORTENSIO'S house.
864	
865	
866	[Enter PETRUCHIO and his man GRUMIO]
867	
868	PETRUCHIO	Verona, for a while I take my leave,
869	To see my friends in Padua, but of all
870	My best beloved and approved friend,
871	Hortensio; and I trow this is his house.
872	Here, sirrah Grumio; knock, I say.
873	
874	GRUMIO	Knock, sir! whom should I knock? is there man has
875	rebused your worship?
876	
877	PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me here soundly.
878	
879	GRUMIO	Knock you here, sir! why, sir, what am I, sir, that
880	I should knock you here, sir?
881	
882	PETRUCHIO	Villain, I say, knock me at this gate
883	And rap me well, or I'll knock your knave's pate.
884	
885	GRUMIO	My master is grown quarrelsome. I should knock
886	you first,
887	And then I know after who comes by the worst.
888	
889	PETRUCHIO	Will it not be?
890	Faith, sirrah, an you'll not knock, I'll ring it;
891	I'll try how you can sol, fa, and sing it.
892	
893	[He wrings him by the ears]
894	
895	GRUMIO	Help, masters, help! my master is mad.
896	
897	PETRUCHIO	Now, knock when I bid you, sirrah villain!
898	
899	[Enter HORTENSIO]
900	
901	HORTENSIO	How now! what's the matter? My old friend Grumio!
902	and my good friend Petruchio! How do you all at Verona?
903	
904	PETRUCHIO	Signior Hortensio, come you to part the fray?
905	'Con tutto il cuore, ben trovato,' may I say.
906	
907	HORTENSIO	'Alla nostra casa ben venuto, molto honorato signor
908	mio Petruchio.' Rise, Grumio, rise: we will compound
909	this quarrel.
910	
911	GRUMIO	Nay, 'tis no matter, sir, what he 'leges in Latin.
912	if this be not a lawful case for me to leave his
913	service, look you, sir, he bid me knock him and rap
914	him soundly, sir: well, was it fit for a servant to
915	use his master so, being perhaps, for aught I see,
916	two and thirty, a pip out? Whom would to God I had
917	well knock'd at first, Then had not Grumio come by the worst.
918	
919	PETRUCHIO	A senseless villain! Good Hortensio,
920	I bade the rascal knock upon your gate
921	And could not get him for my heart to do it.
922	
923	GRUMIO	Knock at the gate! O heavens! Spake you not these
924	words plain, 'Sirrah, knock me here, rap me here,
925	knock me well, and knock me soundly'? And come you
926	now with, 'knocking at the gate'?
927	
928	PETRUCHIO	Sirrah, be gone, or talk not, I advise you.
929	
930	HORTENSIO	Petruchio, patience; I am Grumio's pledge:
931	Why, this's a heavy chance 'twixt him and you,
932	Your ancient, trusty, pleasant servant Grumio.
933	And tell me now, sweet friend, what happy gale
934	Blows you to Padua here from old Verona?
935	
936	PETRUCHIO	Such wind as scatters young men through the world,
937	To seek their fortunes farther than at home
938	Where small experience grows. But in a few,
939	Signior Hortensio, thus it stands with me:
940	Antonio, my father, is deceased;
941	And I have thrust myself into this maze,
942	Haply to wive and thrive as best I may:
943	Crowns in my purse I have and goods at home,
944	And so am come abroad to see the world.
945	
946	HORTENSIO	Petruchio, shall I then come roundly to thee
947	And wish thee to a shrewd ill-favour'd wife?
948	Thou'ldst thank me but a little for my counsel:
949	And yet I'll promise thee she shall be rich
950	And very rich: but thou'rt too much my friend,
951	And I'll not wish thee to her.
952	
953	PETRUCHIO	Signior Hortensio, 'twixt such friends as we
954	Few words suffice; and therefore, if thou know
955	One rich enough to be Petruchio's wife,
956	As wealth is burden of my wooing dance,
957	Be she as foul as was Florentius' love,
958	As old as Sibyl and as curst and shrewd
959	As Socrates' Xanthippe, or a worse,
960	She moves me not, or not removes, at least,
961	Affection's edge in me, were she as rough
962	As are the swelling Adriatic seas:
963	I come to wive it wealthily in Padua;
964	If wealthily, then happily in Padua.
965	
966	GRUMIO	Nay, look you, sir, he tells you flatly what his
967	mind is: Why give him gold enough and marry him to
968	a puppet or an aglet-baby; or an old trot with ne'er
969	a tooth in her head, though she have as many diseases
970	as two and fifty horses: why, nothing comes amiss,
971	so money comes withal.
972	
973	HORTENSIO	Petruchio, since we are stepp'd thus far in,
974	I will continue that I broach'd in jest.
975	I can, Petruchio, help thee to a wife
976	With wealth enough and young and beauteous,
977	Brought up as best becomes a gentlewoman:
978	Her only fault, and that is faults enough,
979	Is that she is intolerable curst
980	And shrewd and froward, so beyond all measure
981	That, were my state far worser than it is,
982	I would not wed her for a mine of gold.
983	
984	PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, peace! thou know'st not gold's effect:
985	Tell me her father's name and 'tis enough;
986	For I will board her, though she chide as loud
987	As thunder when the clouds in autumn crack.
988	
989	HORTENSIO	Her father is Baptista Minola,
990	An affable and courteous gentleman:
991	Her name is Katharina Minola,
992	Renown'd in Padua for her scolding tongue.
993	
994	PETRUCHIO	I know her father, though I know not her;
995	And he knew my deceased father well.
996	I will not sleep, Hortensio, till I see her;
997	And therefore let me be thus bold with you
998	To give you over at this first encounter,
999	Unless you will accompany me thither.
1000	
1001	GRUMIO	I pray you, sir, let him go while the humour lasts.
1002	O' my word, an she knew him as well as I do, she
1003	would think scolding would do little good upon him:
1004	she may perhaps call him half a score knaves or so:
1005	why, that's nothing; an he begin once, he'll rail in
1006	his rope-tricks. I'll tell you what sir, an she
1007	stand him but a little, he will throw a figure in
1008	her face and so disfigure her with it that she
1009	shall have no more eyes to see withal than a cat.
1010	You know him not, sir.
1011	
1012	HORTENSIO	Tarry, Petruchio, I must go with thee,
1013	For in Baptista's keep my treasure is:
1014	He hath the jewel of my life in hold,
1015	His youngest daughter, beautiful Binaca,
1016	And her withholds from me and other more,
1017	Suitors to her and rivals in my love,
1018	Supposing it a thing impossible,
1019	For those defects I have before rehearsed,
1020	That ever Katharina will be woo'd;
1021	Therefore this order hath Baptista ta'en,
1022	That none shall have access unto Bianca
1023	Till Katharina the curst have got a husband.
1024	
1025	GRUMIO	Katharina the curst!
1026	A title for a maid of all titles the worst.
1027	
1028	HORTENSIO	Now shall my friend Petruchio do me grace,
1029	And offer me disguised in sober robes
1030	To old Baptista as a schoolmaster
1031	Well seen in music, to instruct Bianca;
1032	That so I may, by this device, at least
1033	Have leave and leisure to make love to her
1034	And unsuspected court her by herself.
1035	
1036	GRUMIO	Here's no knavery! See, to beguile the old folks,
1037	how the young folks lay their heads together!
1038	
1039	[Enter GREMIO, and LUCENTIO disguised]
1040	
1041	Master, master, look about you: who goes there, ha?
1042	
1043	HORTENSIO	Peace, Grumio! it is the rival of my love.
1044	Petruchio, stand by a while.
1045	
1046	GRUMIO	A proper stripling and an amorous!
1047	
1048	GREMIO	O, very well; I have perused the note.
1049	Hark you, sir: I'll have them very fairly bound:
1050	All books of love, see that at any hand;
1051	And see you read no other lectures to her:
1052	You understand me: over and beside
1053	Signior Baptista's liberality,
1054	I'll mend it with a largess. Take your paper too,
1055	And let me have them very well perfumed
1056	For she is sweeter than perfume itself
1057	To whom they go to. What will you read to her?
1058	
1059	LUCENTIO	Whate'er I read to her, I'll plead for you
1060	As for my patron, stand you so assured,
1061	As firmly as yourself were still in place:
1062	Yea, and perhaps with more successful words
1063	Than you, unless you were a scholar, sir.
1064	
1065	GREMIO	O this learning, what a thing it is!
1066	
1067	GRUMIO	O this woodcock, what an ass it is!
1068	
1069	PETRUCHIO	Peace, sirrah!
1070	
1071	HORTENSIO	Grumio, mum! God save you, Signior Gremio.
1072	
1073	GREMIO	And you are well met, Signior Hortensio.
1074	Trow you whither I am going? To Baptista Minola.
1075	I promised to inquire carefully
1076	About a schoolmaster for the fair Bianca:
1077	And by good fortune I have lighted well
1078	On this young man, for learning and behavior
1079	Fit for her turn, well read in poetry
1080	And other books, good ones, I warrant ye.
1081	
1082	HORTENSIO	'Tis well; and I have met a gentleman
1083	Hath promised me to help me to another,
1084	A fine musician to instruct our mistress;
1085	So shall I no whit be behind in duty
1086	To fair Bianca, so beloved of me.
1087	
1088	GREMIO	Beloved of me; and that my deeds shall prove.
1089	
1090	GRUMIO	And that his bags shall prove.
1091	
1092	HORTENSIO	Gremio, 'tis now no time to vent our love:
1093	Listen to me, and if you speak me fair,
1094	I'll tell you news indifferent good for either.
1095	Here is a gentleman whom by chance I met,
1096	Upon agreement from us to his liking,
1097	Will undertake to woo curst Katharina,
1098	Yea, and to marry her, if her dowry please.
1099	
1100	GREMIO	So said, so done, is well.
1101	Hortensio, have you told him all her faults?
1102	
1103	PETRUCHIO	I know she is an irksome brawling scold:
1104	If that be all, masters, I hear no harm.
1105	
1106	GREMIO	No, say'st me so, friend? What countryman?
1107	
1108	PETRUCHIO	Born in Verona, old Antonio's son:
1109	My father dead, my fortune lives for me;
1110	And I do hope good days and long to see.
1111	
1112	GREMIO	O sir, such a life, with such a wife, were strange!
1113	But if you have a stomach, to't i' God's name:
1114	You shall have me assisting you in all.
1115	But will you woo this wild-cat?
1116	
1117	PETRUCHIO	Will I live?
1118	
1119	GRUMIO	Will he woo her? ay, or I'll hang her.
1120	
1121	PETRUCHIO	Why came I hither but to that intent?
1122	Think you a little din can daunt mine ears?
1123	Have I not in my time heard lions roar?
1124	Have I not heard the sea puff'd up with winds
1125	Rage like an angry boar chafed with sweat?
1126	Have I not heard great ordnance in the field,
1127	And heaven's artillery thunder in the skies?
1128	Have I not in a pitched battle heard
1129	Loud 'larums, neighing steeds, and trumpets' clang?
1130	And do you tell me of a woman's tongue,
1131	That gives not half so great a blow to hear
1132	As will a chestnut in a farmer's fire?
1133	Tush, tush! fear boys with bugs.
1134	
1135	GRUMIO	For he fears none.
1136	
1137	GREMIO	Hortensio, hark:
1138	This gentleman is happily arrived,
1139	My mind presumes, for his own good and ours.
1140	
1141	HORTENSIO	I promised we would be contributors
1142	And bear his charging of wooing, whatsoe'er.
1143	
1144	GREMIO	And so we will, provided that he win her.
1145	
1146	GRUMIO	I would I were as sure of a good dinner.
1147	
1148	[Enter TRANIO brave, and BIONDELLO]
1149	
1150	TRANIO	Gentlemen, God save you. If I may be bold,
1151	Tell me, I beseech you, which is the readiest way
1152	To the house of Signior Baptista Minola?
1153	
1154	BIONDELLO	He that has the two fair daughters: is't he you mean?
1155	
1156	TRANIO	Even he, Biondello.
1157	
1158	GREMIO	Hark you, sir; you mean not her to--
1159	
1160	TRANIO	Perhaps, him and her, sir: what have you to do?
1161	
1162	PETRUCHIO	Not her that chides, sir, at any hand, I pray.
1163	
1164	TRANIO	I love no chiders, sir. Biondello, let's away.
1165	
1166	LUCENTIO	Well begun, Tranio.
1167	
1168	HORTENSIO	Sir, a word ere you go;
1169	Are you a suitor to the maid you talk of, yea or no?
1170	
1171	TRANIO	And if I be, sir, is it any offence?
1172	
1173	GREMIO	No; if without more words you will get you hence.
1174	
1175	TRANIO	Why, sir, I pray, are not the streets as free
1176	For me as for you?
1177	
1178	GREMIO	                  But so is not she.
1179	
1180	TRANIO	For what reason, I beseech you?
1181	
1182	GREMIO	For this reason, if you'll know,
1183	That she's the choice love of Signior Gremio.
1184	
1185	HORTENSIO	That she's the chosen of Signior Hortensio.
1186	
1187	TRANIO	Softly, my masters! if you be gentlemen,
1188	Do me this right; hear me with patience.
1189	Baptista is a noble gentleman,
1190	To whom my father is not all unknown;
1191	And were his daughter fairer than she is,
1192	She may more suitors have and me for one.
1193	Fair Leda's daughter had a thousand wooers;
1194	Then well one more may fair Bianca have:
1195	And so she shall; Lucentio shall make one,
1196	Though Paris came in hope to speed alone.
1197	
1198	GREMIO	What! this gentleman will out-talk us all.
1199	
1200	LUCENTIO	Sir, give him head: I know he'll prove a jade.
1201	
1202	PETRUCHIO	Hortensio, to what end are all these words?
1203	
1204	HORTENSIO	Sir, let me be so bold as ask you,
1205	Did you yet ever see Baptista's daughter?
1206	
1207	TRANIO	No, sir; but hear I do that he hath two,
1208	The one as famous for a scolding tongue
1209	As is the other for beauteous modesty.
1210	
1211	PETRUCHIO	Sir, sir, the first's for me; let her go by.
1212	
1213	GREMIO	Yea, leave that labour to great Hercules;
1214	And let it be more than Alcides' twelve.
1215	
1216	PETRUCHIO	Sir, understand you this of me in sooth:
1217	The youngest daughter whom you hearken for
1218	Her father keeps from all access of suitors,
1219	And will not promise her to any man
1220	Until the elder sister first be wed:
1221	The younger then is free and not before.
1222	
1223	TRANIO	If it be so, sir, that you are the man
1224	Must stead us all and me amongst the rest,
1225	And if you break the ice and do this feat,
1226	Achieve the elder, set the younger free
1227	For our access, whose hap shall be to have her
1228	Will not so graceless be to be ingrate.
1229	
1230	HORTENSIO	Sir, you say well and well you do conceive;
1231	And since you do profess to be a suitor,
1232	You must, as we do, gratify this gentleman,
1233	To whom we all rest generally beholding.
1234	
1235	TRANIO	Sir, I shall not be slack: in sign whereof,
1236	Please ye we may contrive this afternoon,
1237	And quaff carouses to our mistress' health,
1238	And do as adversaries do in law,
1239	Strive mightily, but eat and drink as friends.
1240	
1241	
1242	GRUMIO	|
1243	|  O excellent motion! Fellows, let's be gone.
1244	BIONDELLO	|
1245	
1246	
1247	HORTENSIO	The motion's good indeed and be it so,
1248	Petruchio, I shall be your ben venuto.
1249	
1250	[Exeunt]

1255	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
1256	
1257	
1258	ACT II
1259	
1260	
1261	
1262	SCENE I	Padua. A room in BAPTISTA'S house.
1263	
1264	
1265	[Enter KATHARINA and BIANCA]
1266	
1267	BIANCA	Good sister, wrong me not, nor wrong yourself,
1268	To make a bondmaid and a slave of me;
1269	That I disdain: but for these other gawds,
1270	Unbind my hands, I'll pull them off myself,
1271	Yea, all my raiment, to my petticoat;
1272	Or what you will command me will I do,
1273	So well I know my duty to my elders.
1274	
1275	KATHARINA	Of all thy suitors, here I charge thee, tell
1276	Whom thou lovest best: see thou dissemble not.
1277	
1278	BIANCA	Believe me, sister, of all the men alive
1279	I never yet beheld that special face
1280	Which I could fancy more than any other.
1281	
1282	KATHARINA	Minion, thou liest. Is't not Hortensio?
1283	
1284	BIANCA	If you affect him, sister, here I swear
1285	I'll plead for you myself, but you shall have
1286	him.
1287	
1288	KATHARINA	O then, belike, you fancy riches more:
1289	You will have Gremio to keep you fair.
1290	
1291	BIANCA	Is it for him you do envy me so?
1292	Nay then you jest, and now I well perceive
1293	You have but jested with me all this while:
1294	I prithee, sister Kate, untie my hands.
1295	
1296	KATHARINA	If that be jest, then all the rest was so.
1297	
1298	[Strikes her]
1299	
1300	[Enter BAPTISTA]
1301	
1302	BAPTISTA	Why, how now, dame! whence grows this insolence?
1303	Bianca, stand aside. Poor girl! she weeps.
1304	Go ply thy needle; meddle not with her.
1305	For shame, thou helding of a devilish spirit,
1306	Why dost thou wrong her that did ne'er wrong thee?
1307	When did she cross thee with a bitter word?
1308	
1309	KATHARINA	Her silence flouts me, and I'll be revenged.
1310	
1311	[Flies after BIANCA]
1312	
1313	BAPTISTA	What, in my sight? Bianca, get thee in.
1314	
1315	[Exit BIANCA]
1316	
1317	KATHARINA	What, will you not suffer me? Nay, now I see
1318	She is your treasure, she must have a husband;
1319	I must dance bare-foot on her wedding day
1320	And for your love to her lead apes in hell.
1321	Talk not to me: I will go sit and weep
1322	Till I can find occasion of revenge.
1323	
1324	[Exit]
1325	
1326	BAPTISTA	Was ever gentleman thus grieved as I?
1327	But who comes here?
1328	
1329	[Enter GREMIO, LUCENTIO in the habit of a mean man;
1330	PETRUCHIO, with HORTENSIO as a musician; and TRANIO,
1331	with BIONDELLO bearing a lute and books]
1332	
1333	GREMIO	Good morrow, neighbour Baptista.
1334	
1335	BAPTISTA	Good morrow, neighbour Gremio.
1336	God save you, gentlemen!
1337	
1338	PETRUCHIO	And you, good sir! Pray, have you not a daughter
1339	Call'd Katharina, fair and virtuous?
1340	
1341	BAPTISTA	I have a daughter, sir, called Katharina.
1342	
1343	GREMIO	You are too blunt: go to it orderly.
1344	
1345	PETRUCHIO	You wrong me, Signior Gremio: give me leave.
1346	I am a gentleman of Verona, sir,
1347	That, hearing of her beauty and her wit,
1348	Her affability and bashful modesty,
1349	Her wondrous qualities and mild behavior,
1350	Am bold to show myself a forward guest
1351	Within your house, to make mine eye the witness
1352	Of that report which I so oft have heard.
1353	And, for an entrance to my entertainment,
1354	I do present you with a man of mine,
1355	
1356	[Presenting HORTENSIO]
1357	
1358	Cunning in music and the mathematics,
1359	To instruct her fully in those sciences,
1360	Whereof I know she is not ignorant:
1361	Accept of him, or else you do me wrong:
1362	His name is Licio, born in Mantua.
1363	
1364	BAPTISTA	You're welcome, sir; and he, for your good sake.
1365	But for my daughter Katharina, this I know,
1366	She is not for your turn, the more my grief.
1367	
1368	PETRUCHIO	I see you do not mean to part with her,
1369	Or else you like not of my company.
1370	
1371	BAPTISTA	Mistake me not; I speak but as I find.
1372	Whence are you, sir? what may I call your name?
1373	
1374	PETRUCHIO	Petruchio is my name; Antonio's son,
1375	A man well known throughout all Italy.
1376	
1377	BAPTISTA	I know him well: you are welcome for his sake.
1378	
1379	GREMIO	Saving your tale, Petruchio, I pray,
1380	Let us, that are poor petitioners, speak too:
1381	Baccare! you are marvellous forward.
1382	
1383	PETRUCHIO	O, pardon me, Signior Gremio; I would fain be doing.
1384	
1385	GREMIO	I doubt it not, sir; but you will curse your
1386	wooing. Neighbour, this is a gift very grateful, I am
1387	sure of it. To express the like kindness, myself,
1388	that have been more kindly beholding to you than
1389	any, freely give unto you this young scholar,
1390	
1391	[Presenting LUCENTIO]
1392	
1393	that hath been long studying at Rheims; as cunning
1394	in Greek, Latin, and other languages, as the other
1395	in music and mathematics: his name is Cambio; pray,
1396	accept his service.
1397	
1398	BAPTISTA	A thousand thanks, Signior Gremio.
1399	Welcome, good Cambio.
1400	
1401	[To TRANIO]
1402	
1403	But, gentle sir, methinks you walk like a stranger:
1404	may I be so bold to know the cause of your coming?
1405	
1406	TRANIO	Pardon me, sir, the boldness is mine own,
1407	That, being a stranger in this city here,
1408	Do make myself a suitor to your daughter,
1409	Unto Bianca, fair and virtuous.
1410	Nor is your firm resolve unknown to me,
1411	In the preferment of the eldest sister.
1412	This liberty is all that I request,
1413	That, upon knowledge of my parentage,
1414	I may have welcome 'mongst the rest that woo
1415	And free access and favour as the rest:
1416	And, toward the education of your daughters,
1417	I here bestow a simple instrument,
1418	And this small packet of Greek and Latin books:
1419	If you accept them, then their worth is great.
1420	
1421	BAPTISTA	Lucentio is your name; of whence, I pray?
1422	
1423	TRANIO	Of Pisa, sir; son to Vincentio.
1424	
1425	BAPTISTA	A mighty man of Pisa; by report
1426	I know him well: you are very welcome, sir,
1427	Take you the lute, and you the set of books;
1428	You shall go see your pupils presently.
1429	Holla, within!
1430	
1431	[Enter a Servant]
1432	
1433	Sirrah, lead these gentlemen
1434	To my daughters; and tell them both,
1435	These are their tutors: bid them use them well.
1436	
1437	[Exit Servant, with LUCENTIO and HORTENSIO,
1438	BIONDELLO following]
1439	
1440	We will go walk a little in the orchard,
1441	And then to dinner. You are passing welcome,
1442	And so I pray you all to think yourselves.
1443	
1444	PETRUCHIO	Signior Baptista, my business asketh haste,
1445	And every day I cannot come to woo.
1446	You knew my father well, and in him me,
1447	Left solely heir to all his lands and goods,
1448	Which I have better'd rather than decreased:
1449	Then tell me, if I get your daughter's love,
1450	What dowry shall I have with her to wife?
1451	
1452	BAPTISTA	After my death the one half of my lands,
1453	And in possession twenty thousand crowns.
1454	
1455	PETRUCHIO	And, for that dowry, I'll assure her of
1456	Her widowhood, be it that she survive me,
1457	In all my lands and leases whatsoever:
1458	Let specialties be therefore drawn between us,
1459	That covenants may be kept on either hand.
1460	
1461	BAPTISTA	Ay, when the special thing is well obtain'd,
1462	That is, her love; for that is all in all.
1463	
1464	PETRUCHIO	Why, that is nothing: for I tell you, father,
1465	I am as peremptory as she proud-minded;
1466	And where two raging fires meet together
1467	They do consume the thing that feeds their fury:
1468	Though little fire grows great with little wind,
1469	Yet extreme gusts will blow out fire and all:
1470	So I to her and so she yields to me;
1471	For I am rough and woo not like a babe.
1472	
1473	BAPTISTA	Well mayst thou woo, and happy be thy speed!
1474	But be thou arm'd for some unhappy words.
1475	
1476	PETRUCHIO	Ay, to the proof; as mountains are for winds,
1477	That shake not, though they blow perpetually.
1478	
1479	[Re-enter HORTENSIO, with his head broke]
1480	
1481	BAPTISTA	How now, my friend! why dost thou look so pale?
1482	
1483	HORTENSIO	For fear, I promise you, if I look pale.
1484	
1485	BAPTISTA	What, will my daughter prove a good musician?
1486	
1487	HORTENSIO	I think she'll sooner prove a soldier
1488	Iron may hold with her, but never lutes.
1489	
1490	BAPTISTA	Why, then thou canst not break her to the lute?
1491	
1492	HORTENSIO	Why, no; for she hath broke the lute to me.
1493	I did but tell her she mistook her frets,
1494	And bow'd her hand to teach her fingering;
1495	When, with a most impatient devilish spirit,
1496	'Frets, call you these?' quoth she; 'I'll fume
1497	with them:'
1498	And, with that word, she struck me on the head,
1499	And through the instrument my pate made way;
1500	And there I stood amazed for a while,
1501	As on a pillory, looking through the lute;
1502	While she did call me rascal fiddler
1503	And twangling Jack; with twenty such vile terms,
1504	As had she studied to misuse me so.
1505	
1506	PETRUCHIO	Now, by the world, it is a lusty wench;
1507	I love her ten times more than e'er I did:
1508	O, how I long to have some chat with her!
1509	
1510	BAPTISTA	Well, go with me and be not so discomfited:
1511	Proceed in practise with my younger daughter;
1512	She's apt to learn and thankful for good turns.
1513	Signior Petruchio, will you go with us,
1514	Or shall I send my daughter Kate to you?
1515	
1516	PETRUCHIO	I pray you do.
1517	
1518	[Exeunt all but PETRUCHIO]
1519	
1520	I will attend her here,
1521	And woo her with some spirit when she comes.
1522	Say that she rail; why then I'll tell her plain
1523	She sings as sweetly as a nightingale:
1524	Say that she frown, I'll say she looks as clear
1525	As morning roses newly wash'd with dew:
1526	Say she be mute and will not speak a word;
1527	Then I'll commend her volubility,
1528	And say she uttereth piercing eloquence:
1529	If she do bid me pack, I'll give her thanks,
1530	As though she bid me stay by her a week:
1531	If she deny to wed, I'll crave the day
1532	When I shall ask the banns and when be married.
1533	But here she comes; and now, Petruchio, speak.
1534	
1535	[Enter KATHARINA]
1536	
1537	Good morrow, Kate; for that's your name, I hear.
1538	
1539	KATHARINA	Well have you heard, but something hard of hearing:
1540	They call me Katharina that do talk of me.
1541	
1542	PETRUCHIO	You lie, in faith; for you are call'd plain Kate,
1543	And bonny Kate and sometimes Kate the curst;
1544	But Kate, the prettiest Kate in Christendom
1545	Kate of Kate Hall, my super-dainty Kate,
1546	For dainties are all Kates, and therefore, Kate,
1547	Take this of me, Kate of my consolation;
1548	Hearing thy mildness praised in every town,
1549	Thy virtues spoke of, and thy beauty sounded,
1550	Yet not so deeply as to thee belongs,
1551	Myself am moved to woo thee for my wife.
1552	
1553	KATHARINA	Moved! in good time: let him that moved you hither
1554	Remove you hence: I knew you at the first
1555	You were a moveable.
1556	
1557	PETRUCHIO	Why, what's a moveable?
1558	
1559	KATHARINA	A join'd-stool.
1560	
1561	PETRUCHIO	Thou hast hit it: come, sit on me.
1562	
1563	KATHARINA	Asses are made to bear, and so are you.
1564	
1565	PETRUCHIO	Women are made to bear, and so are you.
1566	
1567	KATHARINA	No such jade as you, if me you mean.
1568	
1569	PETRUCHIO	Alas! good Kate, I will not burden thee;
1570	For, knowing thee to be but young and light--
1571	
1572	KATHARINA	Too light for such a swain as you to catch;
1573	And yet as heavy as my weight should be.
1574	
1575	PETRUCHIO	Should be! should--buzz!
1576	
1577	KATHARINA	Well ta'en, and like a buzzard.
1578	
1579	PETRUCHIO	O slow-wing'd turtle! shall a buzzard take thee?
1580	
1581	KATHARINA	Ay, for a turtle, as he takes a buzzard.
1582	
1583	PETRUCHIO	Come, come, you wasp; i' faith, you are too angry.
1584	
1585	KATHARINA	If I be waspish, best beware my sting.
1586	
1587	PETRUCHIO	My remedy is then, to pluck it out.
1588	
1589	KATHARINA	Ay, if the fool could find it where it lies,
1590	
1591	PETRUCHIO	Who knows not where a wasp does
1592	wear his sting? In his tail.
1593	
1594	KATHARINA	In his tongue.
1595	
1596	PETRUCHIO	Whose tongue?
1597	
1598	KATHARINA	Yours, if you talk of tails: and so farewell.
1599	
1600	PETRUCHIO	What, with my tongue in your tail? nay, come again,
1601	Good Kate; I am a gentleman.
1602	
1603	KATHARINA	That I'll try.
1604	
1605	[She strikes him]
1606	
1607	PETRUCHIO	I swear I'll cuff you, if you strike again.
1608	
1609	KATHARINA	So may you lose your arms:
1610	If you strike me, you are no gentleman;
1611	And if no gentleman, why then no arms.
1612	
1613	PETRUCHIO	A herald, Kate? O, put me in thy books!
1614	
1615	KATHARINA	What is your crest? a coxcomb?
1616	
1617	PETRUCHIO	A combless cock, so Kate will be my hen.
1618	
1619	KATHARINA	No cock of mine; you crow too like a craven.
1620	
1621	PETRUCHIO	Nay, come, Kate, come; you must not look so sour.
1622	
1623	KATHARINA	It is my fashion, when I see a crab.
1624	
1625	PETRUCHIO	Why, here's no crab; and therefore look not sour.
1626	
1627	KATHARINA	There is, there is.
1628	
1629	PETRUCHIO	Then show it me.
1630	
1631	KATHARINA	Had I a glass, I would.
1632	
1633	PETRUCHIO	What, you mean my face?
1634	
1635	KATHARINA	Well aim'd of such a young one.
1636	
1637	PETRUCHIO	Now, by Saint George, I am too young for you.
1638	
1639	KATHARINA	Yet you are wither'd.
1640	
1641	PETRUCHIO	'Tis with cares.
1642	
1643	KATHARINA	I care not.
1644	
1645	PETRUCHIO	Nay, hear you, Kate: in sooth you scape not so.
1646	
1647	KATHARINA	I chafe you, if I tarry: let me go.
1648	
1649	PETRUCHIO	No, not a whit: I find you passing gentle.
1650	'Twas told me you were rough and coy and sullen,
1651	And now I find report a very liar;
1652	For thou are pleasant, gamesome, passing courteous,
1653	But slow in speech, yet sweet as spring-time flowers:
1654	Thou canst not frown, thou canst not look askance,
1655	Nor bite the lip, as angry wenches will,
1656	Nor hast thou pleasure to be cross in talk,
1657	But thou with mildness entertain'st thy wooers,
1658	With gentle conference, soft and affable.
1659	Why does the world report that Kate doth limp?
1660	O slanderous world! Kate like the hazel-twig
1661	Is straight and slender and as brown in hue
1662	As hazel nuts and sweeter than the kernels.
1663	O, let me see thee walk: thou dost not halt.
1664	
1665	KATHARINA	Go, fool, and whom thou keep'st command.
1666	
1667	PETRUCHIO	Did ever Dian so become a grove
1668	As Kate this chamber with her princely gait?
1669	O, be thou Dian, and let her be Kate;
1670	And then let Kate be chaste and Dian sportful!
1671	
1672	KATHARINA	Where did you study all this goodly speech?
1673	
1674	PETRUCHIO	It is extempore, from my mother-wit.
1675	
1676	KATHARINA	A witty mother! witless else her son.
1677	
1678	PETRUCHIO	Am I not wise?
1679	
1680	KATHARINA	Yes; keep you warm.
1681	
1682	PETRUCHIO	Marry, so I mean, sweet Katharina, in thy bed:
1683	And therefore, setting all this chat aside,
1684	Thus in plain terms: your father hath consented
1685	That you shall be my wife; your dowry 'greed on;
1686	And, Will you, nill you, I will marry you.
1687	Now, Kate, I am a husband for your turn;
1688	For, by this light, whereby I see thy beauty,
1689	Thy beauty, that doth make me like thee well,
1690	Thou must be married to no man but me;
1691	For I am he am born to tame you Kate,
1692	And bring you from a wild Kate to a Kate
1693	Conformable as other household Kates.
1694	Here comes your father: never make denial;
1695	I must and will have Katharina to my wife.
1696	
1697	[Re-enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and TRANIO]
1698	
1699	BAPTISTA	Now, Signior Petruchio, how speed you with my daughter?
1700	
1701	PETRUCHIO	How but well, sir? how but well?
1702	It were impossible I should speed amiss.
1703	
1704	BAPTISTA	Why, how now, daughter Katharina! in your dumps?
1705	
1706	KATHARINA	Call you me daughter? now, I promise you
1707	You have show'd a tender fatherly regard,
1708	To wish me wed to one half lunatic;
1709	A mad-cup ruffian and a swearing Jack,
1710	That thinks with oaths to face the matter out.
1711	
1712	PETRUCHIO	Father, 'tis thus: yourself and all the world,
1713	That talk'd of her, have talk'd amiss of her:
1714	If she be curst, it is for policy,
1715	For she's not froward, but modest as the dove;
1716	She is not hot, but temperate as the morn;
1717	For patience she will prove a second Grissel,
1718	And Roman Lucrece for her chastity:
1719	And to conclude, we have 'greed so well together,
1720	That upon Sunday is the wedding-day.
1721	
1722	KATHARINA	I'll see thee hang'd on Sunday first.
1723	
1724	GREMIO	Hark, Petruchio; she says she'll see thee
1725	hang'd first.
1726	
1727	TRANIO	Is this your speeding? nay, then, good night our part!
1728	
1729	PETRUCHIO	Be patient, gentlemen; I choose her for myself:
1730	If she and I be pleased, what's that to you?
1731	'Tis bargain'd 'twixt us twain, being alone,
1732	That she shall still be curst in company.
1733	I tell you, 'tis incredible to believe
1734	How much she loves me: O, the kindest Kate!
1735	She hung about my neck; and kiss on kiss
1736	She vied so fast, protesting oath on oath,
1737	That in a twink she won me to her love.
1738	O, you are novices! 'tis a world to see,
1739	How tame, when men and women are alone,
1740	A meacock wretch can make the curstest shrew.
1741	Give me thy hand, Kate: I will unto Venice,
1742	To buy apparel 'gainst the wedding-day.
1743	Provide the feast, father, and bid the guests;
1744	I will be sure my Katharina shall be fine.
1745	
1746	BAPTISTA	I know not what to say: but give me your hands;
1747	God send you joy, Petruchio! 'tis a match.
1748	
1749	
1750	GREMIO	|
1751	|  Amen, say we: we will be witnesses.
1752	TRANIO	|
1753	
1754	
1755	PETRUCHIO	Father, and wife, and gentlemen, adieu;
1756	I will to Venice; Sunday comes apace:
1757	We will have rings and things and fine array;
1758	And kiss me, Kate, we will be married o'Sunday.
1759	
1760	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA severally]
1761	
1762	GREMIO	Was ever match clapp'd up so suddenly?
1763	
1764	BAPTISTA	Faith, gentlemen, now I play a merchant's part,
1765	And venture madly on a desperate mart.
1766	
1767	TRANIO	'Twas a commodity lay fretting by you:
1768	'Twill bring you gain, or perish on the seas.
1769	
1770	BAPTISTA	The gain I seek is, quiet in the match.
1771	
1772	GREMIO	No doubt but he hath got a quiet catch.
1773	But now, Baptists, to your younger daughter:
1774	Now is the day we long have looked for:
1775	I am your neighbour, and was suitor first.
1776	
1777	TRANIO	And I am one that love Bianca more
1778	Than words can witness, or your thoughts can guess.
1779	
1780	GREMIO	Youngling, thou canst not love so dear as I.
1781	
1782	TRANIO	Graybeard, thy love doth freeze.
1783	
1784	GREMIO	But thine doth fry.
1785	Skipper, stand back: 'tis age that nourisheth.
1786	
1787	TRANIO	But youth in ladies' eyes that flourisheth.
1788	
1789	BAPTISTA	Content you, gentlemen: I will compound this strife:
1790	'Tis deeds must win the prize; and he of both
1791	That can assure my daughter greatest dower
1792	Shall have my Bianca's love.
1793	Say, Signior Gremio, What can you assure her?
1794	
1795	GREMIO	First, as you know, my house within the city
1796	Is richly furnished with plate and gold;
1797	Basins and ewers to lave her dainty hands;
1798	My hangings all of Tyrian tapestry;
1799	In ivory coffers I have stuff'd my crowns;
1800	In cypress chests my arras counterpoints,
1801	Costly apparel, tents, and canopies,
1802	Fine linen, Turkey cushions boss'd with pearl,
1803	Valance of Venice gold in needlework,
1804	Pewter and brass and all things that belong
1805	To house or housekeeping: then, at my farm
1806	I have a hundred milch-kine to the pail,
1807	Sixscore fat oxen standing in my stalls,
1808	And all things answerable to this portion.
1809	Myself am struck in years, I must confess;
1810	And if I die to-morrow, this is hers,
1811	If whilst I live she will be only mine.
1812	
1813	TRANIO	That 'only' came well in. Sir, list to me:
1814	I am my father's heir and only son:
1815	If I may have your daughter to my wife,
1816	I'll leave her houses three or four as good,
1817	Within rich Pisa walls, as any one
1818	Old Signior Gremio has in Padua;
1819	Besides two thousand ducats by the year
1820	Of fruitful land, all which shall be her jointure.
1821	What, have I pinch'd you, Signior Gremio?
1822	
1823	GREMIO	Two thousand ducats by the year of land!
1824	My land amounts not to so much in all:
1825	That she shall have; besides an argosy
1826	That now is lying in Marseilles' road.
1827	What, have I choked you with an argosy?
1828	
1829	TRANIO	Gremio, 'tis known my father hath no less
1830	Than three great argosies; besides two galliases,
1831	And twelve tight galleys: these I will assure her,
1832	And twice as much, whate'er thou offer'st next.
1833	
1834	GREMIO	Nay, I have offer'd all, I have no more;
1835	And she can have no more than all I have:
1836	If you like me, she shall have me and mine.
1837	
1838	TRANIO	Why, then the maid is mine from all the world,
1839	By your firm promise: Gremio is out-vied.
1840	
1841	BAPTISTA	I must confess your offer is the best;
1842	And, let your father make her the assurance,
1843	She is your own; else, you must pardon me,
1844	if you should die before him, where's her dower?
1845	
1846	TRANIO	That's but a cavil: he is old, I young.
1847	
1848	GREMIO	And may not young men die, as well as old?
1849	
1850	BAPTISTA	Well, gentlemen,
1851	I am thus resolved: on Sunday next you know
1852	My daughter Katharina is to be married:
1853	Now, on the Sunday following, shall Bianca
1854	Be bride to you, if you this assurance;
1855	If not, Signior Gremio:
1856	And so, I take my leave, and thank you both.
1857	
1858	GREMIO	Adieu, good neighbour.
1859	
1860	[Exit BAPTISTA]
1861	
1862	Now I fear thee not:
1863	Sirrah young gamester, your father were a fool
1864	To give thee all, and in his waning age
1865	Set foot under thy table: tut, a toy!
1866	An old Italian fox is not so kind, my boy.
1867	
1868	[Exit]
1869	
1870	TRANIO	A vengeance on your crafty wither'd hide!
1871	Yet I have faced it with a card of ten.
1872	'Tis in my head to do my master good:
1873	I see no reason but supposed Lucentio
1874	Must get a father, call'd 'supposed Vincentio;'
1875	And that's a wonder: fathers commonly
1876	Do get their children; but in this case of wooing,
1877	A child shall get a sire, if I fail not of my cunning.

1886	
1887	ACT III
1888	
1889	
1890	
1891	SCENE I	Padua. BAPTISTA'S house.
1892	
1893	
1894	[Enter LUCENTIO, HORTENSIO, and BIANCA]
1895	
1896	LUCENTIO	Fiddler, forbear; you grow too forward, sir:
1897	Have you so soon forgot the entertainment
1898	Her sister Katharina welcomed you withal?
1899	
1900	HORTENSIO	But, wrangling pedant, this is
1901	The patroness of heavenly harmony:
1902	Then give me leave to have prerogative;
1903	And when in music we have spent an hour,
1904	Your lecture shall have leisure for as much.
1905	
1906	LUCENTIO	Preposterous ass, that never read so far
1907	To know the cause why music was ordain'd!
1908	Was it not to refresh the mind of man
1909	After his studies or his usual pain?
1910	Then give me leave to read philosophy,
1911	And while I pause, serve in your harmony.
1912	
1913	HORTENSIO	Sirrah, I will not bear these braves of thine.
1914	
1915	BIANCA	Why, gentlemen, you do me double wrong,
1916	To strive for that which resteth in my choice:
1917	I am no breeching scholar in the schools;
1918	I'll not be tied to hours nor 'pointed times,
1919	But learn my lessons as I please myself.
1920	And, to cut off all strife, here sit we down:
1921	Take you your instrument, play you the whiles;
1922	His lecture will be done ere you have tuned.
1923	
1924	HORTENSIO	You'll leave his lecture when I am in tune?
1925	
1926	LUCENTIO	That will be never: tune your instrument.
1927	
1928	BIANCA	Where left we last?
1929	
1930	LUCENTIO	Here, madam:
1931	'Hic ibat Simois; hic est Sigeia tellus;
1932	Hic steterat Priami regia celsa senis.'
1933	
1934	BIANCA	Construe them.
1935	
1936	LUCENTIO	'Hic ibat,' as I told you before, 'Simois,' I am
1937	Lucentio, 'hic est,' son unto Vincentio of Pisa,
1938	'Sigeia tellus,' disguised thus to get your love;
1939	'Hic steterat,' and that Lucentio that comes
1940	a-wooing, 'Priami,' is my man Tranio, 'regia,'
1941	bearing my port, 'celsa senis,' that we might
1942	beguile the old pantaloon.
1943	
1944	HORTENSIO	Madam, my instrument's in tune.
1945	
1946	BIANCA	Let's hear. O fie! the treble jars.
1947	
1948	LUCENTIO	Spit in the hole, man, and tune again.
1949	
1950	BIANCA	Now let me see if I can construe it: 'Hic ibat
1951	Simois,' I know you not, 'hic est Sigeia tellus,' I
1952	trust you not; 'Hic steterat Priami,' take heed
1953	he hear us not, 'regia,' presume not, 'celsa senis,'
1954	despair not.
1955	
1956	HORTENSIO	Madam, 'tis now in tune.
1957	
1958	LUCENTIO	All but the base.
1959	
1960	HORTENSIO	The base is right; 'tis the base knave that jars.
1961	
1962	[Aside]
1963	
1964	How fiery and forward our pedant is!
1965	Now, for my life, the knave doth court my love:
1966	Pedascule, I'll watch you better yet.
1967	
1968	BIANCA	In time I may believe, yet I mistrust.
1969	
1970	LUCENTIO	Mistrust it not: for, sure, AEacides
1971	Was Ajax, call'd so from his grandfather.
1972	
1973	BIANCA	I must believe my master; else, I promise you,
1974	I should be arguing still upon that doubt:
1975	But let it rest. Now, Licio, to you:
1976	Good masters, take it not unkindly, pray,
1977	That I have been thus pleasant with you both.
1978	
1979	HORTENSIO	You may go walk, and give me leave a while:
1980	My lessons make no music in three parts.
1981	
1982	LUCENTIO	Are you so formal, sir? well, I must wait,
1983	
1984	[Aside]
1985	
1986	And watch withal; for, but I be deceived,
1987	Our fine musician groweth amorous.
1988	
1989	HORTENSIO	Madam, before you touch the instrument,
1990	To learn the order of my fingering,
1991	I must begin with rudiments of art;
1992	To teach you gamut in a briefer sort,
1993	More pleasant, pithy and effectual,
1994	Than hath been taught by any of my trade:
1995	And there it is in writing, fairly drawn.
1996	
1997	BIANCA	Why, I am past my gamut long ago.
1998	
1999	HORTENSIO	Yet read the gamut of Hortensio.
2000	
2001	BIANCA	[Reads]  ''Gamut' I am, the ground of all accord,
2002	'A re,' to Plead Hortensio's passion;
2003	'B mi,' Bianca, take him for thy lord,
2004	'C fa ut,' that loves with all affection:
2005	'D sol re,' one clef, two notes have I:
2006	'E la mi,' show pity, or I die.'
2007	Call you this gamut? tut, I like it not:
2008	Old fashions please me best; I am not so nice,
2009	To change true rules for old inventions.
2010	
2011	[Enter a Servant]
2012	
2013	Servant	Mistress, your father prays you leave your books
2014	And help to dress your sister's chamber up:
2015	You know to-morrow is the wedding-day.
2016	
2017	BIANCA	Farewell, sweet masters both; I must be gone.
2018	
2019	[Exeunt BIANCA and Servant]
2020	
2021	LUCENTIO	Faith, mistress, then I have no cause to stay.
2022	
2023	[Exit]
2024	
2025	HORTENSIO	But I have cause to pry into this pedant:
2026	Methinks he looks as though he were in love:
2027	Yet if thy thoughts, Bianca, be so humble
2028	To cast thy wandering eyes on every stale,
2029	Seize thee that list: if once I find thee ranging,
2030	Hortensio will be quit with thee by changing.
2031	
2032	[Exit]

2039	
2040	ACT III
2041	
2042	
2043	
2044	SCENE II	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
2045	
2046	
2047	[Enter BAPTISTA, GREMIO, TRANIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA,
2048	LUCENTIO, and others, attendants]
2049	
2050	BAPTISTA	[To TRANIO]  Signior Lucentio, this is the
2051	'pointed day.
2052	That Katharina and Petruchio should be married,
2053	And yet we hear not of our son-in-law.
2054	What will be said? what mockery will it be,
2055	To want the bridegroom when the priest attends
2056	To speak the ceremonial rites of marriage!
2057	What says Lucentio to this shame of ours?
2058	
2059	KATHARINA	No shame but mine: I must, forsooth, be forced
2060	To give my hand opposed against my heart
2061	Unto a mad-brain rudesby full of spleen;
2062	Who woo'd in haste and means to wed at leisure.
2063	I told you, I, he was a frantic fool,
2064	Hiding his bitter jests in blunt behavior:
2065	And, to be noted for a merry man,
2066	He'll woo a thousand, 'point the day of marriage,
2067	Make feasts, invite friends, and proclaim the banns;
2068	Yet never means to wed where he hath woo'd.
2069	Now must the world point at poor Katharina,
2070	And say, 'Lo, there is mad Petruchio's wife,
2071	If it would please him come and marry her!'
2072	
2073	TRANIO	Patience, good Katharina, and Baptista too.
2074	Upon my life, Petruchio means but well,
2075	Whatever fortune stays him from his word:
2076	Though he be blunt, I know him passing wise;
2077	Though he be merry, yet withal he's honest.
2078	
2079	KATHARINA	Would Katharina had never seen him though!
2080	
2081	[Exit weeping, followed by BIANCA and others]
2082	
2083	BAPTISTA	Go, girl; I cannot blame thee now to weep;
2084	For such an injury would vex a very saint,
2085	Much more a shrew of thy impatient humour.
2086	
2087	[Enter BIONDELLO]
2088	
2089	BIONDELLO	Master, master! news, old news, and such news as
2090	you never heard of!
2091	
2092	BAPTISTA	Is it new and old too? how may that be?
2093	
2094	BIONDELLO	Why, is it not news, to hear of Petruchio's coming?
2095	
2096	BAPTISTA	Is he come?
2097	
2098	BIONDELLO	Why, no, sir.
2099	
2100	BAPTISTA	What then?
2101	
2102	BIONDELLO	He is coming.
2103	
2104	BAPTISTA	When will he be here?
2105	
2106	BIONDELLO	When he stands where I am and sees you there.
2107	
2108	TRANIO	But say, what to thine old news?
2109	
2110	BIONDELLO	Why, Petruchio is coming in a new hat and an old
2111	jerkin, a pair of old breeches thrice turned, a pair
2112	of boots that have been candle-cases, one buckled,
2113	another laced, an old rusty sword ta'en out of the
2114	town-armory, with a broken hilt, and chapeless;
2115	with two broken points: his horse hipped with an
2116	old mothy saddle and stirrups of no kindred;
2117	besides, possessed with the glanders and like to mose
2118	in the chine; troubled with the lampass, infected
2119	with the fashions, full of wingdalls, sped with
2120	spavins, rayed with yellows, past cure of the fives,
2121	stark spoiled with the staggers, begnawn with the
2122	bots, swayed in the back and shoulder-shotten;
2123	near-legged before and with, a half-chequed bit
2124	and a head-stall of sheeps leather which, being
2125	restrained to keep him from stumbling, hath been
2126	often burst and now repaired with knots; one girth
2127	six time pieced and a woman's crupper of velure,
2128	which hath two letters for her name fairly set down
2129	in studs, and here and there pieced with packthread.
2130	
2131	BAPTISTA	Who comes with him?
2132	
2133	BIONDELLO	O, sir, his lackey, for all the world caparisoned
2134	like the horse; with a linen stock on one leg and a
2135	kersey boot-hose on the other, gartered with a red
2136	and blue list; an old hat and 'the humour of forty
2137	fancies' pricked in't for a feather: a monster, a
2138	very monster in apparel, and not like a Christian
2139	footboy or a gentleman's lackey.
2140	
2141	TRANIO	'Tis some odd humour pricks him to this fashion;
2142	Yet oftentimes he goes but mean-apparell'd.
2143	
2144	BAPTISTA	I am glad he's come, howsoe'er he comes.
2145	
2146	BIONDELLO	Why, sir, he comes not.
2147	
2148	BAPTISTA	Didst thou not say he comes?
2149	
2150	BIONDELLO	Who? that Petruchio came?
2151	
2152	BAPTISTA	Ay, that Petruchio came.
2153	
2154	BIONDELLO	No, sir, I say his horse comes, with him on his back.
2155	
2156	BAPTISTA	Why, that's all one.
2157	
2158	BIONDELLO	   Nay, by Saint Jamy,
2159	I hold you a penny,
2160	A horse and a man
2161	Is more than one,
2162	And yet not many.
2163	
2164	[Enter PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO]
2165	
2166	PETRUCHIO	Come, where be these gallants? who's at home?
2167	
2168	BAPTISTA	You are welcome, sir.
2169	
2170	PETRUCHIO	And yet I come not well.
2171	
2172	BAPTISTA	And yet you halt not.
2173	
2174	TRANIO	Not so well apparell'd
2175	As I wish you were.
2176	
2177	PETRUCHIO	Were it better, I should rush in thus.
2178	But where is Kate? where is my lovely bride?
2179	How does my father? Gentles, methinks you frown:
2180	And wherefore gaze this goodly company,
2181	As if they saw some wondrous monument,
2182	Some comet or unusual prodigy?
2183	
2184	BAPTISTA	Why, sir, you know this is your wedding-day:
2185	First were we sad, fearing you would not come;
2186	Now sadder, that you come so unprovided.
2187	Fie, doff this habit, shame to your estate,
2188	An eye-sore to our solemn festival!
2189	
2190	TRANIO	And tells us, what occasion of import
2191	Hath all so long detain'd you from your wife,
2192	And sent you hither so unlike yourself?
2193	
2194	PETRUCHIO	Tedious it were to tell, and harsh to hear:
2195	Sufficeth I am come to keep my word,
2196	Though in some part enforced to digress;
2197	Which, at more leisure, I will so excuse
2198	As you shall well be satisfied withal.
2199	But where is Kate? I stay too long from her:
2200	The morning wears, 'tis time we were at church.
2201	
2202	TRANIO	See not your bride in these unreverent robes:
2203	Go to my chamber; Put on clothes of mine.
2204	
2205	PETRUCHIO	Not I, believe me: thus I'll visit her.
2206	
2207	BAPTISTA	But thus, I trust, you will not marry her.
2208	
2209	PETRUCHIO	Good sooth, even thus; therefore ha' done with words:
2210	To me she's married, not unto my clothes:
2211	Could I repair what she will wear in me,
2212	As I can change these poor accoutrements,
2213	'Twere well for Kate and better for myself.
2214	But what a fool am I to chat with you,
2215	When I should bid good morrow to my bride,
2216	And seal the title with a lovely kiss!
2217	
2218	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and GRUMIO]
2219	
2220	TRANIO	He hath some meaning in his mad attire:
2221	We will persuade him, be it possible,
2222	To put on better ere he go to church.
2223	
2224	BAPTISTA	I'll after him, and see the event of this.
2225	
2226	[Exeunt BAPTISTA, GREMIO, and attendants]
2227	
2228	TRANIO	But to her love concerneth us to add
2229	Her father's liking: which to bring to pass,
2230	As I before unparted to your worship,
2231	I am to get a man,--whate'er he be,
2232	It skills not much. we'll fit him to our turn,--
2233	And he shall be Vincentio of Pisa;
2234	And make assurance here in Padua
2235	Of greater sums than I have promised.
2236	So shall you quietly enjoy your hope,
2237	And marry sweet Bianca with consent.
2238	
2239	LUCENTIO	Were it not that my fellow-school-master
2240	Doth watch Bianca's steps so narrowly,
2241	'Twere good, methinks, to steal our marriage;
2242	Which once perform'd, let all the world say no,
2243	I'll keep mine own, despite of all the world.
2244	
2245	TRANIO	That by degrees we mean to look into,
2246	And watch our vantage in this business:
2247	We'll over-reach the greybeard, Gremio,
2248	The narrow-prying father, Minola,
2249	The quaint musician, amorous Licio;
2250	All for my master's sake, Lucentio.
2251	
2252	[Re-enter GREMIO]
2253	
2254	Signior Gremio, came you from the church?
2255	
2256	GREMIO	As willingly as e'er I came from school.
2257	
2258	TRANIO	And is the bride and bridegroom coming home?
2259	
2260	GREMIO	A bridegroom say you? 'tis a groom indeed,
2261	A grumbling groom, and that the girl shall find.
2262	
2263	TRANIO	Curster than she? why, 'tis impossible.
2264	
2265	GREMIO	Why he's a devil, a devil, a very fiend.
2266	
2267	TRANIO	Why, she's a devil, a devil, the devil's dam.
2268	
2269	GREMIO	Tut, she's a lamb, a dove, a fool to him!
2270	I'll tell you, Sir Lucentio: when the priest
2271	Should ask, if Katharina should be his wife,
2272	'Ay, by gogs-wouns,' quoth he; and swore so loud,
2273	That, all-amazed, the priest let fall the book;
2274	And, as he stoop'd again to take it up,
2275	The mad-brain'd bridegroom took him such a cuff
2276	That down fell priest and book and book and priest:
2277	'Now take them up,' quoth he, 'if any list.'
2278	
2279	TRANIO	What said the wench when he rose again?
2280	
2281	GREMIO	Trembled and shook; for why, he stamp'd and swore,
2282	As if the vicar meant to cozen him.
2283	But after many ceremonies done,
2284	He calls for wine: 'A health!' quoth he, as if
2285	He had been aboard, carousing to his mates
2286	After a storm; quaff'd off the muscadel
2287	And threw the sops all in the sexton's face;
2288	Having no other reason
2289	But that his beard grew thin and hungerly
2290	And seem'd to ask him sops as he was drinking.
2291	This done, he took the bride about the neck
2292	And kiss'd her lips with such a clamorous smack
2293	That at the parting all the church did echo:
2294	And I seeing this came thence for very shame;
2295	And after me, I know, the rout is coming.
2296	Such a mad marriage never was before:
2297	Hark, hark! I hear the minstrels play.
2298	
2299	[Music]
2300	
2301	[Re-enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, BIANCA, BAPTISTA,
2302	HORTENSIO, GRUMIO, and Train]
2303	
2304	
2305	PETRUCHIO	Gentlemen and friends, I thank you for your pains:
2306	I know you think to dine with me to-day,
2307	And have prepared great store of wedding cheer;
2308	But so it is, my haste doth call me hence,
2309	And therefore here I mean to take my leave.
2310	
2311	BAPTISTA	Is't possible you will away to-night?
2312	
2313	PETRUCHIO	I must away to-day, before night come:
2314	Make it no wonder; if you knew my business,
2315	You would entreat me rather go than stay.
2316	And, honest company, I thank you all,
2317	That have beheld me give away myself
2318	To this most patient, sweet and virtuous wife:
2319	Dine with my father, drink a health to me;
2320	For I must hence; and farewell to you all.
2321	
2322	TRANIO	Let us entreat you stay till after dinner.
2323	
2324	PETRUCHIO	It may not be.
2325	
2326	GREMIO	                  Let me entreat you.
2327	
2328	PETRUCHIO	It cannot be.
2329	
2330	KATHARINA	                  Let me entreat you.
2331	
2332	PETRUCHIO	I am content.
2333	
2334	KATHARINA	                  Are you content to stay?
2335	
2336	PETRUCHIO	I am content you shall entreat me stay;
2337	But yet not stay, entreat me how you can.
2338	
2339	KATHARINA	Now, if you love me, stay.
2340	
2341	PETRUCHIO	Grumio, my horse.
2342	
2343	GRUMIO	Ay, sir, they be ready: the oats have eaten the horses.
2344	
2345	KATHARINA	Nay, then,
2346	Do what thou canst, I will not go to-day;
2347	No, nor to-morrow, not till I please myself.
2348	The door is open, sir; there lies your way;
2349	You may be jogging whiles your boots are green;
2350	For me, I'll not be gone till I please myself:
2351	'Tis like you'll prove a jolly surly groom,
2352	That take it on you at the first so roundly.
2353	
2354	PETRUCHIO	O Kate, content thee; prithee, be not angry.
2355	
2356	KATHARINA	I will be angry: what hast thou to do?
2357	Father, be quiet; he shall stay my leisure.
2358	
2359	GREMIO	Ay, marry, sir, now it begins to work.
2360	
2361	KATARINA	Gentlemen, forward to the bridal dinner:
2362	I see a woman may be made a fool,
2363	If she had not a spirit to resist.
2364	
2365	PETRUCHIO	They shall go forward, Kate, at thy command.
2366	Obey the bride, you that attend on her;
2367	Go to the feast, revel and domineer,
2368	Carouse full measure to her maidenhead,
2369	Be mad and merry, or go hang yourselves:
2370	But for my bonny Kate, she must with me.
2371	Nay, look not big, nor stamp, nor stare, nor fret;
2372	I will be master of what is mine own:
2373	She is my goods, my chattels; she is my house,
2374	My household stuff, my field, my barn,
2375	My horse, my ox, my ass, my any thing;
2376	And here she stands, touch her whoever dare;
2377	I'll bring mine action on the proudest he
2378	That stops my way in Padua. Grumio,
2379	Draw forth thy weapon, we are beset with thieves;
2380	Rescue thy mistress, if thou be a man.
2381	Fear not, sweet wench, they shall not touch
2382	thee, Kate:
2383	I'll buckler thee against a million.
2384	
2385	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, and GRUMIO]
2386	
2387	BAPTISTA	Nay, let them go, a couple of quiet ones.
2388	
2389	GREMIO	Went they not quickly, I should die with laughing.
2390	
2391	TRANIO	Of all mad matches never was the like.
2392	
2393	LUCENTIO	Mistress, what's your opinion of your sister?
2394	
2395	BIANCA	That, being mad herself, she's madly mated.
2396	
2397	GREMIO	I warrant him, Petruchio is Kated.
2398	
2399	BAPTISTA	Neighbours and friends, though bride and
2400	bridegroom wants
2401	For to supply the places at the table,
2402	You know there wants no junkets at the feast.
2403	Lucentio, you shall supply the bridegroom's place:
2404	And let Bianca take her sister's room.
2405	
2406	TRANIO	Shall sweet Bianca practise how to bride it?
2407	
2408	BAPTISTA	She shall, Lucentio. Come, gentlemen, let's go.

2415	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
2416	
2417	
2418	ACT IV
2419	
2420	
2421	
2422	SCENE I	PETRUCHIO'S country house.
2423	
2424	
2425	[Enter GRUMIO]
2426	
2427	GRUMIO	Fie, fie on all tired jades, on all mad masters, and
2428	all foul ways! Was ever man so beaten? was ever
2429	man so rayed? was ever man so weary? I am sent
2430	before to make a fire, and they are coming after to
2431	warm them. Now, were not I a little pot and soon
2432	hot, my very lips might freeze to my teeth, my
2433	tongue to the roof of my mouth, my heart in my
2434	belly, ere I should come by a fire to thaw me: but
2435	I, with blowing the fire, shall warm myself; for,
2436	considering the weather, a taller man than I will
2437	take cold. Holla, ho! Curtis.
2438	
2439	[Enter CURTIS]
2440	
2441	CURTIS	Who is that calls so coldly?
2442	
2443	GRUMIO	A piece of ice: if thou doubt it, thou mayst slide
2444	from my shoulder to my heel with no greater a run
2445	but my head and my neck. A fire good Curtis.
2446	
2447	CURTIS	Is my master and his wife coming, Grumio?
2448	
2449	GRUMIO	O, ay, Curtis, ay: and therefore fire, fire; cast
2450	on no water.
2451	
2452	CURTIS	Is she so hot a shrew as she's reported?
2453	
2454	GRUMIO	She was, good Curtis, before this frost: but, thou
2455	knowest, winter tames man, woman and beast; for it
2456	hath tamed my old master and my new mistress and
2457	myself, fellow Curtis.
2458	
2459	CURTIS	Away, you three-inch fool! I am no beast.
2460	
2461	GRUMIO	Am I but three inches? why, thy horn is a foot; and
2462	so long am I at the least. But wilt thou make a
2463	fire, or shall I complain on thee to our mistress,
2464	whose hand, she being now at hand, thou shalt soon
2465	feel, to thy cold comfort, for being slow in thy hot office?
2466	
2467	CURTIS	I prithee, good Grumio, tell me, how goes the world?
2468	
2469	GRUMIO	A cold world, Curtis, in every office but thine; and
2470	therefore fire: do thy duty, and have thy duty; for
2471	my master and mistress are almost frozen to death.
2472	
2473	CURTIS	There's fire ready; and therefore, good Grumio, the news.
2474	
2475	GRUMIO	Why, 'Jack, boy! ho! boy!' and as much news as
2476	will thaw.
2477	
2478	CURTIS	Come, you are so full of cony-catching!
2479	
2480	GRUMIO	Why, therefore fire; for I have caught extreme cold.
2481	Where's the cook? is supper ready, the house
2482	trimmed, rushes strewed, cobwebs swept; the
2483	serving-men in their new fustian, their white
2484	stockings, and every officer his wedding-garment on?
2485	Be the jacks fair within, the jills fair without,
2486	the carpets laid, and every thing in order?
2487	
2488	CURTIS	All ready; and therefore, I pray thee, news.
2489	
2490	GRUMIO	First, know, my horse is tired; my master and
2491	mistress fallen out.
2492	
2493	CURTIS	How?
2494	
2495	GRUMIO	Out of their saddles into the dirt; and thereby
2496	hangs a tale.
2497	
2498	CURTIS	Let's ha't, good Grumio.
2499	
2500	GRUMIO	Lend thine ear.
2501	
2502	CURTIS	Here.
2503	
2504	GRUMIO	There.
2505	
2506	[Strikes him]
2507	
2508	CURTIS	This is to feel a tale, not to hear a tale.
2509	
2510	GRUMIO	And therefore 'tis called a sensible tale: and this
2511	cuff was but to knock at your ear, and beseech
2512	listening. Now I begin: Imprimis, we came down a
2513	foul hill, my master riding behind my mistress,--
2514	
2515	CURTIS	Both of one horse?
2516	
2517	GRUMIO	What's that to thee?
2518	
2519	CURTIS	Why, a horse.
2520	
2521	GRUMIO	Tell thou the tale: but hadst thou not crossed me,
2522	thou shouldst have heard how her horse fell and she
2523	under her horse; thou shouldst have heard in how
2524	miry a place, how she was bemoiled, how he left her
2525	with the horse upon her, how he beat me because
2526	her horse stumbled, how she waded through the dirt
2527	to pluck him off me, how he swore, how she prayed,
2528	that never prayed before, how I cried, how the
2529	horses ran away, how her bridle was burst, how I
2530	lost my crupper, with many things of worthy memory,
2531	which now shall die in oblivion and thou return
2532	unexperienced to thy grave.
2533	
2534	CURTIS	By this reckoning he is more shrew than she.
2535	
2536	GRUMIO	Ay; and that thou and the proudest of you all shall
2537	find when he comes home. But what talk I of this?
2538	Call forth Nathaniel, Joseph, Nicholas, Philip,
2539	Walter, Sugarsop and the rest: let their heads be
2540	sleekly combed their blue coats brushed and their
2541	garters of an indifferent knit: let them curtsy
2542	with their left legs and not presume to touch a hair
2543	of my master's horse-tail till they kiss their
2544	hands. Are they all ready?
2545	
2546	CURTIS	They are.
2547	
2548	GRUMIO	Call them forth.
2549	
2550	CURTIS	Do you hear, ho? you must meet my master to
2551	countenance my mistress.
2552	
2553	GRUMIO	Why, she hath a face of her own.
2554	
2555	CURTIS	Who knows not that?
2556	
2557	GRUMIO	Thou, it seems, that calls for company to
2558	countenance her.
2559	
2560	CURTIS	I call them forth to credit her.
2561	
2562	GRUMIO	Why, she comes to borrow nothing of them.
2563	
2564	[Enter four or five Serving-men]
2565	
2566	NATHANIEL	Welcome home, Grumio!
2567	
2568	PHILIP	How now, Grumio!
2569	
2570	JOSEPH	What, Grumio!
2571	
2572	NICHOLAS	Fellow Grumio!
2573	
2574	NATHANIEL	How now, old lad?
2575	
2576	GRUMIO	Welcome, you;--how now, you;-- what, you;--fellow,
2577	you;--and thus much for greeting. Now, my spruce
2578	companions, is all ready, and all things neat?
2579	
2580	NATHANIEL	All things is ready. How near is our master?
2581	
2582	GRUMIO	E'en at hand, alighted by this; and therefore be
2583	not--Cock's passion, silence! I hear my master.
2584	
2585	[Enter PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA]
2586	
2587	PETRUCHIO	Where be these knaves? What, no man at door
2588	To hold my stirrup nor to take my horse!
2589	Where is Nathaniel, Gregory, Philip?
2590	
2591	ALL SERVING-MEN	Here, here, sir; here, sir.
2592	
2593	PETRUCHIO	Here, sir! here, sir! here, sir! here, sir!
2594	You logger-headed and unpolish'd grooms!
2595	What, no attendance? no regard? no duty?
2596	Where is the foolish knave I sent before?
2597	
2598	GRUMIO	Here, sir; as foolish as I was before.
2599	
2600	PETRUCHIO	You peasant swain! you whoreson malt-horse drudge!
2601	Did I not bid thee meet me in the park,
2602	And bring along these rascal knaves with thee?
2603	
2604	GRUMIO	Nathaniel's coat, sir, was not fully made,
2605	And Gabriel's pumps were all unpink'd i' the heel;
2606	There was no link to colour Peter's hat,
2607	And Walter's dagger was not come from sheathing:
2608	There were none fine but Adam, Ralph, and Gregory;
2609	The rest were ragged, old, and beggarly;
2610	Yet, as they are, here are they come to meet you.
2611	
2612	PETRUCHIO	Go, rascals, go, and fetch my supper in.
2613	
2614	[Exeunt Servants]
2615	
2616	[Singing]
2617	
2618	Where is the life that late I led--
2619	Where are those--Sit down, Kate, and welcome.--
2620	Sound, sound, sound, sound!
2621	
2622	[Re-enter Servants with supper]
2623	
2624	Why, when, I say? Nay, good sweet Kate, be merry.
2625	Off with my boots, you rogues! you villains, when?
2626	
2627	[Sings]
2628	
2629	It was the friar of orders grey,
2630	As he forth walked on his way:--
2631	Out, you rogue! you pluck my foot awry:
2632	Take that, and mend the plucking off the other.
2633	
2634	[Strikes him]
2635	
2636	Be merry, Kate. Some water, here; what, ho!
2637	Where's my spaniel Troilus? Sirrah, get you hence,
2638	And bid my cousin Ferdinand come hither:
2639	One, Kate, that you must kiss, and be acquainted with.
2640	Where are my slippers? Shall I have some water?
2641	
2642	[Enter one with water]
2643	
2644	Come, Kate, and wash, and welcome heartily.
2645	You whoreson villain! will you let it fall?
2646	
2647	[Strikes him]
2648	
2649	KATHARINA	Patience, I pray you; 'twas a fault unwilling.
2650	
2651	PETRUCHIO	A whoreson beetle-headed, flap-ear'd knave!
2652	Come, Kate, sit down; I know you have a stomach.
2653	Will you give thanks, sweet Kate; or else shall I?
2654	What's this? mutton?
2655	
2656	First Servant	Ay.
2657	
2658	PETRUCHIO	Who brought it?
2659	
2660	PETER	I.
2661	
2662	PETRUCHIO	'Tis burnt; and so is all the meat.
2663	What dogs are these! Where is the rascal cook?
2664	How durst you, villains, bring it from the dresser,
2665	And serve it thus to me that love it not?
2666	Theretake it to you, trenchers, cups, and all;
2667	
2668	[Throws the meat, &c. about the stage]
2669	
2670	You heedless joltheads and unmanner'd slaves!
2671	What, do you grumble? I'll be with you straight.
2672	
2673	KATHARINA	I pray you, husband, be not so disquiet:
2674	The meat was well, if you were so contented.
2675	
2676	PETRUCHIO	I tell thee, Kate, 'twas burnt and dried away;
2677	And I expressly am forbid to touch it,
2678	For it engenders choler, planteth anger;
2679	And better 'twere that both of us did fast,
2680	Since, of ourselves, ourselves are choleric,
2681	Than feed it with such over-roasted flesh.
2682	Be patient; to-morrow 't shall be mended,
2683	And, for this night, we'll fast for company:
2684	Come, I will bring thee to thy bridal chamber.
2685	
2686	[Exeunt]
2687	
2688	[Re-enter Servants severally]
2689	
2690	NATHANIEL	Peter, didst ever see the like?
2691	
2692	PETER	He kills her in her own humour.
2693	
2694	[Re-enter CURTIS]
2695	
2696	GRUMIO	Where is he?
2697	
2698	CURTIS	In her chamber, making a sermon of continency to her;
2699	And rails, and swears, and rates, that she, poor soul,
2700	Knows not which way to stand, to look, to speak,
2701	And sits as one new-risen from a dream.
2702	Away, away! for he is coming hither.
2703	
2704	[Exeunt]
2705	
2706	[Re-enter PETRUCHIO]
2707	
2708	PETRUCHIO	Thus have I politicly begun my reign,
2709	And 'tis my hope to end successfully.
2710	My falcon now is sharp and passing empty;
2711	And till she stoop she must not be full-gorged,
2712	For then she never looks upon her lure.
2713	Another way I have to man my haggard,
2714	To make her come and know her keeper's call,
2715	That is, to watch her, as we watch these kites
2716	That bate and beat and will not be obedient.
2717	She eat no meat to-day, nor none shall eat;
2718	Last night she slept not, nor to-night she shall not;
2719	As with the meat, some undeserved fault
2720	I'll find about the making of the bed;
2721	And here I'll fling the pillow, there the bolster,
2722	This way the coverlet, another way the sheets:
2723	Ay, and amid this hurly I intend
2724	That all is done in reverend care of her;
2725	And in conclusion she shall watch all night:
2726	And if she chance to nod I'll rail and brawl
2727	And with the clamour keep her still awake.
2728	This is a way to kill a wife with kindness;
2729	And thus I'll curb her mad and headstrong humour.
2730	He that knows better how to tame a shrew,
2731	Now let him speak: 'tis charity to show.
2732

2744	
2745	SCENE II	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
2746	
2747	
2748	[Enter TRANIO and HORTENSIO]
2749	
2750	TRANIO	Is't possible, friend Licio, that Mistress Bianca
2751	Doth fancy any other but Lucentio?
2752	I tell you, sir, she bears me fair in hand.
2753	
2754	HORTENSIO	Sir, to satisfy you in what I have said,
2755	Stand by and mark the manner of his teaching.
2756	
2757	[Enter BIANCA and LUCENTIO]
2758	
2759	LUCENTIO	Now, mistress, profit you in what you read?
2760	
2761	BIANCA	What, master, read you? first resolve me that.
2762	
2763	LUCENTIO	I read that I profess, the Art to Love.
2764	
2765	BIANCA	And may you prove, sir, master of your art!
2766	
2767	LUCENTIO	While you, sweet dear, prove mistress of my heart!
2768	
2769	HORTENSIO	Quick proceeders, marry! Now, tell me, I pray,
2770	You that durst swear at your mistress Bianca
2771	Loved none in the world so well as Lucentio.
2772	
2773	TRANIO	O despiteful love! unconstant womankind!
2774	I tell thee, Licio, this is wonderful.
2775	
2776	HORTENSIO	Mistake no more: I am not Licio,
2777	Nor a musician, as I seem to be;
2778	But one that scorn to live in this disguise,
2779	For such a one as leaves a gentleman,
2780	And makes a god of such a cullion:
2781	Know, sir, that I am call'd Hortensio.
2782	
2783	TRANIO	Signior Hortensio, I have often heard
2784	Of your entire affection to Bianca;
2785	And since mine eyes are witness of her lightness,
2786	I will with you, if you be so contented,
2787	Forswear Bianca and her love for ever.
2788	
2789	HORTENSIO	See, how they kiss and court! Signior Lucentio,
2790	Here is my hand, and here I firmly vow
2791	Never to woo her no more, but do forswear her,
2792	As one unworthy all the former favours
2793	That I have fondly flatter'd her withal.
2794	
2795	TRANIO	And here I take the unfeigned oath,
2796	Never to marry with her though she would entreat:
2797	Fie on her! see, how beastly she doth court him!
2798	
2799	HORTENSIO	Would all the world but he had quite forsworn!
2800	For me, that I may surely keep mine oath,
2801	I will be married to a wealthy widow,
2802	Ere three days pass, which hath as long loved me
2803	As I have loved this proud disdainful haggard.
2804	And so farewell, Signior Lucentio.
2805	Kindness in women, not their beauteous looks,
2806	Shall win my love: and so I take my leave,
2807	In resolution as I swore before.
2808	
2809	[Exit]
2810	
2811	TRANIO	Mistress Bianca, bless you with such grace
2812	As 'longeth to a lover's blessed case!
2813	Nay, I have ta'en you napping, gentle love,
2814	And have forsworn you with Hortensio.
2815	
2816	BIANCA	Tranio, you jest: but have you both forsworn me?
2817	
2818	TRANIO	Mistress, we have.
2819	
2820	LUCENTIO	                  Then we are rid of Licio.
2821	
2822	TRANIO	I' faith, he'll have a lusty widow now,
2823	That shall be wood and wedded in a day.
2824	
2825	BIANCA	God give him joy!
2826	
2827	TRANIO	Ay, and he'll tame her.
2828	
2829	BIANCA	He says so, Tranio.
2830	
2831	TRANIO	Faith, he is gone unto the taming-school.
2832	
2833	BIANCA	The taming-school! what, is there such a place?
2834	
2835	TRANIO	Ay, mistress, and Petruchio is the master;
2836	That teacheth tricks eleven and twenty long,
2837	To tame a shrew and charm her chattering tongue.
2838	
2839	[Enter BIONDELLO]
2840	
2841	BIONDELLO	O master, master, I have watch'd so long
2842	That I am dog-weary: but at last I spied
2843	An ancient angel coming down the hill,
2844	Will serve the turn.
2845	
2846	TRANIO	What is he, Biondello?
2847	
2848	BIONDELLO	Master, a mercatante, or a pedant,
2849	I know not what; but format in apparel,
2850	In gait and countenance surely like a father.
2851	
2852	LUCENTIO	And what of him, Tranio?
2853	
2854	TRANIO	If he be credulous and trust my tale,
2855	I'll make him glad to seem Vincentio,
2856	And give assurance to Baptista Minola,
2857	As if he were the right Vincentio
2858	Take in your love, and then let me alone.
2859	
2860	[Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA]
2861	
2862	[Enter a Pedant]
2863	
2864	Pedant	God save you, sir!
2865	
2866	TRANIO	                  And you, sir! you are welcome.
2867	Travel you far on, or are you at the farthest?
2868	
2869	Pedant	Sir, at the farthest for a week or two:
2870	But then up farther, and as for as Rome;
2871	And so to Tripoli, if God lend me life.
2872	
2873	TRANIO	What countryman, I pray?
2874	
2875	Pedant	Of Mantua.
2876	
2877	TRANIO	Of Mantua, sir? marry, God forbid!
2878	And come to Padua, careless of your life?
2879	
2880	Pedant	My life, sir! how, I pray? for that goes hard.
2881	
2882	TRANIO	'Tis death for any one in Mantua
2883	To come to Padua. Know you not the cause?
2884	Your ships are stay'd at Venice, and the duke,
2885	For private quarrel 'twixt your duke and him,
2886	Hath publish'd and proclaim'd it openly:
2887	'Tis, marvel, but that you are but newly come,
2888	You might have heard it else proclaim'd about.
2889	
2890	Pedant	Alas! sir, it is worse for me than so;
2891	For I have bills for money by exchange
2892	From Florence and must here deliver them.
2893	
2894	TRANIO	Well, sir, to do you courtesy,
2895	This will I do, and this I will advise you:
2896	First, tell me, have you ever been at Pisa?
2897	Pedant	Ay, sir, in Pisa have I often been,
2898	Pisa renowned for grave citizens.
2899	
2900	TRANIO	Among them know you one Vincentio?
2901	
2902	Pedant	I know him not, but I have heard of him;
2903	A merchant of incomparable wealth.
2904	
2905	TRANIO	He is my father, sir; and, sooth to say,
2906	In countenance somewhat doth resemble you.
2907	
2908	BIONDELLO	[Aside]  As much as an apple doth an oyster,
2909	and all one.
2910	
2911	TRANIO	To save your life in this extremity,
2912	This favour will I do you for his sake;
2913	And think it not the worst of an your fortunes
2914	That you are like to Sir Vincentio.
2915	His name and credit shall you undertake,
2916	And in my house you shall be friendly lodged:
2917	Look that you take upon you as you should;
2918	You understand me, sir: so shall you stay
2919	Till you have done your business in the city:
2920	If this be courtesy, sir, accept of it.
2921	
2922	Pedant	O sir, I do; and will repute you ever
2923	The patron of my life and liberty.
2924	
2925	TRANIO	Then go with me to make the matter good.
2926	This, by the way, I let you understand;
2927	my father is here look'd for every day,
2928	To pass assurance of a dower in marriage
2929	'Twixt me and one Baptista's daughter here:
2930	In all these circumstances I'll instruct you:
2931	Go with me to clothe you as becomes you.
2932	
2933	[Exeunt]

2943	
2944	
2945	SCENE III	A room in PETRUCHIO'S house.
2946	
2947	
2948	[Enter KATHARINA and GRUMIO]
2949	
2950	GRUMIO	No, no, forsooth; I dare not for my life.
2951	
2952	KATHARINA	The more my wrong, the more his spite appears:
2953	What, did he marry me to famish me?
2954	Beggars, that come unto my father's door,
2955	Upon entreaty have a present aims;
2956	If not, elsewhere they meet with charity:
2957	But I, who never knew how to entreat,
2958	Nor never needed that I should entreat,
2959	Am starved for meat, giddy for lack of sleep,
2960	With oath kept waking and with brawling fed:
2961	And that which spites me more than all these wants,
2962	He does it under name of perfect love;
2963	As who should say, if I should sleep or eat,
2964	'Twere deadly sickness or else present death.
2965	I prithee go and get me some repast;
2966	I care not what, so it be wholesome food.
2967	
2968	GRUMIO	What say you to a neat's foot?
2969	
2970	KATHARINA	'Tis passing good: I prithee let me have it.
2971	
2972	GRUMIO	I fear it is too choleric a meat.
2973	How say you to a fat tripe finely broil'd?
2974	
2975	KATHARINA	I like it well: good Grumio, fetch it me.
2976	
2977	GRUMIO	I cannot tell; I fear 'tis choleric.
2978	What say you to a piece of beef and mustard?
2979	
2980	KATHARINA	A dish that I do love to feed upon.
2981	
2982	GRUMIO	Ay, but the mustard is too hot a little.
2983	
2984	KATHARINA	Why then, the beef, and let the mustard rest.
2985	
2986	GRUMIO	Nay then, I will not: you shall have the mustard,
2987	Or else you get no beef of Grumio.
2988	
2989	KATHARINA	Then both, or one, or any thing thou wilt.
2990	
2991	GRUMIO	Why then, the mustard without the beef.
2992	
2993	KATHARINA	Go, get thee gone, thou false deluding slave,
2994	
2995	[Beats him]
2996	
2997	That feed'st me with the very name of meat:
2998	Sorrow on thee and all the pack of you,
2999	That triumph thus upon my misery!
3000	Go, get thee gone, I say.
3001	
3002	[Enter PETRUCHIO and HORTENSIO with meat]
3003	
3004	PETRUCHIO	How fares my Kate? What, sweeting, all amort?
3005	
3006	HORTENSIO	Mistress, what cheer?
3007	
3008	KATHARINA	Faith, as cold as can be.
3009	
3010	PETRUCHIO	Pluck up thy spirits; look cheerfully upon me.
3011	Here love; thou see'st how diligent I am
3012	To dress thy meat myself and bring it thee:
3013	I am sure, sweet Kate, this kindness merits thanks.
3014	What, not a word? Nay, then thou lovest it not;
3015	And all my pains is sorted to no proof.
3016	Here, take away this dish.
3017	
3018	KATHARINA	I pray you, let it stand.
3019	
3020	PETRUCHIO	The poorest service is repaid with thanks;
3021	And so shall mine, before you touch the meat.
3022	
3023	KATHARINA	I thank you, sir.
3024	
3025	HORTENSIO	Signior Petruchio, fie! you are to blame.
3026	Come, mistress Kate, I'll bear you company.
3027	
3028	PETRUCHIO	[Aside]  Eat it up all, Hortensio, if thou lovest me.
3029	Much good do it unto thy gentle heart!
3030	Kate, eat apace: and now, my honey love,
3031	Will we return unto thy father's house
3032	And revel it as bravely as the best,
3033	With silken coats and caps and golden rings,
3034	With ruffs and cuffs and fardingales and things;
3035	With scarfs and fans and double change of bravery,
3036	With amber bracelets, beads and all this knavery.
3037	What, hast thou dined? The tailor stays thy leisure,
3038	To deck thy body with his ruffling treasure.
3039	
3040	[Enter Tailor]
3041	
3042	Come, tailor, let us see these ornaments;
3043	Lay forth the gown.
3044	
3045	[Enter Haberdasher]
3046	
3047	What news with you, sir?
3048	
3049	Haberdasher	Here is the cap your worship did bespeak.
3050	
3051	PETRUCHIO	Why, this was moulded on a porringer;
3052	A velvet dish: fie, fie! 'tis lewd and filthy:
3053	Why, 'tis a cockle or a walnut-shell,
3054	A knack, a toy, a trick, a baby's cap:
3055	Away with it! come, let me have a bigger.
3056	
3057	KATHARINA	I'll have no bigger: this doth fit the time,
3058	And gentlewomen wear such caps as these
3059	
3060	PETRUCHIO	When you are gentle, you shall have one too,
3061	And not till then.
3062	
3063	HORTENSIO	[Aside]  That will not be in haste.
3064	
3065	KATHARINA	Why, sir, I trust I may have leave to speak;
3066	And speak I will; I am no child, no babe:
3067	Your betters have endured me say my mind,
3068	And if you cannot, best you stop your ears.
3069	My tongue will tell the anger of my heart,
3070	Or else my heart concealing it will break,
3071	And rather than it shall, I will be free
3072	Even to the uttermost, as I please, in words.
3073	
3074	PETRUCHIO	Why, thou say'st true; it is a paltry cap,
3075	A custard-coffin, a bauble, a silken pie:
3076	I love thee well, in that thou likest it not.
3077	
3078	KATHARINA	Love me or love me not, I like the cap;
3079	And it I will have, or I will have none.
3080	
3081	[Exit Haberdasher]
3082	
3083	PETRUCHIO	Thy gown? why, ay: come, tailor, let us see't.
3084	O mercy, God! what masquing stuff is here?
3085	What's this? a sleeve? 'tis like a demi-cannon:
3086	What, up and down, carved like an apple-tart?
3087	Here's snip and nip and cut and slish and slash,
3088	Like to a censer in a barber's shop:
3089	Why, what, i' devil's name, tailor, call'st thou this?
3090	
3091	HORTENSIO	[Aside]  I see she's like to have neither cap nor gown.
3092	
3093	Tailor	You bid me make it orderly and well,
3094	According to the fashion and the time.
3095	
3096	PETRUCHIO	Marry, and did; but if you be remember'd,
3097	I did not bid you mar it to the time.
3098	Go, hop me over every kennel home,
3099	For you shall hop without my custom, sir:
3100	I'll none of it: hence! make your best of it.
3101	
3102	KATHARINA	I never saw a better-fashion'd gown,
3103	More quaint, more pleasing, nor more commendable:
3104	Belike you mean to make a puppet of me.
3105	
3106	PETRUCHIO	Why, true; he means to make a puppet of thee.
3107	
3108	Tailor	She says your worship means to make
3109	a puppet of her.
3110	
3111	PETRUCHIO	O monstrous arrogance! Thou liest, thou thread,
3112	thou thimble,
3113	Thou yard, three-quarters, half-yard, quarter, nail!
3114	Thou flea, thou nit, thou winter-cricket thou!
3115	Braved in mine own house with a skein of thread?
3116	Away, thou rag, thou quantity, thou remnant;
3117	Or I shall so be-mete thee with thy yard
3118	As thou shalt think on prating whilst thou livest!
3119	I tell thee, I, that thou hast marr'd her gown.
3120	
3121	Tailor	Your worship is deceived; the gown is made
3122	Just as my master had direction:
3123	Grumio gave order how it should be done.
3124	
3125	GRUMIO	I gave him no order; I gave him the stuff.
3126	
3127	Tailor	But how did you desire it should be made?
3128	
3129	GRUMIO	Marry, sir, with needle and thread.
3130	
3131	Tailor	But did you not request to have it cut?
3132	
3133	GRUMIO	Thou hast faced many things.
3134	
3135	Tailor	I have.
3136	
3137	GRUMIO	Face not me: thou hast braved many men; brave not
3138	me; I will neither be faced nor braved. I say unto
3139	thee, I bid thy master cut out the gown; but I did
3140	not bid him cut it to pieces: ergo, thou liest.
3141	
3142	Tailor	Why, here is the note of the fashion to testify
3143	
3144	PETRUCHIO	Read it.
3145	
3146	GRUMIO	The note lies in's throat, if he say I said so.
3147	
3148	Tailor	[Reads]  'Imprimis, a loose-bodied gown:'
3149	
3150	GRUMIO	Master, if ever I said loose-bodied gown, sew me in
3151	the skirts of it, and beat me to death with a bottom
3152	of brown thread: I said a gown.
3153	
3154	PETRUCHIO	Proceed.
3155	
3156	Tailor	[Reads]  'With a small compassed cape:'
3157	
3158	GRUMIO	I confess the cape.
3159	
3160	Tailor	[Reads]  'With a trunk sleeve:'
3161	
3162	GRUMIO	I confess two sleeves.
3163	
3164	Tailor	[Reads]  'The sleeves curiously cut.'
3165	
3166	PETRUCHIO	Ay, there's the villany.
3167	
3168	GRUMIO	Error i' the bill, sir; error i' the bill.
3169	I commanded the sleeves should be cut out and
3170	sewed up again; and that I'll prove upon thee,
3171	though thy little finger be armed in a thimble.
3172	
3173	Tailor	This is true that I say: an I had thee
3174	in place where, thou shouldst know it.
3175	
3176	GRUMIO	I am for thee straight: take thou the
3177	bill, give me thy mete-yard, and spare not me.
3178	
3179	HORTENSIO	God-a-mercy, Grumio! then he shall have no odds.
3180	
3181	PETRUCHIO	Well, sir, in brief, the gown is not for me.
3182	
3183	GRUMIO	You are i' the right, sir: 'tis for my mistress.
3184	
3185	PETRUCHIO	Go, take it up unto thy master's use.
3186	
3187	GRUMIO	Villain, not for thy life: take up my mistress'
3188	gown for thy master's use!
3189	
3190	PETRUCHIO	Why, sir, what's your conceit in that?
3191	
3192	GRUMIO	O, sir, the conceit is deeper than you think for:
3193	Take up my mistress' gown to his master's use!
3194	O, fie, fie, fie!
3195	
3196	PETRUCHIO	[Aside]  Hortensio, say thou wilt see the tailor paid.
3197	Go take it hence; be gone, and say no more.
3198	
3199	HORTENSIO	Tailor, I'll pay thee for thy gown tomorrow:
3200	Take no unkindness of his hasty words:
3201	Away! I say; commend me to thy master.
3202	
3203	[Exit Tailor]
3204	
3205	PETRUCHIO	Well, come, my Kate; we will unto your father's
3206	Even in these honest mean habiliments:
3207	Our purses shall be proud, our garments poor;
3208	For 'tis the mind that makes the body rich;
3209	And as the sun breaks through the darkest clouds,
3210	So honour peereth in the meanest habit.
3211	What is the jay more precious than the lark,
3212	Because his fathers are more beautiful?
3213	Or is the adder better than the eel,
3214	Because his painted skin contents the eye?
3215	O, no, good Kate; neither art thou the worse
3216	For this poor furniture and mean array.
3217	if thou account'st it shame. lay it on me;
3218	And therefore frolic: we will hence forthwith,
3219	To feast and sport us at thy father's house.
3220	Go, call my men, and let us straight to him;
3221	And bring our horses unto Long-lane end;
3222	There will we mount, and thither walk on foot
3223	Let's see; I think 'tis now some seven o'clock,
3224	And well we may come there by dinner-time.
3225	
3226	KATHARINA	I dare assure you, sir, 'tis almost two;
3227	And 'twill be supper-time ere you come there.
3228	
3229	PETRUCHIO	It shall be seven ere I go to horse:
3230	Look, what I speak, or do, or think to do,
3231	You are still crossing it. Sirs, let't alone:
3232	I will not go to-day; and ere I do,
3233	It shall be what o'clock I say it is.
3234	
3235	HORTENSIO	[Aside]  Why, so this gallant will command the sun.

3245	ACT IV
3246	
3247	
3248	
3249	SCENE IV	Padua. Before BAPTISTA'S house.
3250	
3251	
3252	[Enter TRANIO, and the Pedant dressed like VINCENTIO]
3253	
3254	TRANIO	Sir, this is the house: please it you that I call?
3255	
3256	Pedant	Ay, what else? and but I be deceived
3257	Signior Baptista may remember me,
3258	Near twenty years ago, in Genoa,
3259	Where we were lodgers at the Pegasus.
3260	
3261	TRANIO	'Tis well; and hold your own, in any case,
3262	With such austerity as 'longeth to a father.
3263	
3264	Pedant	I warrant you.
3265	
3266	[Enter BIONDELLO]
3267	
3268	But, sir, here comes your boy;
3269	'Twere good he were school'd.
3270	
3271	TRANIO	Fear you not him. Sirrah Biondello,
3272	Now do your duty throughly, I advise you:
3273	Imagine 'twere the right Vincentio.
3274	
3275	BIONDELLO	Tut, fear not me.
3276	
3277	TRANIO	But hast thou done thy errand to Baptista?
3278	
3279	BIONDELLO	I told him that your father was at Venice,
3280	And that you look'd for him this day in Padua.
3281	
3282	TRANIO	Thou'rt a tall fellow: hold thee that to drink.
3283	Here comes Baptista: set your countenance, sir.
3284	
3285	[Enter BAPTISTA and LUCENTIO]
3286	
3287	Signior Baptista, you are happily met.
3288	
3289	[To the Pedant]
3290	
3291	Sir, this is the gentleman I told you of:
3292	I pray you stand good father to me now,
3293	Give me Bianca for my patrimony.
3294	
3295	Pedant	Soft son!
3296	Sir, by your leave: having come to Padua
3297	To gather in some debts, my son Lucentio
3298	Made me acquainted with a weighty cause
3299	Of love between your daughter and himself:
3300	And, for the good report I hear of you
3301	And for the love he beareth to your daughter
3302	And she to him, to stay him not too long,
3303	I am content, in a good father's care,
3304	To have him match'd; and if you please to like
3305	No worse than I, upon some agreement
3306	Me shall you find ready and willing
3307	With one consent to have her so bestow'd;
3308	For curious I cannot be with you,
3309	Signior Baptista, of whom I hear so well.
3310	
3311	BAPTISTA	Sir, pardon me in what I have to say:
3312	Your plainness and your shortness please me well.
3313	Right true it is, your son Lucentio here
3314	Doth love my daughter and she loveth him,
3315	Or both dissemble deeply their affections:
3316	And therefore, if you say no more than this,
3317	That like a father you will deal with him
3318	And pass my daughter a sufficient dower,
3319	The match is made, and all is done:
3320	Your son shall have my daughter with consent.
3321	
3322	TRANIO	I thank you, sir. Where then do you know best
3323	We be affied and such assurance ta'en
3324	As shall with either part's agreement stand?
3325	
3326	BAPTISTA	Not in my house, Lucentio; for, you know,
3327	Pitchers have ears, and I have many servants:
3328	Besides, old Gremio is hearkening still;
3329	And happily we might be interrupted.
3330	
3331	TRANIO	Then at my lodging, an it like you:
3332	There doth my father lie; and there, this night,
3333	We'll pass the business privately and well.
3334	Send for your daughter by your servant here:
3335	My boy shall fetch the scrivener presently.
3336	The worst is this, that, at so slender warning,
3337	You are like to have a thin and slender pittance.
3338	
3339	BAPTISTA	It likes me well. Biondello, hie you home,
3340	And bid Bianca make her ready straight;
3341	And, if you will, tell what hath happened,
3342	Lucentio's father is arrived in Padua,
3343	And how she's like to be Lucentio's wife.
3344	
3345	BIONDELLO	I pray the gods she may with all my heart!
3346	
3347	TRANIO	Dally not with the gods, but get thee gone.
3348	
3349	[Exit BIONDELLO]
3350	
3351	Signior Baptista, shall I lead the way?
3352	Welcome! one mess is like to be your cheer:
3353	Come, sir; we will better it in Pisa.
3354	
3355	BAPTISTA	I follow you.
3356	
3357	[Exeunt TRANIO, Pedant, and BAPTISTA]
3358	
3359	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
3360	
3361	BIONDELLO	Cambio!
3362	
3363	LUCENTIO	What sayest thou, Biondello?
3364	
3365	BIONDELLO	You saw my master wink and laugh upon you?
3366	
3367	LUCENTIO	Biondello, what of that?
3368	
3369	BIONDELLO	Faith, nothing; but has left me here behind, to
3370	expound the meaning or moral of his signs and tokens.
3371	
3372	LUCENTIO	I pray thee, moralize them.
3373	
3374	BIONDELLO	Then thus. Baptista is safe, talking with the
3375	deceiving father of a deceitful son.
3376	
3377	LUCENTIO	And what of him?
3378	
3379	BIONDELLO	His daughter is to be brought by you to the supper.
3380	
3381	LUCENTIO	And then?
3382	
3383	BIONDELLO	The old priest of Saint Luke's church is at your
3384	command at all hours.
3385	
3386	LUCENTIO	And what of all this?
3387	
3388	BIONDELLO	I cannot tell; expect they are busied about a
3389	counterfeit assurance: take you assurance of her,
3390	'cum privilegio ad imprimendum solum:' to the
3391	church; take the priest, clerk, and some sufficient
3392	honest witnesses: If this be not that you look for,
3393	I have no more to say, But bid Bianca farewell for
3394	ever and a day.
3395	
3396	LUCENTIO	Hearest thou, Biondello?
3397	
3398	BIONDELLO	I cannot tarry: I knew a wench married in an
3399	afternoon as she went to the garden for parsley to
3400	stuff a rabbit; and so may you, sir: and so, adieu,
3401	sir. My master hath appointed me to go to Saint
3402	Luke's, to bid the priest be ready to come against
3403	you come with your appendix.
3404	
3405	[Exit]
3406	
3407	LUCENTIO	I may, and will, if she be so contented:
3408	She will be pleased; then wherefore should I doubt?
3409	Hap what hap may, I'll roundly go about her:
3410	It shall go hard if Cambio go without her.

3427	[Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO, and Servants]
3428	
3429	PETRUCHIO	Come on, i' God's name; once more toward our father's.
3430	Good Lord, how bright and goodly shines the moon!
3431	
3432	KATHARINA	The moon! the sun: it is not moonlight now.
3433	
3434	PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon that shines so bright.
3435	
3436	KATHARINA	I know it is the sun that shines so bright.
3437	
3438	PETRUCHIO	Now, by my mother's son, and that's myself,
3439	It shall be moon, or star, or what I list,
3440	Or ere I journey to your father's house.
3441	Go on, and fetch our horses back again.
3442	Evermore cross'd and cross'd; nothing but cross'd!
3443	
3444	HORTENSIO	Say as he says, or we shall never go.
3445	
3446	KATHARINA	Forward, I pray, since we have come so far,
3447	And be it moon, or sun, or what you please:
3448	An if you please to call it a rush-candle,
3449	Henceforth I vow it shall be so for me.
3450	
3451	PETRUCHIO	I say it is the moon.
3452	
3453	KATHARINA	I know it is the moon.
3454	
3455	PETRUCHIO	Nay, then you lie: it is the blessed sun.
3456	
3457	KATHARINA	Then, God be bless'd, it is the blessed sun:
3458	But sun it is not, when you say it is not;
3459	And the moon changes even as your mind.
3460	What you will have it named, even that it is;
3461	And so it shall be so for Katharina.
3462	
3463	HORTENSIO	Petruchio, go thy ways; the field is won.
3464	
3465	PETRUCHIO	Well, forward, forward! thus the bowl should run,
3466	And not unluckily against the bias.
3467	But, soft! company is coming here.
3468	
3469	[Enter VINCENTIO]
3470	
3471	[To VINCENTIO]
3472	
3473	Good morrow, gentle mistress: where away?
3474	Tell me, sweet Kate, and tell me truly too,
3475	Hast thou beheld a fresher gentlewoman?
3476	Such war of white and red within her cheeks!
3477	What stars do spangle heaven with such beauty,
3478	As those two eyes become that heavenly face?
3479	Fair lovely maid, once more good day to thee.
3480	Sweet Kate, embrace her for her beauty's sake.
3481	
3482	HORTENSIO	A' will make the man mad, to make a woman of him.
3483	
3484	KATHARINA	Young budding virgin, fair and fresh and sweet,
3485	Whither away, or where is thy abode?
3486	Happy the parents of so fair a child;
3487	Happier the man, whom favourable stars
3488	Allot thee for his lovely bed-fellow!
3489	
3490	PETRUCHIO	Why, how now, Kate! I hope thou art not mad:
3491	This is a man, old, wrinkled, faded, wither'd,
3492	And not a maiden, as thou say'st he is.
3493	
3494	KATHARINA	Pardon, old father, my mistaking eyes,
3495	That have been so bedazzled with the sun
3496	That everything I look on seemeth green:
3497	Now I perceive thou art a reverend father;
3498	Pardon, I pray thee, for my mad mistaking.
3499	
3500	PETRUCHIO	Do, good old grandsire; and withal make known
3501	Which way thou travellest: if along with us,
3502	We shall be joyful of thy company.
3503	
3504	VINCENTIO	Fair sir, and you my merry mistress,
3505	That with your strange encounter much amazed me,
3506	My name is call'd Vincentio; my dwelling Pisa;
3507	And bound I am to Padua; there to visit
3508	A son of mine, which long I have not seen.
3509	
3510	PETRUCHIO	What is his name?
3511	
3512	VINCENTIO	                  Lucentio, gentle sir.
3513	
3514	PETRUCHIO	Happily we met; the happier for thy son.
3515	And now by law, as well as reverend age,
3516	I may entitle thee my loving father:
3517	The sister to my wife, this gentlewoman,
3518	Thy son by this hath married. Wonder not,
3519	Nor be grieved: she is of good esteem,
3520	Her dowery wealthy, and of worthy birth;
3521	Beside, so qualified as may beseem
3522	The spouse of any noble gentleman.
3523	Let me embrace with old Vincentio,
3524	And wander we to see thy honest son,
3525	Who will of thy arrival be full joyous.
3526	
3527	VINCENTIO	But is it true? or else is it your pleasure,
3528	Like pleasant travellers, to break a jest
3529	Upon the company you overtake?
3530	
3531	HORTENSIO	I do assure thee, father, so it is.
3532	
3533	PETRUCHIO	Come, go along, and see the truth hereof;
3534	For our first merriment hath made thee jealous.
3535	
3536	[Exeunt all but HORTENSIO]
3537	
3538	HORTENSIO	Well, Petruchio, this has put me in heart.
3539	Have to my widow! and if she be froward,
3540	Then hast thou taught Hortensio to be untoward.

3557	[GREMIO discovered. Enter behind BIONDELLO,
3558	LUCENTIO, and BIANCA]
3559	
3560	BIONDELLO	Softly and swiftly, sir; for the priest is ready.
3561	
3562	LUCENTIO	I fly, Biondello: but they may chance to need thee
3563	at home; therefore leave us.
3564	
3565	BIONDELLO	Nay, faith, I'll see the church o' your back; and
3566	then come back to my master's as soon as I can.
3567	
3568	[Exeunt LUCENTIO, BIANCA, and BIONDELLO]
3569	
3570	GREMIO	I marvel Cambio comes not all this while.
3571	
3572	[Enter PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, VINCENTIO, GRUMIO,
3573	with Attendants]
3574	
3575	PETRUCHIO	Sir, here's the door, this is Lucentio's house:
3576	My father's bears more toward the market-place;
3577	Thither must I, and here I leave you, sir.
3578	
3579	VINCENTIO	You shall not choose but drink before you go:
3580	I think I shall command your welcome here,
3581	And, by all likelihood, some cheer is toward.
3582	
3583	[Knocks]
3584	
3585	GREMIO	They're busy within; you were best knock louder.
3586	
3587	[Pedant looks out of the window]
3588	
3589	Pedant	What's he that knocks as he would beat down the gate?
3590	
3591	VINCENTIO	Is Signior Lucentio within, sir?
3592	
3593	Pedant	He's within, sir, but not to be spoken withal.
3594	
3595	VINCENTIO	What if a man bring him a hundred pound or two, to
3596	make merry withal?
3597	
3598	Pedant	Keep your hundred pounds to yourself: he shall
3599	need none, so long as I live.
3600	
3601	PETRUCHIO	Nay, I told you your son was well beloved in Padua.
3602	Do you hear, sir? To leave frivolous circumstances,
3603	I pray you, tell Signior Lucentio that his father is
3604	come from Pisa, and is here at the door to speak with him.
3605	
3606	Pedant	Thou liest: his father is come from Padua and here
3607	looking out at the window.
3608	
3609	VINCENTIO	Art thou his father?
3610	
3611	Pedant	Ay, sir; so his mother says, if I may believe her.
3612	
3613	PETRUCHIO	[To VINCENTIO]  Why, how now, gentleman! why, this
3614	is flat knavery, to take upon you another man's name.
3615	
3616	Pedant	Lay hands on the villain: I believe a' means to
3617	cozen somebody in this city under my countenance.
3618	
3619	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
3620	
3621	BIONDELLO	I have seen them in the church together: God send
3622	'em good shipping! But who is here? mine old
3623	master Vincentio! now we are undone and brought to nothing.
3624	
3625	VINCENTIO	[Seeing BIONDELLO]
3626	
3627	Come hither, crack-hemp.
3628	
3629	BIONDELLO	Hope I may choose, sir.
3630	
3631	VINCENTIO	Come hither, you rogue. What, have you forgot me?
3632	
3633	BIONDELLO	Forgot you! no, sir: I could not forget you, for I
3634	never saw you before in all my life.
3635	
3636	VINCENTIO	What, you notorious villain, didst thou never see
3637	thy master's father, Vincentio?
3638	
3639	BIONDELLO	What, my old worshipful old master? yes, marry, sir:
3640	see where he looks out of the window.
3641	
3642	VINCENTIO	Is't so, indeed.
3643	
3644	[Beats BIONDELLO]
3645	
3646	BIONDELLO	Help, help, help! here's a madman will murder me.
3647	
3648	[Exit]
3649	
3650	Pedant	Help, son! help, Signior Baptista!
3651	
3652	[Exit from above]
3653	
3654	PETRUCHIO	Prithee, Kate, let's stand aside and see the end of
3655	this controversy.
3656	
3657	[They retire]
3658	
3659	[Re-enter Pedant below; TRANIO, BAPTISTA, and Servants]
3660	
3661	TRANIO	Sir, what are you that offer to beat my servant?
3662	
3663	VINCENTIO	What am I, sir! nay, what are you, sir? O immortal
3664	gods! O fine villain! A silken doublet! a velvet
3665	hose! a scarlet cloak! and a copatain hat! O, I
3666	am undone! I am undone! while I play the good
3667	husband at home, my son and my servant spend all at
3668	the university.
3669	
3670	TRANIO	How now! what's the matter?
3671	
3672	BAPTISTA	What, is the man lunatic?
3673	
3674	TRANIO	Sir, you seem a sober ancient gentleman by your
3675	habit, but your words show you a madman. Why, sir,
3676	what 'cerns it you if I wear pearl and gold? I
3677	thank my good father, I am able to maintain it.
3678	
3679	VINCENTIO	Thy father! O villain! he is a sailmaker in Bergamo.
3680	
3681	BAPTISTA	You mistake, sir, you mistake, sir. Pray, what do
3682	you think is his name?
3683	
3684	VINCENTIO	His name! as if I knew not his name: I have brought
3685	him up ever since he was three years old, and his
3686	name is Tranio.
3687	
3688	Pedant	Away, away, mad ass! his name is Lucentio and he is
3689	mine only son, and heir to the lands of me, Signior Vincentio.
3690	
3691	VINCENTIO	Lucentio! O, he hath murdered his master! Lay hold
3692	on him, I charge you, in the duke's name. O, my
3693	son, my son! Tell me, thou villain, where is my son Lucentio?
3694	
3695	TRANIO	Call forth an officer.
3696	
3697	[Enter one with an Officer]
3698	
3699	Carry this mad knave to the gaol. Father Baptista,
3700	I charge you see that he be forthcoming.
3701	
3702	VINCENTIO	Carry me to the gaol!
3703	
3704	GREMIO	Stay, officer: he shall not go to prison.
3705	
3706	BAPTISTA	Talk not, Signior Gremio: I say he shall go to prison.
3707	
3708	GREMIO	Take heed, Signior Baptista, lest you be
3709	cony-catched in this business: I dare swear this
3710	is the right Vincentio.
3711	
3712	Pedant	Swear, if thou darest.
3713	
3714	GREMIO	Nay, I dare not swear it.
3715	
3716	TRANIO	Then thou wert best say that I am not Lucentio.
3717	
3718	GREMIO	Yes, I know thee to be Signior Lucentio.
3719	
3720	BAPTISTA	Away with the dotard! to the gaol with him!
3721	
3722	VINCENTIO	Thus strangers may be hailed and abused: O
3723	monstrous villain!
3724	
3725	[Re-enter BIONDELLO, with LUCENTIO and BIANCA]
3726	
3727	BIONDELLO	O! we are spoiled and--yonder he is: deny him,
3728	forswear him, or else we are all undone.
3729	
3730	LUCENTIO	[Kneeling]  Pardon, sweet father.
3731	
3732	VINCENTIO	Lives my sweet son?
3733	
3734	[Exeunt BIONDELLO, TRANIO, and Pedant, as fast
3735	as may be]
3736	
3737	BIANCA	Pardon, dear father.
3738	
3739	BAPTISTA	How hast thou offended?
3740	Where is Lucentio?
3741	
3742	LUCENTIO	                  Here's Lucentio,
3743	Right son to the right Vincentio;
3744	That have by marriage made thy daughter mine,
3745	While counterfeit supposes bleared thine eyne.
3746	
3747	GREMIO	Here's packing, with a witness to deceive us all!
3748	
3749	VINCENTIO	Where is that damned villain Tranio,
3750	That faced and braved me in this matter so?
3751	
3752	BAPTISTA	Why, tell me, is not this my Cambio?
3753	
3754	BIANCA	Cambio is changed into Lucentio.
3755	
3756	LUCENTIO	Love wrought these miracles. Bianca's love
3757	Made me exchange my state with Tranio,
3758	While he did bear my countenance in the town;
3759	And happily I have arrived at the last
3760	Unto the wished haven of my bliss.
3761	What Tranio did, myself enforced him to;
3762	Then pardon him, sweet father, for my sake.
3763	
3764	VINCENTIO	I'll slit the villain's nose, that would have sent
3765	me to the gaol.
3766	
3767	BAPTISTA	But do you hear, sir? have you married my daughter
3768	without asking my good will?
3769	
3770	VINCENTIO	Fear not, Baptista; we will content you, go to: but
3771	I will in, to be revenged for this villany.
3772	
3773	[Exit]
3774	
3775	BAPTISTA	And I, to sound the depth of this knavery.
3776	
3777	[Exit]
3778	
3779	LUCENTIO	Look not pale, Bianca; thy father will not frown.
3780	
3781	[Exeunt LUCENTIO and BIANCA]
3782	
3783	GREMIO	My cake is dough; but I'll in among the rest,
3784	Out of hope of all, but my share of the feast.
3785	
3786	[Exit]
3787	
3788	KATHARINA	Husband, let's follow, to see the end of this ado.
3789	
3790	PETRUCHIO	First kiss me, Kate, and we will.
3791	
3792	KATHARINA	What, in the midst of the street?
3793	
3794	PETRUCHIO	What, art thou ashamed of me?
3795	
3796	KATHARINA	No, sir, God forbid; but ashamed to kiss.
3797	
3798	PETRUCHIO	Why, then let's home again. Come, sirrah, let's away.
3799	
3800	KATHARINA	Nay, I will give thee a kiss: now pray thee, love, stay.
3801	
3802	PETRUCHIO	Is not this well? Come, my sweet Kate:
3803	Better once than never, for never too late.
3804	
3805	[Exeunt]
3806	
3807

3810	THE TAMING OF THE SHREW
3811	
3812	
3813	ACT V
3814	
3815	
3816	
3817	SCENE II	Padua. LUCENTIO'S house.
3818	
3819	
3820	[Enter BAPTISTA, VINCENTIO, GREMIO, the Pedant,
3821	LUCENTIO, BIANCA, PETRUCHIO, KATHARINA, HORTENSIO,
3822	and Widow, TRANIO, BIONDELLO, and GRUMIO the
3823	Serving-men with Tranio bringing in a banquet]
3824	
3825	LUCENTIO	At last, though long, our jarring notes agree:
3826	And time it is, when raging war is done,
3827	To smile at scapes and perils overblown.
3828	My fair Bianca, bid my father welcome,
3829	While I with self-same kindness welcome thine.
3830	Brother Petruchio, sister Katharina,
3831	And thou, Hortensio, with thy loving widow,
3832	Feast with the best, and welcome to my house:
3833	My banquet is to close our stomachs up,
3834	After our great good cheer. Pray you, sit down;
3835	For now we sit to chat as well as eat.
3836	
3837	PETRUCHIO	Nothing but sit and sit, and eat and eat!
3838	
3839	BAPTISTA	Padua affords this kindness, son Petruchio.
3840	
3841	PETRUCHIO	Padua affords nothing but what is kind.
3842	
3843	HORTENSIO	For both our sakes, I would that word were true.
3844	
3845	PETRUCHIO	Now, for my life, Hortensio fears his widow.
3846	
3847	Widow	Then never trust me, if I be afeard.
3848	
3849	PETRUCHIO	You are very sensible, and yet you miss my sense:
3850	I mean, Hortensio is afeard of you.
3851	
3852	Widow	He that is giddy thinks the world turns round.
3853	
3854	PETRUCHIO	Roundly replied.
3855	
3856	KATHARINA	                  Mistress, how mean you that?
3857	
3858	Widow	Thus I conceive by him.
3859	
3860	PETRUCHIO	Conceives by me! How likes Hortensio that?
3861	
3862	HORTENSIO	My widow says, thus she conceives her tale.
3863	
3864	PETRUCHIO	Very well mended. Kiss him for that, good widow.
3865	
3866	KATHARINA	'He that is giddy thinks the world turns round:'
3867	I pray you, tell me what you meant by that.
3868	
3869	Widow	Your husband, being troubled with a shrew,
3870	Measures my husband's sorrow by his woe:
3871	And now you know my meaning,
3872	
3873	KATHARINA	A very mean meaning.
3874	
3875	Widow	Right, I mean you.
3876	
3877	KATHARINA	And I am mean indeed, respecting you.
3878	
3879	PETRUCHIO	To her, Kate!
3880	
3881	HORTENSIO	To her, widow!
3882	
3883	PETRUCHIO	A hundred marks, my Kate does put her down.
3884	
3885	HORTENSIO	That's my office.
3886	
3887	PETRUCHIO	Spoke like an officer; ha' to thee, lad!
3888	
3889	[Drinks to HORTENSIO]
3890	
3891	BAPTISTA	How likes Gremio these quick-witted folks?
3892	
3893	GREMIO	Believe me, sir, they butt together well.
3894	
3895	BIANCA	Head, and butt! an hasty-witted body
3896	Would say your head and butt were head and horn.
3897	
3898	VINCENTIO	Ay, mistress bride, hath that awaken'd you?
3899	
3900	BIANCA	Ay, but not frighted me; therefore I'll sleep again.
3901	
3902	PETRUCHIO	Nay, that you shall not: since you have begun,
3903	Have at you for a bitter jest or two!
3904	
3905	BIANCA	Am I your bird? I mean to shift my bush;
3906	And then pursue me as you draw your bow.
3907	You are welcome all.
3908	
3909	[Exeunt BIANCA, KATHARINA, and Widow]
3910	
3911	PETRUCHIO	She hath prevented me. Here, Signior Tranio.
3912	This bird you aim'd at, though you hit her not;
3913	Therefore a health to all that shot and miss'd.
3914	
3915	TRANIO	O, sir, Lucentio slipp'd me like his greyhound,
3916	Which runs himself and catches for his master.
3917	
3918	PETRUCHIO	A good swift simile, but something currish.
3919	
3920	TRANIO	'Tis well, sir, that you hunted for yourself:
3921	'Tis thought your deer does hold you at a bay.
3922	
3923	BAPTISTA	O ho, Petruchio! Tranio hits you now.
3924	
3925	LUCENTIO	I thank thee for that gird, good Tranio.
3926	
3927	HORTENSIO	Confess, confess, hath he not hit you here?
3928	
3929	PETRUCHIO	A' has a little gall'd me, I confess;
3930	And, as the jest did glance away from me,
3931	'Tis ten to one it maim'd you two outright.
3932	
3933	BAPTISTA	Now, in good sadness, son Petruchio,
3934	I think thou hast the veriest shrew of all.
3935	
3936	PETRUCHIO	Well, I say no: and therefore for assurance
3937	Let's each one send unto his wife;
3938	And he whose wife is most obedient
3939	To come at first when he doth send for her,
3940	Shall win the wager which we will propose.
3941	
3942	HORTENSIO	Content. What is the wager?
3943	
3944	LUCENTIO	Twenty crowns.
3945	
3946	PETRUCHIO	Twenty crowns!
3947	I'll venture so much of my hawk or hound,
3948	But twenty times so much upon my wife.
3949	
3950	LUCENTIO	A hundred then.
3951	
3952	HORTENSIO	                  Content.
3953	
3954	PETRUCHIO	A match! 'tis done.
3955	
3956	HORTENSIO	Who shall begin?
3957	
3958	LUCENTIO	                  That will I.
3959	Go, Biondello, bid your mistress come to me.
3960	
3961	BIONDELLO	I go.
3962	
3963	[Exit]
3964	
3965	BAPTISTA	Son, I'll be your half, Bianca comes.
3966	
3967	LUCENTIO	I'll have no halves; I'll bear it all myself.
3968	
3969	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
3970	
3971	How now! what news?
3972	
3973	BIONDELLO	Sir, my mistress sends you word
3974	That she is busy and she cannot come.
3975	
3976	PETRUCHIO	How! she is busy and she cannot come!
3977	Is that an answer?
3978	
3979	GREMIO	                  Ay, and a kind one too:
3980	Pray God, sir, your wife send you not a worse.
3981	
3982	PETRUCHIO	I hope better.
3983	
3984	HORTENSIO	Sirrah Biondello, go and entreat my wife
3985	To come to me forthwith.
3986	
3987	[Exit BIONDELLO]
3988	
3989	PETRUCHIO	O, ho! entreat her!
3990	Nay, then she must needs come.
3991	
3992	HORTENSIO	I am afraid, sir,
3993	Do what you can, yours will not be entreated.
3994	
3995	[Re-enter BIONDELLO]
3996	
3997	Now, where's my wife?
3998	
3999	BIONDELLO	She says you have some goodly jest in hand:
4000	She will not come: she bids you come to her.
4001	
4002	PETRUCHIO	Worse and worse; she will not come! O vile,
4003	Intolerable, not to be endured!
4004	Sirrah Grumio, go to your mistress;
4005	Say, I command her to come to me.
4006	
4007	[Exit GRUMIO]
4008	
4009	HORTENSIO	I know her answer.
4010	
4011	PETRUCHIO	                  What?
4012	
4013	HORTENSIO	She will not.
4014	
4015	PETRUCHIO	The fouler fortune mine, and there an end.
4016	
4017	BAPTISTA	Now, by my holidame, here comes Katharina!
4018	
4019	[Re-enter KATARINA]
4020	
4021	KATHARINA	What is your will, sir, that you send for me?
4022	
4023	PETRUCHIO	Where is your sister, and Hortensio's wife?
4024	
4025	KATHARINA	They sit conferring by the parlor fire.
4026	
4027	PETRUCHIO	Go fetch them hither: if they deny to come.
4028	Swinge me them soundly forth unto their husbands:
4029	Away, I say, and bring them hither straight.
4030	
4031	[Exit KATHARINA]
4032	
4033	LUCENTIO	Here is a wonder, if you talk of a wonder.
4034	
4035	HORTENSIO	And so it is: I wonder what it bodes.
4036	
4037	PETRUCHIO	Marry, peace it bodes, and love and quiet life,
4038	And awful rule and right supremacy;
4039	And, to be short, what not, that's sweet and happy?
4040	
4041	BAPTISTA	Now, fair befal thee, good Petruchio!
4042	The wager thou hast won; and I will add
4043	Unto their losses twenty thousand crowns;
4044	Another dowry to another daughter,
4045	For she is changed, as she had never been.
4046	
4047	PETRUCHIO	Nay, I will win my wager better yet
4048	And show more sign of her obedience,
4049	Her new-built virtue and obedience.
4050	See where she comes and brings your froward wives
4051	As prisoners to her womanly persuasion.
4052	
4053	[Re-enter KATHARINA, with BIANCA and Widow]
4054	
4055	Katharina, that cap of yours becomes you not:
4056	Off with that bauble, throw it under-foot.
4057	
4058	Widow	Lord, let me never have a cause to sigh,
4059	Till I be brought to such a silly pass!
4060	
4061	BIANCA	Fie! what a foolish duty call you this?
4062	
4063	LUCENTIO	I would your duty were as foolish too:
4064	The wisdom of your duty, fair Bianca,
4065	Hath cost me an hundred crowns since supper-time.
4066	
4067	BIANCA	The more fool you, for laying on my duty.
4068	
4069	PETRUCHIO	Katharina, I charge thee, tell these headstrong women
4070	What duty they do owe their lords and husbands.
4071	
4072	Widow	Come, come, you're mocking: we will have no telling.
4073	
4074	PETRUCHIO	Come on, I say; and first begin with her.
4075	
4076	Widow	She shall not.
4077	
4078	PETRUCHIO	I say she shall: and first begin with her.
4079	
4080	KATHARINA	Fie, fie! unknit that threatening unkind brow,
4081	And dart not scornful glances from those eyes,
4082	To wound thy lord, thy king, thy governor:
4083	It blots thy beauty as frosts do bite the meads,
4084	Confounds thy fame as whirlwinds shake fair buds,
4085	And in no sense is meet or amiable.
4086	A woman moved is like a fountain troubled,
4087	Muddy, ill-seeming, thick, bereft of beauty;
4088	And while it is so, none so dry or thirsty
4089	Will deign to sip or touch one drop of it.
4090	Thy husband is thy lord, thy life, thy keeper,
4091	Thy head, thy sovereign; one that cares for thee,
4092	And for thy maintenance commits his body
4093	To painful labour both by sea and land,
4094	To watch the night in storms, the day in cold,
4095	Whilst thou liest warm at home, secure and safe;
4096	And craves no other tribute at thy hands
4097	But love, fair looks and true obedience;
4098	Too little payment for so great a debt.
4099	Such duty as the subject owes the prince
4100	Even such a woman oweth to her husband;
4101	And when she is froward, peevish, sullen, sour,
4102	And not obedient to his honest will,
4103	What is she but a foul contending rebel
4104	And graceless traitor to her loving lord?
4105	I am ashamed that women are so simple
4106	To offer war where they should kneel for peace;
4107	Or seek for rule, supremacy and sway,
4108	When they are bound to serve, love and obey.
4109	Why are our bodies soft and weak and smooth,
4110	Unapt to toil and trouble in the world,
4111	But that our soft conditions and our hearts
4112	Should well agree with our external parts?
4113	Come, come, you froward and unable worms!
4114	My mind hath been as big as one of yours,
4115	My heart as great, my reason haply more,
4116	To bandy word for word and frown for frown;
4117	But now I see our lances are but straws,
4118	Our strength as weak, our weakness past compare,
4119	That seeming to be most which we indeed least are.
4120	Then vail your stomachs, for it is no boot,
4121	And place your hands below your husband's foot:
4122	In token of which duty, if he please,
4123	My hand is ready; may it do him ease.

4125	PETRUCHIO	Why, there's a wench! Come on, and kiss me, Kate.
4126	
4127	LUCENTIO	Well, go thy ways, old lad; for thou shalt ha't.
4128	
4129	VINCENTIO	'Tis a good hearing when children are toward.
4130	
4131	LUCENTIO	But a harsh hearing when women are froward.
4132	
4133	PETRUCHIO	Come, Kate, we'll to bed.
4134	We three are married, but you two are sped.
4135	
4136	[To LUCENTIO]
4137	
4138	'Twas I won the wager, though you hit the white;
4139	And, being a winner, God give you good night!
4140	
4141	[Exeunt PETRUCHIO and KATHARINA]
4142	
4143	HORTENSIO	Now, go thy ways; thou hast tamed a curst shrew.
4144	
4145	LUCENTIO	'Tis a wonder, by your leave, she will be tamed so.

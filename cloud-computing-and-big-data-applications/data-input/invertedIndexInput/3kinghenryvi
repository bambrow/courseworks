117	ACT I
118	
119	
120	
121	SCENE I	London. The Parliament-house.
122	
123	
124	[Alarum. Enter YORK, EDWARD, RICHARD, NORFOLK,
125	MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers]
126	
127	WARWICK	I wonder how the king escaped our hands.
128	
129	YORK	While we pursued the horsemen of the north,
130	He slily stole away and left his men:
131	Whereat the great Lord of Northumberland,
132	Whose warlike ears could never brook retreat,
133	Cheer'd up the drooping army; and himself,
134	Lord Clifford and Lord Stafford, all abreast,
135	Charged our main battle's front, and breaking in
136	Were by the swords of common soldiers slain.
137	
138	EDWARD	Lord Stafford's father, Duke of Buckingham,
139	Is either slain or wounded dangerously;
140	I cleft his beaver with a downright blow:
141	That this is true, father, behold his blood.
142	
143	MONTAGUE	And, brother, here's the Earl of Wiltshire's blood,
144	Whom I encounter'd as the battles join'd.
145	
146	RICHARD	Speak thou for me and tell them what I did.
147	
148	[Throwing down SOMERSET's head]
149	
150	YORK	Richard hath best deserved of all my sons.
151	But is your grace dead, my Lord of Somerset?
152	
153	NORFOLK	Such hope have all the line of John of Gaunt!
154	
155	RICHARD	Thus do I hope to shake King Henry's head.
156	
157	WARWICK	And so do I. Victorious Prince of York,
158	Before I see thee seated in that throne
159	Which now the house of Lancaster usurps,
160	I vow by heaven these eyes shall never close.
161	This is the palace of the fearful king,
162	And this the regal seat: possess it, York;
163	For this is thine and not King Henry's heirs'
164	
165	YORK	Assist me, then, sweet Warwick, and I will;
166	For hither we have broken in by force.
167	
168	NORFOLK	We'll all assist you; he that flies shall die.
169	
170	YORK	Thanks, gentle Norfolk: stay by me, my lords;
171	And, soldiers, stay and lodge by me this night.
172	
173	[They go up]
174	
175	WARWICK	And when the king comes, offer no violence,
176	Unless he seek to thrust you out perforce.
177	
178	YORK	The queen this day here holds her parliament,
179	But little thinks we shall be of her council:
180	By words or blows here let us win our right.
181	
182	RICHARD	Arm'd as we are, let's stay within this house.
183	
184	WARWICK	The bloody parliament shall this be call'd,
185	Unless Plantagenet, Duke of York, be king,
186	And bashful Henry deposed, whose cowardice
187	Hath made us by-words to our enemies.
188	
189	YORK	Then leave me not, my lords; be resolute;
190	I mean to take possession of my right.
191	
192	WARWICK	Neither the king, nor he that loves him best,
193	The proudest he that holds up Lancaster,
194	Dares stir a wing, if Warwick shake his bells.
195	I'll plant Plantagenet, root him up who dares:
196	Resolve thee, Richard; claim the English crown.
197	
198	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLIFFORD,
199	NORTHUMBERLAND, WESTMORELAND, EXETER, and the rest]
200	
201	KING HENRY VI	My lords, look where the sturdy rebel sits,
202	Even in the chair of state: belike he means,
203	Back'd by the power of Warwick, that false peer,
204	To aspire unto the crown and reign as king.
205	Earl of Northumberland, he slew thy father.
206	And thine, Lord Clifford; and you both have vow'd revenge
207	On him, his sons, his favourites and his friends.
208	
209	NORTHUMBERLAND	If I be not, heavens be revenged on me!
210	
211	CLIFFORD	The hope thereof makes Clifford mourn in steel.
212	
213	WESTMORELAND	What, shall we suffer this? let's pluck him down:
214	My heart for anger burns; I cannot brook it.
215	
216	KING HENRY VI	Be patient, gentle Earl of Westmoreland.
217	
218	CLIFFORD	Patience is for poltroons, such as he:
219	He durst not sit there, had your father lived.
220	My gracious lord, here in the parliament
221	Let us assail the family of York.
222	
223	NORTHUMBERLAND	Well hast thou spoken, cousin: be it so.
224	
225	KING HENRY VI	Ah, know you not the city favours them,
226	And they have troops of soldiers at their beck?
227	
228	EXETER	But when the duke is slain, they'll quickly fly.
229	
230	KING HENRY VI	Far be the thought of this from Henry's heart,
231	To make a shambles of the parliament-house!
232	Cousin of Exeter, frowns, words and threats
233	Shall be the war that Henry means to use.
234	Thou factious Duke of York, descend my throne,
235	and kneel for grace and mercy at my feet;
236	I am thy sovereign.
237	
238	YORK	I am thine.
239	
240	EXETER	For shame, come down: he made thee Duke of York.
241	
242	YORK	'Twas my inheritance, as the earldom was.
243	
244	EXETER	Thy father was a traitor to the crown.
245	
246	WARWICK	Exeter, thou art a traitor to the crown
247	In following this usurping Henry.
248	
249	CLIFFORD	Whom should he follow but his natural king?
250	
251	WARWICK	True, Clifford; and that's Richard Duke of York.
252	
253	KING HENRY VI	And shall I stand, and thou sit in my throne?
254	
255	YORK	It must and shall be so: content thyself.
256	
257	WARWICK	Be Duke of Lancaster; let him be king.
258	
259	WESTMORELAND	He is both king and Duke of Lancaster;
260	And that the Lord of Westmoreland shall maintain.
261	
262	WARWICK	And Warwick shall disprove it. You forget
263	That we are those which chased you from the field
264	And slew your fathers, and with colours spread
265	March'd through the city to the palace gates.
266	
267	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yes, Warwick, I remember it to my grief;
268	And, by his soul, thou and thy house shall rue it.
269	
270	WESTMORELAND	Plantagenet, of thee and these thy sons,
271	Thy kinsman and thy friends, I'll have more lives
272	Than drops of blood were in my father's veins.
273	
274	CLIFFORD	Urge it no more; lest that, instead of words,
275	I send thee, Warwick, such a messenger
276	As shall revenge his death before I stir.
277	
278	WARWICK	Poor Clifford! how I scorn his worthless threats!
279	
280	YORK	Will you we show our title to the crown?
281	If not, our swords shall plead it in the field.
282	
283	KING HENRY VI	What title hast thou, traitor, to the crown?
284	Thy father was, as thou art, Duke of York;
285	Thy grandfather, Roger Mortimer, Earl of March:
286	I am the son of Henry the Fifth,
287	Who made the Dauphin and the French to stoop
288	And seized upon their towns and provinces.
289	
290	WARWICK	Talk not of France, sith thou hast lost it all.
291	
292	KING HENRY VI	The lord protector lost it, and not I:
293	When I was crown'd I was but nine months old.
294	
295	RICHARD	You are old enough now, and yet, methinks, you lose.
296	Father, tear the crown from the usurper's head.
297	
298	EDWARD	Sweet father, do so; set it on your head.
299	
300	MONTAGUE	Good brother, as thou lovest and honourest arms,
301	Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus.
302	
303	RICHARD	Sound drums and trumpets, and the king will fly.
304	
305	YORK	Sons, peace!
306	
307	KING HENRY VI	Peace, thou! and give King Henry leave to speak.
308	
309	WARWICK	Plantagenet shall speak first: hear him, lords;
310	And be you silent and attentive too,
311	For he that interrupts him shall not live.
312	
313	KING HENRY VI	Think'st thou that I will leave my kingly throne,
314	Wherein my grandsire and my father sat?
315	No: first shall war unpeople this my realm;
316	Ay, and their colours, often borne in France,
317	And now in England to our heart's great sorrow,
318	Shall be my winding-sheet. Why faint you, lords?
319	My title's good, and better far than his.
320	
321	WARWICK	Prove it, Henry, and thou shalt be king.
322	
323	KING HENRY VI	Henry the Fourth by conquest got the crown.
324	
325	YORK	'Twas by rebellion against his king.
326	
327	KING HENRY VI	[Aside]  I know not what to say; my title's weak.--
328	Tell me, may not a king adopt an heir?
329	
330	YORK	What then?
331	
332	KING HENRY VI	An if he may, then am I lawful king;
333	For Richard, in the view of many lords,
334	Resign'd the crown to Henry the Fourth,
335	Whose heir my father was, and I am his.
336	
337	YORK	He rose against him, being his sovereign,
338	And made him to resign his crown perforce.
339	
340	WARWICK	Suppose, my lords, he did it unconstrain'd,
341	Think you 'twere prejudicial to his crown?
342	
343	EXETER	No; for he could not so resign his crown
344	But that the next heir should succeed and reign.
345	
346	KING HENRY VI	Art thou against us, Duke of Exeter?
347	
348	EXETER	His is the right, and therefore pardon me.
349	
350	YORK	Why whisper you, my lords, and answer not?
351	
352	EXETER	My conscience tells me he is lawful king.
353	
354	KING HENRY VI	[Aside]  All will revolt from me, and turn to him.
355	
356	NORTHUMBERLAND	Plantagenet, for all the claim thou lay'st,
357	Think not that Henry shall be so deposed.
358	
359	WARWICK	Deposed he shall be, in despite of all.
360	
361	NORTHUMBERLAND	Thou art deceived: 'tis not thy southern power,
362	Of Essex, Norfolk, Suffolk, nor of Kent,
363	Which makes thee thus presumptuous and proud,
364	Can set the duke up in despite of me.
365	
366	CLIFFORD	King Henry, be thy title right or wrong,
367	Lord Clifford vows to fight in thy defence:
368	May that ground gape and swallow me alive,
369	Where I shall kneel to him that slew my father!
370	
371	KING HENRY VI	O Clifford, how thy words revive my heart!
372	
373	YORK	Henry of Lancaster, resign thy crown.
374	What mutter you, or what conspire you, lords?
375	
376	WARWICK	Do right unto this princely Duke of York,
377	Or I will fill the house with armed men,
378	And over the chair of state, where now he sits,
379	Write up his title with usurping blood.
380	
381	[He stamps with his foot and the soldiers show
382	themselves]
383	
384	KING HENRY VI	My Lord of Warwick, hear me but one word:
385	Let me for this my life-time reign as king.
386	
387	YORK	Confirm the crown to me and to mine heirs,
388	And thou shalt reign in quiet while thou livest.
389	
390	KING HENRY VI	I am content: Richard Plantagenet,
391	Enjoy the kingdom after my decease.
392	
393	CLIFFORD	What wrong is this unto the prince your son!
394	
395	WARWICK	What good is this to England and himself!
396	
397	WESTMORELAND	Base, fearful and despairing Henry!
398	
399	CLIFFORD	How hast thou injured both thyself and us!
400	
401	WESTMORELAND	I cannot stay to hear these articles.
402	
403	NORTHUMBERLAND	Nor I.
404	
405	CLIFFORD	Come, cousin, let us tell the queen these news.
406	
407	WESTMORELAND	Farewell, faint-hearted and degenerate king,
408	In whose cold blood no spark of honour bides.
409	
410	NORTHUMBERLAND	Be thou a prey unto the house of York,
411	And die in bands for this unmanly deed!
412	
413	CLIFFORD	In dreadful war mayst thou be overcome,
414	Or live in peace abandon'd and despised!
415	
416	[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND, CLIFFORD, and WESTMORELAND]
417	
418	WARWICK	Turn this way, Henry, and regard them not.
419	
420	EXETER	They seek revenge and therefore will not yield.
421	
422	KING HENRY VI	Ah, Exeter!
423	
424	WARWICK	          Why should you sigh, my lord?
425	
426	KING HENRY VI	Not for myself, Lord Warwick, but my son,
427	Whom I unnaturally shall disinherit.
428	But be it as it may: I here entail
429	The crown to thee and to thine heirs for ever;
430	Conditionally, that here thou take an oath
431	To cease this civil war, and, whilst I live,
432	To honour me as thy king and sovereign,
433	And neither by treason nor hostility
434	To seek to put me down and reign thyself.
435	
436	YORK	This oath I willingly take and will perform.
437	
438	WARWICK	Long live King Henry! Plantagenet embrace him.
439	
440	KING HENRY VI	And long live thou and these thy forward sons!
441	
442	YORK	Now York and Lancaster are reconciled.
443	
444	EXETER	Accursed be he that seeks to make them foes!
445	
446	[Sennet. Here they come down]
447	
448	YORK	Farewell, my gracious lord; I'll to my castle.
449	
450	WARWICK	And I'll keep London with my soldiers.
451	
452	NORFOLK	And I to Norfolk with my followers.
453	
454	MONTAGUE	And I unto the sea from whence I came.
455	
456	[Exeunt YORK, EDWARD, EDMUND, GEORGE, RICHARD,
457	WARWICK, NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, their Soldiers, and
458	Attendants]
459	
460	KING HENRY VI	And I, with grief and sorrow, to the court.
461	
462	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]
463	
464	EXETER	Here comes the queen, whose looks bewray her anger:
465	I'll steal away.
466	
467	KING HENRY VI	                  Exeter, so will I.
468	
469	QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, go not from me; I will follow thee.
470	
471	KING HENRY VI	Be patient, gentle queen, and I will stay.
472	
473	QUEEN MARGARET	Who can be patient in such extremes?
474	Ah, wretched man! would I had died a maid
475	And never seen thee, never borne thee son,
476	Seeing thou hast proved so unnatural a father
477	Hath he deserved to lose his birthright thus?
478	Hadst thou but loved him half so well as I,
479	Or felt that pain which I did for him once,
480	Or nourish'd him as I did with my blood,
481	Thou wouldst have left thy dearest heart-blood there,
482	Rather than have that savage duke thine heir
483	And disinherited thine only son.
484	
485	PRINCE EDWARD	Father, you cannot disinherit me:
486	If you be king, why should not I succeed?
487	
488	KING HENRY VI	Pardon me, Margaret; pardon me, sweet son:
489	The Earl of Warwick and the duke enforced me.
490	
491	QUEEN MARGARET	Enforced thee! art thou king, and wilt be forced?
492	I shame to hear thee speak. Ah, timorous wretch!
493	Thou hast undone thyself, thy son and me;
494	And given unto the house of York such head
495	As thou shalt reign but by their sufferance.
496	To entail him and his heirs unto the crown,
497	What is it, but to make thy sepulchre
498	And creep into it far before thy time?
499	Warwick is chancellor and the lord of Calais;
500	Stern Falconbridge commands the narrow seas;
501	The duke is made protector of the realm;
502	And yet shalt thou be safe? such safety finds
503	The trembling lamb environed with wolves.
504	Had I been there, which am a silly woman,
505	The soldiers should have toss'd me on their pikes
506	Before I would have granted to that act.
507	But thou preferr'st thy life before thine honour:
508	And seeing thou dost, I here divorce myself
509	Both from thy table, Henry, and thy bed,
510	Until that act of parliament be repeal'd
511	Whereby my son is disinherited.
512	The northern lords that have forsworn thy colours
513	Will follow mine, if once they see them spread;
514	And spread they shall be, to thy foul disgrace
515	And utter ruin of the house of York.
516	Thus do I leave thee. Come, son, let's away;
517	Our army is ready; come, we'll after them.
518	
519	KING HENRY VI	Stay, gentle Margaret, and hear me speak.
520	
521	QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hast spoke too much already: get thee gone.
522	
523	KING HENRY VI	Gentle son Edward, thou wilt stay with me?
524	
525	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, to be murder'd by his enemies.
526	
527	PRINCE EDWARD	When I return with victory from the field
528	I'll see your grace: till then I'll follow her.
529	
530	QUEEN MARGARET	Come, son, away; we may not linger thus.
531	
532	[Exeunt QUEEN MARGARET and PRINCE EDWARD]
533	
534	KING HENRY VI	Poor queen! how love to me and to her son
535	Hath made her break out into terms of rage!
536	Revenged may she be on that hateful duke,
537	Whose haughty spirit, winged with desire,
538	Will cost my crown, and like an empty eagle
539	Tire on the flesh of me and of my son!
540	The loss of those three lords torments my heart:
541	I'll write unto them and entreat them fair.
542	Come, cousin you shall be the messenger.
543	
544	EXETER	And I, I hope, shall reconcile them all.

560	
561	[Enter RICHARD, EDWARD, and MONTAGUE]
562	
563	RICHARD	Brother, though I be youngest, give me leave.
564	
565	EDWARD	No, I can better play the orator.
566	
567	MONTAGUE	But I have reasons strong and forcible.
568	
569	[Enter YORK]
570	
571	YORK	Why, how now, sons and brother! at a strife?
572	What is your quarrel? how began it first?
573	
574	EDWARD	No quarrel, but a slight contention.
575	
576	YORK	About what?
577	
578	RICHARD	About that which concerns your grace and us;
579	The crown of England, father, which is yours.
580	
581	YORK	Mine boy? not till King Henry be dead.
582	
583	RICHARD	Your right depends not on his life or death.
584	
585	EDWARD	Now you are heir, therefore enjoy it now:
586	By giving the house of Lancaster leave to breathe,
587	It will outrun you, father, in the end.
588	
589	YORK	I took an oath that he should quietly reign.
590	
591	EDWARD	But for a kingdom any oath may be broken:
592	I would break a thousand oaths to reign one year.
593	
594	RICHARD	No; God forbid your grace should be forsworn.
595	
596	YORK	I shall be, if I claim by open war.
597	
598	RICHARD	I'll prove the contrary, if you'll hear me speak.
599	
600	YORK	Thou canst not, son; it is impossible.
601	
602	RICHARD	An oath is of no moment, being not took
603	Before a true and lawful magistrate,
604	That hath authority over him that swears:
605	Henry had none, but did usurp the place;
606	Then, seeing 'twas he that made you to depose,
607	Your oath, my lord, is vain and frivolous.
608	Therefore, to arms! And, father, do but think
609	How sweet a thing it is to wear a crown;
610	Within whose circuit is Elysium
611	And all that poets feign of bliss and joy.
612	Why do we finger thus? I cannot rest
613	Until the white rose that I wear be dyed
614	Even in the lukewarm blood of Henry's heart.
615	
616	YORK	Richard, enough; I will be king, or die.
617	Brother, thou shalt to London presently,
618	And whet on Warwick to this enterprise.
619	Thou, Richard, shalt to the Duke of Norfolk,
620	And tell him privily of our intent.
621	You Edward, shall unto my Lord Cobham,
622	With whom the Kentishmen will willingly rise:
623	In them I trust; for they are soldiers,
624	Witty, courteous, liberal, full of spirit.
625	While you are thus employ'd, what resteth more,
626	But that I seek occasion how to rise,
627	And yet the king not privy to my drift,
628	Nor any of the house of Lancaster?
629	
630	[Enter a Messenger]
631	
632	But, stay: what news? Why comest thou in such post?
633	
634	Messenger	The queen with all the northern earls and lords
635	Intend here to besiege you in your castle:
636	She is hard by with twenty thousand men;
637	And therefore fortify your hold, my lord.
638	
639	YORK	Ay, with my sword. What! think'st thou that we fear them?
640	Edward and Richard, you shall stay with me;
641	My brother Montague shall post to London:
642	Let noble Warwick, Cobham, and the rest,
643	Whom we have left protectors of the king,
644	With powerful policy strengthen themselves,
645	And trust not simple Henry nor his oaths.
646	
647	MONTAGUE	Brother, I go; I'll win them, fear it not:
648	And thus most humbly I do take my leave.
649

655	You are come to Sandal in a happy hour;
656	The army of the queen mean to besiege us.
657	
658	JOHN MORTIMER	She shall not need; we'll meet her in the field.
659	
660	YORK	What, with five thousand men?
661	
662	RICHARD	Ay, with five hundred, father, for a need:
663	A woman's general; what should we fear?
664	
665	[A march afar off]
666	
667	EDWARD	I hear their drums: let's set our men in order,
668	And issue forth and bid them battle straight.
669	
670	YORK	Five men to twenty! though the odds be great,
671	I doubt not, uncle, of our victory.
672	Many a battle have I won in France,
673	When as the enemy hath been ten to one:
674	Why should I not now have the like success?

692	
693	RUTLAND	Ah, whither shall I fly to 'scape their hands?
694	Ah, tutor, look where bloody Clifford comes!
695	
696	[Enter CLIFFORD and Soldiers]
697	
698	CLIFFORD	Chaplain, away! thy priesthood saves thy life.
699	As for the brat of this accursed duke,
700	Whose father slew my father, he shall die.
701	
702	Tutor	And I, my lord, will bear him company.
703	
704	CLIFFORD	Soldiers, away with him!
705	
706	Tutor	Ah, Clifford, murder not this innocent child,
707	Lest thou be hated both of God and man!
708	
709	[Exit, dragged off by Soldiers]
710	
711	CLIFFORD	How now! is he dead already? or is it fear
712	That makes him close his eyes? I'll open them.
713	
714	RUTLAND	So looks the pent-up lion o'er the wretch
715	That trembles under his devouring paws;
716	And so he walks, insulting o'er his prey,
717	And so he comes, to rend his limbs asunder.
718	Ah, gentle Clifford, kill me with thy sword,
719	And not with such a cruel threatening look.
720	Sweet Clifford, hear me speak before I die.
721	I am too mean a subject for thy wrath:
722	Be thou revenged on men, and let me live.
723	
724	CLIFFORD	In vain thou speak'st, poor boy; my father's blood
725	Hath stopp'd the passage where thy words should enter.
726	
727	RUTLAND	Then let my father's blood open it again:
728	He is a man, and, Clifford, cope with him.
729	
730	CLIFFORD	Had thy brethren here, their lives and thine
731	Were not revenge sufficient for me;
732	No, if I digg'd up thy forefathers' graves
733	And hung their rotten coffins up in chains,
734	It could not slake mine ire, nor ease my heart.
735	The sight of any of the house of York
736	Is as a fury to torment my soul;
737	And till I root out their accursed line
738	And leave not one alive, I live in hell.
739	Therefore--
740	
741	[Lifting his hand]
742	
743	RUTLAND	O, let me pray before I take my death!
744	To thee I pray; sweet Clifford, pity me!
745	
746	CLIFFORD	Such pity as my rapier's point affords.
747	
748	RUTLAND	I never did thee harm: why wilt thou slay me?
749	
750	CLIFFORD	Thy father hath.
751	
752	RUTLAND	                  But 'twas ere I was born.
753	Thou hast one son; for his sake pity me,
754	Lest in revenge thereof, sith God is just,
755	He be as miserably slain as I.
756	Ah, let me live in prison all my days;
757	And when I give occasion of offence,
758	Then let me die, for now thou hast no cause.
759	
760	CLIFFORD	No cause!
761	Thy father slew my father; therefore, die.
762	
763	[Stabs him]

787	
788	
789	[Alarum. Enter YORK]
790	
791	YORK	The army of the queen hath got the field:
792	My uncles both are slain in rescuing me;
793	And all my followers to the eager foe
794	Turn back and fly, like ships before the wind
795	Or lambs pursued by hunger-starved wolves.
796	My sons, God knows what hath bechanced them:
797	But this I know, they have demean'd themselves
798	Like men born to renown by life or death.
799	Three times did Richard make a lane to me.
800	And thrice cried 'Courage, father! fight it out!'
801	And full as oft came Edward to my side,
802	With purple falchion, painted to the hilt
803	In blood of those that had encounter'd him:
804	And when the hardiest warriors did retire,
805	Richard cried 'Charge! and give no foot of ground!'
806	And cried 'A crown, or else a glorious tomb!
807	A sceptre, or an earthly sepulchre!'
808	With this, we charged again: but, out, alas!
809	We bodged again; as I have seen a swan
810	With bootless labour swim against the tide
811	And spend her strength with over-matching waves.
812	
813	[A short alarum within]
814	
815	Ah, hark! the fatal followers do pursue;
816	And I am faint and cannot fly their fury:
817	And were I strong, I would not shun their fury:
818	The sands are number'd that make up my life;
819	Here must I stay, and here my life must end.
820	
821	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET, CLIFFORD, NORTHUMBERLAND,
822	PRINCE EDWARD, and Soldiers]
823	
824	Come, bloody Clifford, rough Northumberland,
825	I dare your quenchless fury to more rage:
826	I am your butt, and I abide your shot.
827	
828	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yield to our mercy, proud Plantagenet.
829	
830	CLIFFORD	Ay, to such mercy as his ruthless arm,
831	With downright payment, show'd unto my father.
832	Now Phaethon hath tumbled from his car,
833	And made an evening at the noontide prick.
834	
835	YORK	My ashes, as the phoenix, may bring forth
836	A bird that will revenge upon you all:
837	And in that hope I throw mine eyes to heaven,
838	Scorning whate'er you can afflict me with.
839	Why come you not? what! multitudes, and fear?
840	
841	CLIFFORD	So cowards fight when they can fly no further;
842	So doves do peck the falcon's piercing talons;
843	So desperate thieves, all hopeless of their lives,
844	Breathe out invectives 'gainst the officers.
845	
846	YORK	O Clifford, but bethink thee once again,
847	And in thy thought o'er-run my former time;
848	And, if though canst for blushing, view this face,
849	And bite thy tongue, that slanders him with cowardice
850	Whose frown hath made thee faint and fly ere this!
851	
852	CLIFFORD	I will not bandy with thee word for word,
853	But buckle with thee blows, twice two for one.
854	
855	QUEEN MARGARET	Hold, valiant Clifford! for a thousand causes
856	I would prolong awhile the traitor's life.
857	Wrath makes him deaf: speak thou, Northumberland.
858	
859	NORTHUMBERLAND	Hold, Clifford! do not honour him so much
860	To prick thy finger, though to wound his heart:
861	What valour were it, when a cur doth grin,
862	For one to thrust his hand between his teeth,
863	When he might spurn him with his foot away?
864	It is war's prize to take all vantages;
865	And ten to one is no impeach of valour.
866	
867	[They lay hands on YORK, who struggles]
868	
869	CLIFFORD	Ay, ay, so strives the woodcock with the gin.
870	
871	NORTHUMBERLAND	So doth the cony struggle in the net.
872	
873	YORK	So triumph thieves upon their conquer'd booty;
874	So true men yield, with robbers so o'ermatch'd.
875	
876	NORTHUMBERLAND	What would your grace have done unto him now?
877	
878	QUEEN MARGARET	Brave warriors, Clifford and Northumberland,
879	Come, make him stand upon this molehill here,
880	That raught at mountains with outstretched arms,
881	Yet parted but the shadow with his hand.
882	What! was it you that would be England's king?
883	Was't you that revell'd in our parliament,
884	And made a preachment of your high descent?
885	Where are your mess of sons to back you now?
886	The wanton Edward, and the lusty George?
887	And where's that valiant crook-back prodigy,
888	Dicky your boy, that with his grumbling voice
889	Was wont to cheer his dad in mutinies?
890	Or, with the rest, where is your darling Rutland?
891	Look, York: I stain'd this napkin with the blood
892	That valiant Clifford, with his rapier's point,
893	Made issue from the bosom of the boy;
894	And if thine eyes can water for his death,
895	I give thee this to dry thy cheeks withal.
896	Alas poor York! but that I hate thee deadly,
897	I should lament thy miserable state.
898	I prithee, grieve, to make me merry, York.
899	What, hath thy fiery heart so parch'd thine entrails
900	That not a tear can fall for Rutland's death?
901	Why art thou patient, man? thou shouldst be mad;
902	And I, to make thee mad, do mock thee thus.
903	Stamp, rave, and fret, that I may sing and dance.
904	Thou wouldst be fee'd, I see, to make me sport:
905	York cannot speak, unless he wear a crown.
906	A crown for York! and, lords, bow low to him:
907	Hold you his hands, whilst I do set it on.
908	
909	[Putting a paper crown on his head]
910	
911	Ay, marry, sir, now looks he like a king!
912	Ay, this is he that took King Henry's chair,
913	And this is he was his adopted heir.
914	But how is it that great Plantagenet
915	Is crown'd so soon, and broke his solemn oath?
916	As I bethink me, you should not be king
917	Till our King Henry had shook hands with death.
918	And will you pale your head in Henry's glory,
919	And rob his temples of the diadem,
920	Now in his life, against your holy oath?
921	O, 'tis a fault too too unpardonable!
922	Off with the crown, and with the crown his head;
923	And, whilst we breathe, take time to do him dead.
924	
925	CLIFFORD	That is my office, for my father's sake.
926	
927	QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, stay; lets hear the orisons he makes.
928	
929	YORK	She-wolf of France, but worse than wolves of France,
930	Whose tongue more poisons than the adder's tooth!
931	How ill-beseeming is it in thy sex
932	To triumph, like an Amazonian trull,
933	Upon their woes whom fortune captivates!
934	But that thy face is, vizard-like, unchanging,
935	Made impudent with use of evil deeds,
936	I would assay, proud queen, to make thee blush.
937	To tell thee whence thou camest, of whom derived,
938	Were shame enough to shame thee, wert thou not shameless.
939	Thy father bears the type of King of Naples,
940	Of both the Sicils and Jerusalem,
941	Yet not so wealthy as an English yeoman.
942	Hath that poor monarch taught thee to insult?
943	It needs not, nor it boots thee not, proud queen,
944	Unless the adage must be verified,
945	That beggars mounted run their horse to death.
946	'Tis beauty that doth oft make women proud;
947	But, God he knows, thy share thereof is small:
948	'Tis virtue that doth make them most admired;
949	The contrary doth make thee wonder'd at:
950	'Tis government that makes them seem divine;
951	The want thereof makes thee abominable:
952	Thou art as opposite to every good
953	As the Antipodes are unto us,
954	Or as the south to the septentrion.
955	O tiger's heart wrapt in a woman's hide!
956	How couldst thou drain the life-blood of the child,
957	To bid the father wipe his eyes withal,
958	And yet be seen to bear a woman's face?
959	Women are soft, mild, pitiful and flexible;
960	Thou stern, obdurate, flinty, rough, remorseless.
961	Bids't thou me rage? why, now thou hast thy wish:
962	Wouldst have me weep? why, now thou hast thy will:
963	For raging wind blows up incessant showers,
964	And when the rage allays, the rain begins.
965	These tears are my sweet Rutland's obsequies:
966	And every drop cries vengeance for his death,
967	'Gainst thee, fell Clifford, and thee, false
968	Frenchwoman.
969	
970	NORTHUMBERLAND	Beshrew me, but his passion moves me so
971	That hardly can I cheque my eyes from tears.
972	
973	YORK	That face of his the hungry cannibals
974	Would not have touch'd, would not have stain'd with blood:
975	But you are more inhuman, more inexorable,
976	O, ten times more, than tigers of Hyrcania.
977	See, ruthless queen, a hapless father's tears:
978	This cloth thou dip'dst in blood of my sweet boy,
979	And I with tears do wash the blood away.
980	Keep thou the napkin, and go boast of this:
981	And if thou tell'st the heavy story right,
982	Upon my soul, the hearers will shed tears;
983	Yea even my foes will shed fast-falling tears,
984	And say 'Alas, it was a piteous deed!'
985	There, take the crown, and, with the crown, my curse;
986	And in thy need such comfort come to thee
987	As now I reap at thy too cruel hand!
988	Hard-hearted Clifford, take me from the world:
989	My soul to heaven, my blood upon your heads!
990	
991	NORTHUMBERLAND	Had he been slaughter-man to all my kin,
992	I should not for my life but weep with him.
993	To see how inly sorrow gripes his soul.
994	
995	QUEEN MARGARET	What, weeping-ripe, my Lord Northumberland?
996	Think but upon the wrong he did us all,
997	And that will quickly dry thy melting tears.
998	
999	CLIFFORD	Here's for my oath, here's for my father's death.
1000	
1001	[Stabbing him]

1028	SCENE I	A plain near Mortimer's Cross in Herefordshire.
1029	
1030	
1031	[A march. Enter EDWARD, RICHARD, and their power]
1032	
1033	EDWARD	I wonder how our princely father 'scaped,
1034	Or whether he be 'scaped away or no
1035	From Clifford's and Northumberland's pursuit:
1036	Had he been ta'en, we should have heard the news;
1037	Had he been slain, we should have heard the news;
1038	Or had he 'scaped, methinks we should have heard
1039	The happy tidings of his good escape.
1040	How fares my brother? why is he so sad?
1041	
1042	RICHARD	I cannot joy, until I be resolved
1043	Where our right valiant father is become.
1044	I saw him in the battle range about;
1045	And watch'd him how he singled Clifford forth.
1046	Methought he bore him in the thickest troop
1047	As doth a lion in a herd of neat;
1048	Or as a bear, encompass'd round with dogs,
1049	Who having pinch'd a few and made them cry,
1050	The rest stand all aloof, and bark at him.
1051	So fared our father with his enemies;
1052	So fled his enemies my warlike father:
1053	Methinks, 'tis prize enough to be his son.
1054	See how the morning opes her golden gates,
1055	And takes her farewell of the glorious sun!
1056	How well resembles it the prime of youth,
1057	Trimm'd like a younker prancing to his love!
1058	
1059	EDWARD	Dazzle mine eyes, or do I see three suns?
1060	
1061	RICHARD	Three glorious suns, each one a perfect sun;
1062	Not separated with the racking clouds,
1063	But sever'd in a pale clear-shining sky.
1064	See, see! they join, embrace, and seem to kiss,
1065	As if they vow'd some league inviolable:
1066	Now are they but one lamp, one light, one sun.
1067	In this the heaven figures some event.
1068	
1069	EDWARD	'Tis wondrous strange, the like yet never heard of.
1070	I think it cites us, brother, to the field,
1071	That we, the sons of brave Plantagenet,
1072	Each one already blazing by our meeds,
1073	Should notwithstanding join our lights together
1074	And over-shine the earth as this the world.
1075	Whate'er it bodes, henceforward will I bear
1076	Upon my target three fair-shining suns.
1077	
1078	RICHARD	Nay, bear three daughters: by your leave I speak it,
1079	You love the breeder better than the male.
1080	
1081	[Enter a Messenger]
1082	
1083	But what art thou, whose heavy looks foretell
1084	Some dreadful story hanging on thy tongue?
1085	
1086	Messenger	Ah, one that was a woful looker-on
1087	When as the noble Duke of York was slain,
1088	Your princely father and my loving lord!
1089	
1090	EDWARD	O, speak no more, for I have heard too much.
1091	
1092	RICHARD	Say how he died, for I will hear it all.
1093	
1094	Messenger	Environed he was with many foes,
1095	And stood against them, as the hope of Troy
1096	Against the Greeks that would have enter'd Troy.
1097	But Hercules himself must yield to odds;
1098	And many strokes, though with a little axe,
1099	Hew down and fell the hardest-timber'd oak.
1100	By many hands your father was subdued;
1101	But only slaughter'd by the ireful arm
1102	Of unrelenting Clifford and the queen,
1103	Who crown'd the gracious duke in high despite,
1104	Laugh'd in his face; and when with grief he wept,
1105	The ruthless queen gave him to dry his cheeks
1106	A napkin steeped in the harmless blood
1107	Of sweet young Rutland, by rough Clifford slain:
1108	And after many scorns, many foul taunts,
1109	They took his head, and on the gates of York
1110	They set the same; and there it doth remain,
1111	The saddest spectacle that e'er I view'd.
1112	
1113	EDWARD	Sweet Duke of York, our prop to lean upon,
1114	Now thou art gone, we have no staff, no stay.
1115	O Clifford, boisterous Clifford! thou hast slain
1116	The flower of Europe for his chivalry;
1117	And treacherously hast thou vanquish'd him,
1118	For hand to hand he would have vanquish'd thee.
1119	Now my soul's palace is become a prison:
1120	Ah, would she break from hence, that this my body
1121	Might in the ground be closed up in rest!
1122	For never henceforth shall I joy again,
1123	Never, O never shall I see more joy!
1124	
1125	RICHARD	 I cannot weep; for all my body's moisture
1126	Scarce serves to quench my furnace-burning heart:
1127	Nor can my tongue unload my heart's great burthen;
1128	For selfsame wind that I should speak withal
1129	Is kindling coals that fires all my breast,
1130	And burns me up with flames that tears would quench.
1131	To weep is to make less the depth of grief:
1132	Tears then for babes; blows and revenge for me
1133	Richard, I bear thy name; I'll venge thy death,
1134	Or die renowned by attempting it.
1135	
1136	EDWARD	His name that valiant duke hath left with thee;
1137	His dukedom and his chair with me is left.
1138	
1139	RICHARD	Nay, if thou be that princely eagle's bird,
1140	Show thy descent by gazing 'gainst the sun:
1141	For chair and dukedom, throne and kingdom say;
1142	Either that is thine, or else thou wert not his.
1143	
1144	[March. Enter WARWICK, MONTAGUE, and their army]
1145	
1146	WARWICK	How now, fair lords! What fare? what news abroad?
1147	
1148	RICHARD	Great Lord of Warwick, if we should recount
1149	Our baleful news, and at each word's deliverance
1150	Stab poniards in our flesh till all were told,
1151	The words would add more anguish than the wounds.
1152	O valiant lord, the Duke of York is slain!
1153	
1154	EDWARD	O Warwick, Warwick! that Plantagenet,
1155	Which held three dearly as his soul's redemption,
1156	Is by the stern Lord Clifford done to death.
1157	
1158	WARWICK	Ten days ago I drown'd these news in tears;
1159	And now, to add more measure to your woes,
1160	I come to tell you things sith then befall'n.
1161	After the bloody fray at Wakefield fought,
1162	Where your brave father breathed his latest gasp,
1163	Tidings, as swiftly as the posts could run,
1164	Were brought me of your loss and his depart.
1165	I, then in London keeper of the king,
1166	Muster'd my soldiers, gather'd flocks of friends,
1167	And very well appointed, as I thought,
1168	March'd toward Saint Alban's to intercept the queen,
1169	Bearing the king in my behalf along;
1170	For by my scouts I was advertised
1171	That she was coming with a full intent
1172	To dash our late decree in parliament
1173	Touching King Henry's oath and your succession.
1174	Short tale to make, we at Saint Alban's met
1175	Our battles join'd, and both sides fiercely fought:
1176	But whether 'twas the coldness of the king,
1177	Who look'd full gently on his warlike queen,
1178	That robb'd my soldiers of their heated spleen;
1179	Or whether 'twas report of her success;
1180	Or more than common fear of Clifford's rigour,
1181	Who thunders to his captives blood and death,
1182	I cannot judge: but to conclude with truth,
1183	Their weapons like to lightning came and went;
1184	Our soldiers', like the night-owl's lazy flight,
1185	Or like an idle thresher with a flail,
1186	Fell gently down, as if they struck their friends.
1187	I cheer'd them up with justice of our cause,
1188	With promise of high pay and great rewards:
1189	But all in vain; they had no heart to fight,
1190	And we in them no hope to win the day;
1191	So that we fled; the king unto the queen;
1192	Lord George your brother, Norfolk and myself,
1193	In haste, post-haste, are come to join with you:
1194	For in the marches here we heard you were,
1195	Making another head to fight again.
1196	
1197	EDWARD	Where is the Duke of Norfolk, gentle Warwick?
1198	And when came George from Burgundy to England?
1199	
1200	WARWICK	Some six miles off the duke is with the soldiers;
1201	And for your brother, he was lately sent
1202	From your kind aunt, Duchess of Burgundy,
1203	With aid of soldiers to this needful war.
1204	
1205	RICHARD	'Twas odds, belike, when valiant Warwick fled:
1206	Oft have I heard his praises in pursuit,
1207	But ne'er till now his scandal of retire.
1208	
1209	WARWICK	Nor now my scandal, Richard, dost thou hear;
1210	For thou shalt know this strong right hand of mine
1211	Can pluck the diadem from faint Henry's head,
1212	And wring the awful sceptre from his fist,
1213	Were he as famous and as bold in war
1214	As he is famed for mildness, peace, and prayer.
1215	
1216	RICHARD	I know it well, Lord Warwick; blame me not:
1217	'Tis love I bear thy glories makes me speak.
1218	But in this troublous time what's to be done?
1219	Shall we go throw away our coats of steel,
1220	And wrap our bodies in black mourning gowns,
1221	Numbering our Ave-Maries with our beads?
1222	Or shall we on the helmets of our foes
1223	Tell our devotion with revengeful arms?
1224	If for the last, say ay, and to it, lords.
1225	
1226	WARWICK	Why, therefore Warwick came to seek you out;
1227	And therefore comes my brother Montague.
1228	Attend me, lords. The proud insulting queen,
1229	With Clifford and the haught Northumberland,
1230	And of their feather many more proud birds,
1231	Have wrought the easy-melting king like wax.
1232	He swore consent to your succession,
1233	His oath enrolled in the parliament;
1234	And now to London all the crew are gone,
1235	To frustrate both his oath and what beside
1236	May make against the house of Lancaster.
1237	Their power, I think, is thirty thousand strong:
1238	Now, if the help of Norfolk and myself,
1239	With all the friends that thou, brave Earl of March,
1240	Amongst the loving Welshmen canst procure,
1241	Will but amount to five and twenty thousand,
1242	Why, Via! to London will we march amain,
1243	And once again bestride our foaming steeds,
1244	And once again cry 'Charge upon our foes!'
1245	But never once again turn back and fly.
1246	
1247	RICHARD	Ay, now methinks I hear great Warwick speak:
1248	Ne'er may he live to see a sunshine day,
1249	That cries 'Retire,' if Warwick bid him stay.
1250	
1251	EDWARD	Lord Warwick, on thy shoulder will I lean;
1252	And when thou fail'st--as God forbid the hour!--
1253	Must Edward fall, which peril heaven forfend!
1254	
1255	WARWICK	No longer Earl of March, but Duke of York:
1256	The next degree is England's royal throne;
1257	For King of England shalt thou be proclaim'd
1258	In every borough as we pass along;
1259	And he that throws not up his cap for joy
1260	Shall for the fault make forfeit of his head.
1261	King Edward, valiant Richard, Montague,
1262	Stay we no longer, dreaming of renown,
1263	But sound the trumpets, and about our task.
1264	
1265	RICHARD	Then, Clifford, were thy heart as hard as steel,
1266	As thou hast shown it flinty by thy deeds,
1267	I come to pierce it, or to give thee mine.
1268	
1269	EDWARD	Then strike up drums: God and Saint George for us!
1270	
1271	[Enter a Messenger]
1272	
1273	WARWICK	How now! what news?
1274	
1275	Messenger	The Duke of Norfolk sends you word by me,
1276	The queen is coming with a puissant host;
1277	And craves your company for speedy counsel.

1289	ACT II
1290	
1291	
1292	
1293	SCENE II	Before York.
1294	
1295	
1296	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET,
1297	PRINCE EDWARD, CLIFFORD, and NORTHUMBERLAND, with
1298	drum and trumpets]
1299	
1300	QUEEN MARGARET	Welcome, my lord, to this brave town of York.
1301	Yonder's the head of that arch-enemy
1302	That sought to be encompass'd with your crown:
1303	Doth not the object cheer your heart, my lord?
1304	
1305	KING HENRY VI	Ay, as the rocks cheer them that fear their wreck:
1306	To see this sight, it irks my very soul.
1307	Withhold revenge, dear God! 'tis not my fault,
1308	Nor wittingly have I infringed my vow.
1309	
1310	CLIFFORD	My gracious liege, this too much lenity
1311	And harmful pity must be laid aside.
1312	To whom do lions cast their gentle looks?
1313	Not to the beast that would usurp their den.
1314	Whose hand is that the forest bear doth lick?
1315	Not his that spoils her young before her face.
1316	Who 'scapes the lurking serpent's mortal sting?
1317	Not he that sets his foot upon her back.
1318	The smallest worm will turn being trodden on,
1319	And doves will peck in safeguard of their brood.
1320	Ambitious York doth level at thy crown,
1321	Thou smiling while he knit his angry brows:
1322	He, but a duke, would have his son a king,
1323	And raise his issue, like a loving sire;
1324	Thou, being a king, blest with a goodly son,
1325	Didst yield consent to disinherit him,
1326	Which argued thee a most unloving father.
1327	Unreasonable creatures feed their young;
1328	And though man's face be fearful to their eyes,
1329	Yet, in protection of their tender ones,
1330	Who hath not seen them, even with those wings
1331	Which sometime they have used with fearful flight,
1332	Make war with him that climb'd unto their nest,
1333	Offer their own lives in their young's defence?
1334	For shame, my liege, make them your precedent!
1335	Were it not pity that this goodly boy
1336	Should lose his birthright by his father's fault,
1337	And long hereafter say unto his child,
1338	'What my great-grandfather and his grandsire got
1339	My careless father fondly gave away'?
1340	Ah, what a shame were this! Look on the boy;
1341	And let his manly face, which promiseth
1342	Successful fortune, steel thy melting heart
1343	To hold thine own and leave thine own with him.
1344	
1345	KING HENRY VI	Full well hath Clifford play'd the orator,
1346	Inferring arguments of mighty force.
1347	But, Clifford, tell me, didst thou never hear
1348	That things ill-got had ever bad success?
1349	And happy always was it for that son
1350	Whose father for his hoarding went to hell?
1351	I'll leave my son my virtuous deeds behind;
1352	And would my father had left me no more!
1353	For all the rest is held at such a rate
1354	As brings a thousand-fold more care to keep
1355	Than in possession and jot of pleasure.
1356	Ah, cousin York! would thy best friends did know
1357	How it doth grieve me that thy head is here!
1358	
1359	QUEEN MARGARET	My lord, cheer up your spirits: our foes are nigh,
1360	And this soft courage makes your followers faint.
1361	You promised knighthood to our forward son:
1362	Unsheathe your sword, and dub him presently.
1363	Edward, kneel down.
1364	
1365	KING HENRY VI	Edward Plantagenet, arise a knight;
1366	And learn this lesson, draw thy sword in right.
1367	
1368	PRINCE	My gracious father, by your kingly leave,
1369	I'll draw it as apparent to the crown,
1370	And in that quarrel use it to the death.
1371	
1372	CLIFFORD	Why, that is spoken like a toward prince.
1373	
1374	[Enter a Messenger]
1375	
1376	Messenger	Royal commanders, be in readiness:
1377	For with a band of thirty thousand men
1378	Comes Warwick, backing of the Duke of York;
1379	And in the towns, as they do march along,
1380	Proclaims him king, and many fly to him:
1381	Darraign your battle, for they are at hand.
1382	
1383	CLIFFORD	I would your highness would depart the field:
1384	The queen hath best success when you are absent.
1385	
1386	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, good my lord, and leave us to our fortune.
1387	
1388	KING HENRY VI	Why, that's my fortune too; therefore I'll stay.
1389	
1390	NORTHUMBERLAND	Be it with resolution then to fight.
1391	
1392	PRINCE EDWARD	My royal father, cheer these noble lords
1393	And hearten those that fight in your defence:
1394	Unsheathe your sword, good father; cry 'Saint George!'
1395	
1396	[March. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD, WARWICK,
1397	NORFOLK, MONTAGUE, and Soldiers]
1398	
1399	EDWARD	Now, perjured Henry! wilt thou kneel for grace,
1400	And set thy diadem upon my head;
1401	Or bide the mortal fortune of the field?
1402	
1403	QUEEN MARGARET	Go, rate thy minions, proud insulting boy!
1404	Becomes it thee to be thus bold in terms
1405	Before thy sovereign and thy lawful king?
1406	
1407	EDWARD	I am his king, and he should bow his knee;
1408	I was adopted heir by his consent:
1409	Since when, his oath is broke; for, as I hear,
1410	You, that are king, though he do wear the crown,
1411	Have caused him, by new act of parliament,
1412	To blot out me, and put his own son in.
1413	
1414	CLIFFORD	And reason too:
1415	Who should succeed the father but the son?
1416	
1417	RICHARD	Are you there, butcher? O, I cannot speak!
1418	
1419	CLIFFORD	Ay, crook-back, here I stand to answer thee,
1420	Or any he the proudest of thy sort.
1421	
1422	RICHARD	'Twas you that kill'd young Rutland, was it not?
1423	
1424	CLIFFORD	Ay, and old York, and yet not satisfied.
1425	
1426	RICHARD	For God's sake, lords, give signal to the fight.
1427	
1428	WARWICK	What say'st thou, Henry, wilt thou yield the crown?
1429	
1430	QUEEN MARGARET	Why, how now, long-tongued Warwick! dare you speak?
1431	When you and I met at Saint Alban's last,
1432	Your legs did better service than your hands.
1433	
1434	WARWICK	Then 'twas my turn to fly, and now 'tis thine.
1435	
1436	CLIFFORD	You said so much before, and yet you fled.
1437	
1438	WARWICK	'Twas not your valour, Clifford, drove me thence.
1439	
1440	NORTHUMBERLAND	No, nor your manhood that durst make you stay.
1441	
1442	RICHARD	Northumberland, I hold thee reverently.
1443	Break off the parley; for scarce I can refrain
1444	The execution of my big-swoln heart
1445	Upon that Clifford, that cruel child-killer.
1446	
1447	CLIFFORD	I slew thy father, call'st thou him a child?
1448	
1449	RICHARD	Ay, like a dastard and a treacherous coward,
1450	As thou didst kill our tender brother Rutland;
1451	But ere sunset I'll make thee curse the deed.
1452	
1453	KING HENRY VI	Have done with words, my lords, and hear me speak.
1454	
1455	QUEEN MARGARET	Defy them then, or else hold close thy lips.
1456	
1457	KING HENRY VI	I prithee, give no limits to my tongue:
1458	I am a king, and privileged to speak.
1459	
1460	CLIFFORD	My liege, the wound that bred this meeting here
1461	Cannot be cured by words; therefore be still.
1462	
1463	RICHARD	Then, executioner, unsheathe thy sword:
1464	By him that made us all, I am resolved
1465	that Clifford's manhood lies upon his tongue.
1466	
1467	EDWARD	Say, Henry, shall I have my right, or no?
1468	A thousand men have broke their fasts to-day,
1469	That ne'er shall dine unless thou yield the crown.
1470	
1471	WARWICK	If thou deny, their blood upon thy head;
1472	For York in justice puts his armour on.
1473	
1474	PRINCE EDWARD	If that be right which Warwick says is right,
1475	There is no wrong, but every thing is right.
1476	
1477	RICHARD	Whoever got thee, there thy mother stands;
1478	For, well I wot, thou hast thy mother's tongue.
1479	
1480	QUEEN MARGARET	But thou art neither like thy sire nor dam;
1481	But like a foul mis-shapen stigmatic,
1482	Mark'd by the destinies to be avoided,
1483	As venom toads, or lizards' dreadful stings.
1484	
1485	RICHARD	Iron of Naples hid with English gilt,
1486	Whose father bears the title of a king,--
1487	As if a channel should be call'd the sea,--
1488	Shamest thou not, knowing whence thou art extraught,
1489	To let thy tongue detect thy base-born heart?
1490	
1491	EDWARD	A wisp of straw were worth a thousand crowns,
1492	To make this shameless callet know herself.
1493	Helen of Greece was fairer far than thou,
1494	Although thy husband may be Menelaus;
1495	And ne'er was Agamemnon's brother wrong'd
1496	By that false woman, as this king by thee.
1497	His father revell'd in the heart of France,
1498	And tamed the king, and made the dauphin stoop;
1499	And had he match'd according to his state,
1500	He might have kept that glory to this day;
1501	But when he took a beggar to his bed,
1502	And graced thy poor sire with his bridal-day,
1503	Even then that sunshine brew'd a shower for him,
1504	That wash'd his father's fortunes forth of France,
1505	And heap'd sedition on his crown at home.
1506	For what hath broach'd this tumult but thy pride?
1507	Hadst thou been meek, our title still had slept;
1508	And we, in pity of the gentle king,
1509	Had slipp'd our claim until another age.
1510	
1511	GEORGE	But when we saw our sunshine made thy spring,
1512	And that thy summer bred us no increase,
1513	We set the axe to thy usurping root;
1514	And though the edge hath something hit ourselves,
1515	Yet, know thou, since we have begun to strike,
1516	We'll never leave till we have hewn thee down,
1517	Or bathed thy growing with our heated bloods.
1518	
1519	EDWARD	And, in this resolution, I defy thee;
1520	Not willing any longer conference,
1521	Since thou deniest the gentle king to speak.
1522	Sound trumpets! let our bloody colours wave!
1523	And either victory, or else a grave.
1524	
1525	QUEEN MARGARET	Stay, Edward.
1526	
1527	EDWARD	No, wrangling woman, we'll no longer stay:
1528	These words will cost ten thousand lives this day.

1547	
1548	WARWICK	Forspent with toil, as runners with a race,
1549	I lay me down a little while to breathe;
1550	For strokes received, and many blows repaid,
1551	Have robb'd my strong-knit sinews of their strength,
1552	And spite of spite needs must I rest awhile.
1553	
1554	[Enter EDWARD, running]

1560	
1561	[Enter GEORGE]
1562	
1563	GEORGE	Our hap is loss, our hope but sad despair;
1564	Our ranks are broke, and ruin follows us:

1568	And weak we are and cannot shun pursuit.
1569	
1570	[Enter RICHARD]
1571	
1572	RICHARD	Ah, Warwick, why hast thou withdrawn thyself?
1573	Thy brother's blood the thirsty earth hath drunk,
1574	Broach'd with the steely point of Clifford's lance;
1575	And in the very pangs of death he cried,
1576	Like to a dismal clangour heard from far,
1577	'Warwick, revenge! brother, revenge my death!'
1578	So, underneath the belly of their steeds,
1579	That stain'd their fetlocks in his smoking blood,
1580	The noble gentleman gave up the ghost.
1581	
1582	WARWICK	Then let the earth be drunken with our blood:
1583	I'll kill my horse, because I will not fly.
1584	Why stand we like soft-hearted women here,
1585	Wailing our losses, whiles the foe doth rage;
1586	And look upon, as if the tragedy
1587	Were play'd in jest by counterfeiting actors?
1588	Here on my knee I vow to God above,
1589	I'll never pause again, never stand still,
1590	Till either death hath closed these eyes of mine
1591	Or fortune given me measure of revenge.
1592	
1593	EDWARD	O Warwick, I do bend my knee with thine;
1594	And in this vow do chain my soul to thine!
1595	And, ere my knee rise from the earth's cold face,
1596	I throw my hands, mine eyes, my heart to thee,
1597	Thou setter up and plucker down of kings,
1598	Beseeching thee, if with they will it stands
1599	That to my foes this body must be prey,
1600	Yet that thy brazen gates of heaven may ope,
1601	And give sweet passage to my sinful soul!
1602	Now, lords, take leave until we meet again,
1603	Where'er it be, in heaven or in earth.
1604	
1605	RICHARD	Brother, give me thy hand; and, gentle Warwick,
1606	Let me embrace thee in my weary arms:
1607	I, that did never weep, now melt with woe
1608	That winter should cut off our spring-time so.
1609	
1610	WARWICK	Away, away! Once more, sweet lords farewell.
1611	
1612	GEORGE	Yet let us all together to our troops,
1613	And give them leave to fly that will not stay;
1614	And call them pillars that will stand to us;

1616	As victors wear at the Olympian games:

1636	[Excursions. Enter RICHARD and CLIFFORD]
1637	
1638	RICHARD	Now, Clifford, I have singled thee alone:
1639	Suppose this arm is for the Duke of York,
1640	And this for Rutland; both bound to revenge,
1641	Wert thou environ'd with a brazen wall.
1642	
1643	CLIFFORD	Now, Richard, I am with thee here alone:
1644	This is the hand that stabb'd thy father York;
1645	And this the hand that slew thy brother Rutland;
1646	And here's the heart that triumphs in their death
1647	And cheers these hands that slew thy sire and brother
1648	To execute the like upon thyself;
1649	And so, have at thee!
1650	
1651	[They fight. WARWICK comes; CLIFFORD flies]

1670	
1671	[Alarum. Enter KING HENRY VI alone]
1672	
1673	KING HENRY VI	This battle fares like to the morning's war,
1674	When dying clouds contend with growing light,
1675	What time the shepherd, blowing of his nails,
1676	Can neither call it perfect day nor night.
1677	Now sways it this way, like a mighty sea
1678	Forced by the tide to combat with the wind;
1679	Now sways it that way, like the selfsame sea
1680	Forced to retire by fury of the wind:
1681	Sometime the flood prevails, and then the wind;
1682	Now one the better, then another best;
1683	Both tugging to be victors, breast to breast,
1684	Yet neither conqueror nor conquered:
1685	So is the equal of this fell war.
1686	Here on this molehill will I sit me down.
1687	To whom God will, there be the victory!
1688	For Margaret my queen, and Clifford too,
1689	Have chid me from the battle; swearing both
1690	They prosper best of all when I am thence.
1691	Would I were dead! if God's good will were so;
1692	For what is in this world but grief and woe?
1693	O God! methinks it were a happy life,
1694	To be no better than a homely swain;
1695	To sit upon a hill, as I do now,
1696	To carve out dials quaintly, point by point,
1697	Thereby to see the minutes how they run,
1698	How many make the hour full complete;
1699	How many hours bring about the day;
1700	How many days will finish up the year;
1701	How many years a mortal man may live.
1702	When this is known, then to divide the times:
1703	So many hours must I tend my flock;
1704	So many hours must I take my rest;
1705	So many hours must I contemplate;
1706	So many hours must I sport myself;
1707	So many days my ewes have been with young;
1708	So many weeks ere the poor fools will ean:
1709	So many years ere I shall shear the fleece:
1710	So minutes, hours, days, months, and years,
1711	Pass'd over to the end they were created,
1712	Would bring white hairs unto a quiet grave.
1713	Ah, what a life were this! how sweet! how lovely!
1714	Gives not the hawthorn-bush a sweeter shade
1715	To shepherds looking on their silly sheep,
1716	Than doth a rich embroider'd canopy
1717	To kings that fear their subjects' treachery?
1718	O, yes, it doth; a thousand-fold it doth.
1719	And to conclude, the shepherd's homely curds,
1720	His cold thin drink out of his leather bottle.
1721	His wonted sleep under a fresh tree's shade,
1722	All which secure and sweetly he enjoys,
1723	Is far beyond a prince's delicates,
1724	His viands sparkling in a golden cup,
1725	His body couched in a curious bed,
1726	When care, mistrust, and treason waits on him.
1727	
1728	[Alarum. Enter a Son that has killed his father,
1729	dragging in the dead body]
1730	
1731	Son	Ill blows the wind that profits nobody.
1732	This man, whom hand to hand I slew in fight,
1733	May be possessed with some store of crowns;
1734	And I, that haply take them from him now,
1735	May yet ere night yield both my life and them
1736	To some man else, as this dead man doth me.
1737	Who's this? O God! it is my father's face,
1738	Whom in this conflict I unwares have kill'd.
1739	O heavy times, begetting such events!
1740	From London by the king was I press'd forth;
1741	My father, being the Earl of Warwick's man,
1742	Came on the part of York, press'd by his master;
1743	And I, who at his hands received my life, him
1744	Have by my hands of life bereaved him.
1745	Pardon me, God, I knew not what I did!
1746	And pardon, father, for I knew not thee!
1747	My tears shall wipe away these bloody marks;
1748	And no more words till they have flow'd their fill.
1749	
1750	KING HENRY VI	O piteous spectacle! O bloody times!
1751	Whiles lions war and battle for their dens,
1752	Poor harmless lambs abide their enmity.
1753	Weep, wretched man, I'll aid thee tear for tear;
1754	And let our hearts and eyes, like civil war,
1755	Be blind with tears, and break o'ercharged with grief.
1756	
1757	[Enter a Father that has killed his son, bringing in the body]
1758	
1759	Father	Thou that so stoutly hast resisted me,
1760	Give me thy gold, if thou hast any gold:
1761	For I have bought it with an hundred blows.
1762	But let me see: is this our foeman's face?
1763	Ah, no, no, no, it is mine only son!
1764	Ah, boy, if any life be left in thee,
1765	Throw up thine eye! see, see what showers arise,
1766	Blown with the windy tempest of my heart,
1767	Upon thy words, that kill mine eye and heart!
1768	O, pity, God, this miserable age!
1769	What stratagems, how fell, how butcherly,
1770	Erroneous, mutinous and unnatural,
1771	This deadly quarrel daily doth beget!
1772	O boy, thy father gave thee life too soon,
1773	And hath bereft thee of thy life too late!
1774	
1775	KING HENRY VI	Woe above woe! grief more than common grief!
1776	O that my death would stay these ruthful deeds!
1777	O pity, pity, gentle heaven, pity!
1778	The red rose and the white are on his face,
1779	The fatal colours of our striving houses:
1780	The one his purple blood right well resembles;
1781	The other his pale cheeks, methinks, presenteth:
1782	Wither one rose, and let the other flourish;
1783	If you contend, a thousand lives must wither.
1784	
1785	Son	How will my mother for a father's death
1786	Take on with me and ne'er be satisfied!
1787	
1788	Father	How will my wife for slaughter of my son
1789	Shed seas of tears and ne'er be satisfied!
1790	
1791	KING HENRY VI	How will the country for these woful chances
1792	Misthink the king and not be satisfied!
1793	
1794	Son	Was ever son so rued a father's death?
1795	
1796	Father	Was ever father so bemoan'd his son?
1797	
1798	KING HENRY VI	Was ever king so grieved for subjects' woe?
1799	Much is your sorrow; mine ten times so much.
1800	
1801	Son	I'll bear thee hence, where I may weep my fill.
1802	
1803	[Exit with the body]
1804	
1805	Father	These arms of mine shall be thy winding-sheet;
1806	My heart, sweet boy, shall be thy sepulchre,
1807	For from my heart thine image ne'er shall go;
1808	My sighing breast shall be thy funeral bell;
1809	And so obsequious will thy father be,
1810	Even for the loss of thee, having no more,
1811	As Priam was for all his valiant sons.
1812	I'll bear thee hence; and let them fight that will,
1813	For I have murdered where I should not kill.
1814

1821	EDWARD, and EXETER]

1823	PRINCE EDWARD	Fly, father, fly! for all your friends are fled,
1824	And Warwick rages like a chafed bull:
1825	Away! for death doth hold us in pursuit.
1826	
1827	QUEEN MARGARET	Mount you, my lord; towards Berwick post amain:
1828	Edward and Richard, like a brace of greyhounds
1829	Having the fearful flying hare in sight,
1830	With fiery eyes sparkling for very wrath,
1831	And bloody steel grasp'd in their ireful hands,
1832	Are at our backs; and therefore hence amain.
1833	
1834	EXETER	Away! for vengeance comes along with them:
1835	Nay, stay not to expostulate, make speed;
1836	Or else come after: I'll away before.
1837	
1838	KING HENRY VI	Nay, take me with thee, good sweet Exeter:
1839	Not that I fear to stay, but love to go
1840	Whither the queen intends. Forward; away!

1857	[A loud alarum. Enter CLIFFORD, wounded]
1858	
1859	CLIFFORD	Here burns my candle out; ay, here it dies,
1860	Which, whiles it lasted, gave King Henry light.
1861	O Lancaster, I fear thy overthrow
1862	More than my body's parting with my soul!
1863	My love and fear glued many friends to thee;
1864	And, now I fall, thy tough commixture melts.
1865	Impairing Henry, strengthening misproud York,
1866	The common people swarm like summer flies;
1867	And whither fly the gnats but to the sun?
1868	And who shines now but Henry's enemies?
1869	O Phoebus, hadst thou never given consent
1870	That Phaethon should cheque thy fiery steeds,
1871	Thy burning car never had scorch'd the earth!
1872	And, Henry, hadst thou sway'd as kings should do,
1873	Or as thy father and his father did,
1874	Giving no ground unto the house of York,
1875	They never then had sprung like summer flies;
1876	I and ten thousand in this luckless realm
1877	Had left no mourning widows for our death;
1878	And thou this day hadst kept thy chair in peace.
1879	For what doth cherish weeds but gentle air?
1880	And what makes robbers bold but too much lenity?
1881	Bootless are plaints, and cureless are my wounds;
1882	No way to fly, nor strength to hold out flight:
1883	The foe is merciless, and will not pity;
1884	For at their hands I have deserved no pity.
1885	The air hath got into my deadly wounds,
1886	And much effuse of blood doth make me faint.
1887	Come, York and Richard, Warwick and the rest;
1888	I stabb'd your fathers' bosoms, split my breast.
1889	
1890	[He faints]
1891	
1892	[Alarum and retreat. Enter EDWARD, GEORGE, RICHARD,
1893	MONTAGUE, WARWICK, and Soldiers]
1894	
1895	EDWARD	Now breathe we, lords: good fortune bids us pause,
1896	And smooth the frowns of war with peaceful looks.
1897	Some troops pursue the bloody-minded queen,
1898	That led calm Henry, though he were a king,
1899	As doth a sail, fill'd with a fretting gust,
1900	Command an argosy to stem the waves.
1901	But think you, lords, that Clifford fled with them?
1902	
1903	WARWICK	No, 'tis impossible he should escape,
1904	For, though before his face I speak the words
1905	Your brother Richard mark'd him for the grave:
1906	And wheresoe'er he is, he's surely dead.
1907	
1908	[CLIFFORD groans, and dies]
1909	
1910	EDWARD	Whose soul is that which takes her heavy leave?
1911	
1912	RICHARD	A deadly groan, like life and death's departing.
1913	
1914	EDWARD	See who it is: and, now the battle's ended,
1915	If friend or foe, let him be gently used.
1916	
1917	RICHARD	Revoke that doom of mercy, for 'tis Clifford;
1918	Who not contented that he lopp'd the branch
1919	In hewing Rutland when his leaves put forth,
1920	But set his murdering knife unto the root
1921	From whence that tender spray did sweetly spring,
1922	I mean our princely father, Duke of York.
1923	
1924	WARWICK	From off the gates of York fetch down the head,
1925	Your father's head, which Clifford placed there;
1926	Instead whereof let this supply the room:
1927	Measure for measure must be answered.
1928	
1929	EDWARD	Bring forth that fatal screech-owl to our house,
1930	That nothing sung but death to us and ours:
1931	Now death shall stop his dismal threatening sound,
1932	And his ill-boding tongue no more shall speak.
1933	
1934	WARWICK	I think his understanding is bereft.
1935	Speak, Clifford, dost thou know who speaks to thee?
1936	Dark cloudy death o'ershades his beams of life,
1937	And he nor sees nor hears us what we say.
1938	
1939	RICHARD	O, would he did! and so perhaps he doth:
1940	'Tis but his policy to counterfeit,
1941	Because he would avoid such bitter taunts
1942	Which in the time of death he gave our father.
1943	
1944	GEORGE	If so thou think'st, vex him with eager words.
1945	
1946	RICHARD	Clifford, ask mercy and obtain no grace.
1947	
1948	EDWARD	Clifford, repent in bootless penitence.
1949	
1950	WARWICK	Clifford, devise excuses for thy faults.
1951	
1952	GEORGE	While we devise fell tortures for thy faults.
1953	
1954	RICHARD	Thou didst love York, and I am son to York.
1955	
1956	EDWARD	Thou pitied'st Rutland; I will pity thee.
1957	
1958	GEORGE	Where's Captain Margaret, to fence you now?
1959	
1960	WARWICK	They mock thee, Clifford: swear as thou wast wont.
1961	
1962	RICHARD	What, not an oath? nay, then the world goes hard
1963	When Clifford cannot spare his friends an oath.
1964	I know by that he's dead; and, by my soul,
1965	If this right hand would buy two hour's life,
1966	That I in all despite might rail at him,
1967	This hand should chop it off, and with the
1968	issuing blood
1969	Stifle the villain whose unstanched thirst
1970	York and young Rutland could not satisfy.
1971	
1972	WARWICK	Ay, but he's dead: off with the traitor's head,
1973	And rear it in the place your father's stands.
1974	And now to London with triumphant march,
1975	There to be crowned England's royal king:
1976	From whence shall Warwick cut the sea to France,
1977	And ask the Lady Bona for thy queen:
1978	So shalt thou sinew both these lands together;
1979	And, having France thy friend, thou shalt not dread
1980	The scatter'd foe that hopes to rise again;
1981	For though they cannot greatly sting to hurt,
1982	Yet look to have them buzz to offend thine ears.
1983	First will I see the coronation;
1984	And then to Brittany I'll cross the sea,
1985	To effect this marriage, so it please my lord.
1986	
1987	EDWARD	Even as thou wilt, sweet Warwick, let it be;
1988	For in thy shoulder do I build my seat,
1989	And never will I undertake the thing
1990	Wherein thy counsel and consent is wanting.
1991	Richard, I will create thee Duke of Gloucester,
1992	And George, of Clarence: Warwick, as ourself,
1993	Shall do and undo as him pleaseth best.
1994	
1995	RICHARD	Let me be Duke of Clarence, George of Gloucester;
1996	For Gloucester's dukedom is too ominous.
1997	
1998	WARWICK	Tut, that's a foolish observation:
1999	Richard, be Duke of Gloucester. Now to London,

2015	
2016	
2017	[Enter two Keepers, with cross-bows in their hands]
2018	
2019	First Keeper	Under this thick-grown brake we'll shroud ourselves;
2020	For through this laund anon the deer will come;
2021	And in this covert will we make our stand,
2022	Culling the principal of all the deer.
2023	
2024	Second Keeper	I'll stay above the hill, so both may shoot.
2025	
2026	First Keeper	That cannot be; the noise of thy cross-bow
2027	Will scare the herd, and so my shoot is lost.
2028	Here stand we both, and aim we at the best:
2029	And, for the time shall not seem tedious,
2030	I'll tell thee what befell me on a day
2031	In this self-place where now we mean to stand.
2032	
2033	Second Keeper	Here comes a man; let's stay till he be past.
2034	
2035	[Enter KING HENRY VI, disguised, with a prayerbook]
2036	
2037	KING HENRY VI	From Scotland am I stol'n, even of pure love,
2038	To greet mine own land with my wishful sight.
2039	No, Harry, Harry, 'tis no land of thine;
2040	Thy place is fill'd, thy sceptre wrung from thee,
2041	Thy balm wash'd off wherewith thou wast anointed:
2042	No bending knee will call thee Caesar now,
2043	No humble suitors press to speak for right,
2044	No, not a man comes for redress of thee;
2045	For how can I help them, and not myself?
2046	
2047	First Keeper	Ay, here's a deer whose skin's a keeper's fee:
2048	This is the quondam king; let's seize upon him.
2049	
2050	KING HENRY VI	Let me embrace thee, sour adversity,
2051	For wise men say it is the wisest course.
2052	
2053	Second Keeper	Why linger we? let us lay hands upon him.
2054	
2055	First Keeper	Forbear awhile; we'll hear a little more.
2056	
2057	KING HENRY VI	My queen and son are gone to France for aid;
2058	And, as I hear, the great commanding Warwick
2059	Is thither gone, to crave the French king's sister
2060	To wife for Edward: if this news be true,
2061	Poor queen and son, your labour is but lost;
2062	For Warwick is a subtle orator,
2063	And Lewis a prince soon won with moving words.
2064	By this account then Margaret may win him;
2065	For she's a woman to be pitied much:
2066	Her sighs will make a battery in his breast;
2067	Her tears will pierce into a marble heart;
2068	The tiger will be mild whiles she doth mourn;
2069	And Nero will be tainted with remorse,
2070	To hear and see her plaints, her brinish tears.
2071	Ay, but she's come to beg, Warwick to give;
2072	She, on his left side, craving aid for Henry,
2073	He, on his right, asking a wife for Edward.
2074	She weeps, and says her Henry is deposed;
2075	He smiles, and says his Edward is install'd;
2076	That she, poor wretch, for grief can speak no more;
2077	Whiles Warwick tells his title, smooths the wrong,
2078	Inferreth arguments of mighty strength,
2079	And in conclusion wins the king from her,
2080	With promise of his sister, and what else,
2081	To strengthen and support King Edward's place.
2082	O Margaret, thus 'twill be; and thou, poor soul,
2083	Art then forsaken, as thou went'st forlorn!
2084	
2085	Second Keeper	Say, what art thou that talk'st of kings and queens?
2086	
2087	KING HENRY VI	More than I seem, and less than I was born to:
2088	A man at least, for less I should not be;
2089	And men may talk of kings, and why not I?
2090	
2091	Second Keeper	Ay, but thou talk'st as if thou wert a king.
2092	
2093	KING HENRY VI	Why, so I am, in mind; and that's enough.
2094	
2095	Second Keeper	But, if thou be a king, where is thy crown?
2096	
2097	KING HENRY VI	My crown is in my heart, not on my head;
2098	Not decked with diamonds and Indian stones,
2099	Nor to be seen: my crown is called content:
2100	A crown it is that seldom kings enjoy.
2101	
2102	Second Keeper	Well, if you be a king crown'd with content,
2103	Your crown content and you must be contented
2104	To go along with us; for as we think,
2105	You are the king King Edward hath deposed;
2106	And we his subjects sworn in all allegiance
2107	Will apprehend you as his enemy.
2108	
2109	KING HENRY VI	But did you never swear, and break an oath?
2110	
2111	Second Keeper	No, never such an oath; nor will not now.
2112	
2113	KING HENRY VI	Where did you dwell when I was King of England?
2114	
2115	Second Keeper	Here in this country, where we now remain.
2116	
2117	KING HENRY VI	I was anointed king at nine months old;
2118	My father and my grandfather were kings,
2119	And you were sworn true subjects unto me:
2120	And tell me, then, have you not broke your oaths?
2121	
2122	First Keeper	No;
2123	For we were subjects but while you were king.
2124	
2125	KING HENRY VI	Why, am I dead? do I not breathe a man?
2126	Ah, simple men, you know not what you swear!
2127	Look, as I blow this feather from my face,
2128	And as the air blows it to me again,
2129	Obeying with my wind when I do blow,
2130	And yielding to another when it blows,
2131	Commanded always by the greater gust;
2132	Such is the lightness of you common men.
2133	But do not break your oaths; for of that sin
2134	My mild entreaty shall not make you guilty.
2135	Go where you will, the king shall be commanded;
2136	And be you kings, command, and I'll obey.
2137	
2138	First Keeper	We are true subjects to the king, King Edward.
2139	
2140	KING HENRY VI	So would you be again to Henry,
2141	If he were seated as King Edward is.
2142	
2143	First Keeper	We charge you, in God's name, and the king's,
2144	To go with us unto the officers.
2145	
2146	KING HENRY VI	In God's name, lead; your king's name be obey'd:
2147	And what God will, that let your king perform;
2148	And what he will, I humbly yield unto.
2149

2158	ACT III
2159	
2160	
2161	
2162	SCENE II	London. The palace.
2163	
2164	
2165	[Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and
2166	LADY GREY]
2167	
2168	KING EDWARD IV	Brother of Gloucester, at Saint Alban's field
2169	This lady's husband, Sir Richard Grey, was slain,
2170	His lands then seized on by the conqueror:
2171	Her suit is now to repossess those lands;
2172	Which we in justice cannot well deny,
2173	Because in quarrel of the house of York
2174	The worthy gentleman did lose his life.
2175	
2176	GLOUCESTER	Your highness shall do well to grant her suit;
2177	It were dishonour to deny it her.
2178	
2179	KING EDWARD IV	It were no less; but yet I'll make a pause.
2180	
2181	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Yea, is it so?
2182	I see the lady hath a thing to grant,
2183	Before the king will grant her humble suit.
2184	
2185	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He knows the game: how true
2186	he keeps the wind!
2187	
2188	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Silence!
2189	
2190	KING EDWARD IV	Widow, we will consider of your suit;
2191	And come some other time to know our mind.
2192	
2193	LADY GREY	Right gracious lord, I cannot brook delay:
2194	May it please your highness to resolve me now;
2195	And what your pleasure is, shall satisfy me.
2196	
2197	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, widow? then I'll warrant
2198	you all your lands,
2199	An if what pleases him shall pleasure you.
2200	Fight closer, or, good faith, you'll catch a blow.
2201	
2202	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I fear her not, unless she
2203	chance to fall.
2204	
2205	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE] God forbid that! for he'll
2206	take vantages.
2207	
2208	KING EDWARD IV	How many children hast thou, widow? tell me.
2209	
2210	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  I think he means to beg a
2211	child of her.
2212	
2213	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Nay, whip me then: he'll rather
2214	give her two.
2215	
2216	LADY GREY	Three, my most gracious lord.
2217	
2218	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  You shall have four, if you'll
2219	be ruled by him.
2220	
2221	KING EDWARD IV	'Twere pity they should lose their father's lands.
2222	
2223	LADY GREY	Be pitiful, dread lord, and grant it then.
2224	
2225	KING EDWARD IV	Lords, give us leave: I'll try this widow's wit.
2226	
2227	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  Ay, good leave have you; for
2228	you will have leave,
2229	Till youth take leave and leave you to the crutch.
2230	
2231	[GLOUCESTER and CLARENCE retire]
2232	
2233	KING EDWARD IV	Now tell me, madam, do you love your children?
2234	
2235	LADY GREY	Ay, full as dearly as I love myself.
2236	
2237	KING EDWARD IV	And would you not do much to do them good?
2238	
2239	LADY GREY	To do them good, I would sustain some harm.
2240	
2241	KING EDWARD IV	Then get your husband's lands, to do them good.
2242	
2243	LADY GREY	Therefore I came unto your majesty.
2244	
2245	KING EDWARD IV	I'll tell you how these lands are to be got.
2246	
2247	LADY GREY	So shall you bind me to your highness' service.
2248	
2249	KING EDWARD IV	What service wilt thou do me, if I give them?
2250	
2251	LADY GREY	What you command, that rests in me to do.
2252	
2253	KING EDWARD IV	But you will take exceptions to my boon.
2254	
2255	LADY GREY	No, gracious lord, except I cannot do it.
2256	
2257	KING EDWARD IV	Ay, but thou canst do what I mean to ask.
2258	
2259	LADY GREY	Why, then I will do what your grace commands.
2260	
2261	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  He plies her hard; and much rain
2262	wears the marble.
2263	
2264	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  As red as fire! nay, then
2265	her wax must melt.
2266	
2267	LADY GREY	Why stops my lord, shall I not hear my task?
2268	
2269	KING EDWARD IV	An easy task; 'tis but to love a king.
2270	
2271	LADY GREY	That's soon perform'd, because I am a subject.
2272	
2273	KING EDWARD IV	Why, then, thy husband's lands I freely give thee.
2274	
2275	LADY GREY	I take my leave with many thousand thanks.
2276	
2277	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  The match is made; she seals it
2278	with a curtsy.
2279	
2280	KING EDWARD IV	But stay thee, 'tis the fruits of love I mean.
2281	
2282	LADY GREY	The fruits of love I mean, my loving liege.
2283	
2284	KING EDWARD IV	Ay, but, I fear me, in another sense.
2285	What love, think'st thou, I sue so much to get?
2286	
2287	LADY GREY	My love till death, my humble thanks, my prayers;
2288	That love which virtue begs and virtue grants.
2289	
2290	KING EDWARD IV	No, by my troth, I did not mean such love.
2291	
2292	LADY GREY	Why, then you mean not as I thought you did.
2293	
2294	KING EDWARD IV	But now you partly may perceive my mind.
2295	
2296	LADY GREY	My mind will never grant what I perceive
2297	Your highness aims at, if I aim aright.
2298	
2299	KING EDWARD IV	To tell thee plain, I aim to lie with thee.
2300	
2301	LADY GREY	To tell you plain, I had rather lie in prison.
2302	
2303	KING EDWARD IV	Why, then thou shalt not have thy husband's lands.
2304	
2305	LADY GREY	Why, then mine honesty shall be my dower;
2306	For by that loss I will not purchase them.
2307	
2308	KING EDWARD IV	Therein thou wrong'st thy children mightily.
2309	
2310	LADY GREY	Herein your highness wrongs both them and me.
2311	But, mighty lord, this merry inclination
2312	Accords not with the sadness of my suit:
2313	Please you dismiss me either with 'ay' or 'no.'
2314	
2315	KING EDWARD IV	Ay, if thou wilt say 'ay' to my request;
2316	No if thou dost say 'no' to my demand.
2317	
2318	LADY GREY	Then, no, my lord. My suit is at an end.
2319	
2320	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  The widow likes him not, she
2321	knits her brows.
2322	
2323	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  He is the bluntest wooer in
2324	Christendom.
2325	
2326	KING EDWARD IV	[Aside]  Her looks do argue her replete with modesty;
2327	Her words do show her wit incomparable;
2328	All her perfections challenge sovereignty:
2329	One way or other, she is for a king;
2330	And she shall be my love, or else my queen.--
2331	Say that King Edward take thee for his queen?
2332	
2333	LADY GREY	'Tis better said than done, my gracious lord:
2334	I am a subject fit to jest withal,
2335	But far unfit to be a sovereign.
2336	
2337	KING EDWARD IV	Sweet widow, by my state I swear to thee
2338	I speak no more than what my soul intends;
2339	And that is, to enjoy thee for my love.
2340	
2341	LADY GREY	And that is more than I will yield unto:
2342	I know I am too mean to be your queen,
2343	And yet too good to be your concubine.
2344	
2345	KING EDWARD IV	You cavil, widow: I did mean, my queen.
2346	
2347	LADY GREY	'Twill grieve your grace my sons should call you father.
2348	
2349	KING EDWARD IV	No more than when my daughters call thee mother.
2350	Thou art a widow, and thou hast some children;
2351	And, by God's mother, I, being but a bachelor,
2352	Have other some: why, 'tis a happy thing
2353	To be the father unto many sons.
2354	Answer no more, for thou shalt be my queen.
2355	
2356	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CLARENCE]  The ghostly father now hath done
2357	his shrift.
2358	
2359	CLARENCE	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  When he was made a shriver,
2360	'twas for shift.
2361	
2362	KING EDWARD IV	Brothers, you muse what chat we two have had.
2363	
2364	GLOUCESTER	The widow likes it not, for she looks very sad.
2365	
2366	KING EDWARD IV	You'll think it strange if I should marry her.
2367	
2368	CLARENCE	To whom, my lord?
2369	
2370	KING EDWARD IV	                  Why, Clarence, to myself.
2371	
2372	GLOUCESTER	That would be ten days' wonder at the least.
2373	
2374	CLARENCE	That's a day longer than a wonder lasts.
2375	
2376	GLOUCESTER	By so much is the wonder in extremes.
2377	
2378	KING EDWARD IV	Well, jest on, brothers: I can tell you both
2379	Her suit is granted for her husband's lands.
2380	
2381	[Enter a Nobleman]
2382	
2383	Nobleman	My gracious lord, Henry your foe is taken,
2384	And brought your prisoner to your palace gate.
2385	
2386	KING EDWARD IV	See that he be convey'd unto the Tower:
2387	And go we, brothers, to the man that took him,
2388	To question of his apprehension.
2389	Widow, go you along. Lords, use her honourably.
2390	
2391	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
2392	
2393	GLOUCESTER	Ay, Edward will use women honourably.
2394	Would he were wasted, marrow, bones and all,
2395	That from his loins no hopeful branch may spring,
2396	To cross me from the golden time I look for!
2397	And yet, between my soul's desire and me--
2398	The lustful Edward's title buried--
2399	Is Clarence, Henry, and his son young Edward,
2400	And all the unlook'd for issue of their bodies,
2401	To take their rooms, ere I can place myself:
2402	A cold premeditation for my purpose!
2403	Why, then, I do but dream on sovereignty;
2404	Like one that stands upon a promontory,
2405	And spies a far-off shore where he would tread,
2406	Wishing his foot were equal with his eye,
2407	And chides the sea that sunders him from thence,
2408	Saying, he'll lade it dry to have his way:
2409	So do I wish the crown, being so far off;
2410	And so I chide the means that keeps me from it;
2411	And so I say, I'll cut the causes off,
2412	Flattering me with impossibilities.
2413	My eye's too quick, my heart o'erweens too much,
2414	Unless my hand and strength could equal them.
2415	Well, say there is no kingdom then for Richard;
2416	What other pleasure can the world afford?
2417	I'll make my heaven in a lady's lap,
2418	And deck my body in gay ornaments,
2419	And witch sweet ladies with my words and looks.
2420	O miserable thought! and more unlikely
2421	Than to accomplish twenty golden crowns!
2422	Why, love forswore me in my mother's womb:
2423	And, for I should not deal in her soft laws,
2424	She did corrupt frail nature with some bribe,
2425	To shrink mine arm up like a wither'd shrub;
2426	To make an envious mountain on my back,
2427	Where sits deformity to mock my body;
2428	To shape my legs of an unequal size;
2429	To disproportion me in every part,
2430	Like to a chaos, or an unlick'd bear-whelp
2431	That carries no impression like the dam.
2432	And am I then a man to be beloved?
2433	O monstrous fault, to harbour such a thought!
2434	Then, since this earth affords no joy to me,
2435	But to command, to cheque, to o'erbear such
2436	As are of better person than myself,
2437	I'll make my heaven to dream upon the crown,
2438	And, whiles I live, to account this world but hell,
2439	Until my mis-shaped trunk that bears this head
2440	Be round impaled with a glorious crown.
2441	And yet I know not how to get the crown,
2442	For many lives stand between me and home:
2443	And I,--like one lost in a thorny wood,
2444	That rends the thorns and is rent with the thorns,
2445	Seeking a way and straying from the way;
2446	Not knowing how to find the open air,
2447	But toiling desperately to find it out,--
2448	Torment myself to catch the English crown:
2449	And from that torment I will free myself,
2450	Or hew my way out with a bloody axe.
2451	Why, I can smile, and murder whiles I smile,
2452	And cry 'Content' to that which grieves my heart,
2453	And wet my cheeks with artificial tears,
2454	And frame my face to all occasions.
2455	I'll drown more sailors than the mermaid shall;
2456	I'll slay more gazers than the basilisk;
2457	I'll play the orator as well as Nestor,
2458	Deceive more slily than Ulysses could,
2459	And, like a Sinon, take another Troy.
2460	I can add colours to the chameleon,
2461	Change shapes with Proteus for advantages,
2462	And set the murderous Machiavel to school.
2463	Can I do this, and cannot get a crown?
2464	Tut, were it farther off, I'll pluck it down.
2465

2473	
2474	ACT III
2475	
2476	
2477	
2478	SCENE III	France. KING LEWIS XI's palace.
2479	
2480	
2481	[Flourish. Enter KING LEWIS XI, his sister BONA,
2482	his Admiral, called BOURBON, PRINCE EDWARD, QUEEN
2483	MARGARET, and OXFORD. KING LEWIS XI sits, and
2484	riseth up again]
2485	
2486	KING LEWIS XI	Fair Queen of England, worthy Margaret,
2487	Sit down with us: it ill befits thy state
2488	And birth, that thou shouldst stand while Lewis doth sit.
2489	
2490	QUEEN MARGARET	No, mighty King of France: now Margaret
2491	Must strike her sail and learn awhile to serve
2492	Where kings command. I was, I must confess,
2493	Great Albion's queen in former golden days:
2494	But now mischance hath trod my title down,
2495	And with dishonour laid me on the ground;
2496	Where I must take like seat unto my fortune,
2497	And to my humble seat conform myself.
2498	
2499	KING LEWIS XI	Why, say, fair queen, whence springs this deep despair?
2500	
2501	QUEEN MARGARET	From such a cause as fills mine eyes with tears
2502	And stops my tongue, while heart is drown'd in cares.
2503	
2504	KING LEWIS XI	Whate'er it be, be thou still like thyself,
2505	And sit thee by our side:
2506	
2507	[Seats her by him]
2508	
2509	Yield not thy neck
2510	To fortune's yoke, but let thy dauntless mind
2511	Still ride in triumph over all mischance.
2512	Be plain, Queen Margaret, and tell thy grief;
2513	It shall be eased, if France can yield relief.
2514	
2515	QUEEN MARGARET	Those gracious words revive my drooping thoughts
2516	And give my tongue-tied sorrows leave to speak.
2517	Now, therefore, be it known to noble Lewis,
2518	That Henry, sole possessor of my love,
2519	Is of a king become a banish'd man,
2520	And forced to live in Scotland a forlorn;
2521	While proud ambitious Edward Duke of York
2522	Usurps the regal title and the seat
2523	Of England's true-anointed lawful king.
2524	This is the cause that I, poor Margaret,
2525	With this my son, Prince Edward, Henry's heir,
2526	Am come to crave thy just and lawful aid;
2527	And if thou fail us, all our hope is done:
2528	Scotland hath will to help, but cannot help;
2529	Our people and our peers are both misled,
2530	Our treasures seized, our soldiers put to flight,
2531	And, as thou seest, ourselves in heavy plight.
2532	
2533	KING LEWIS XI	Renowned queen, with patience calm the storm,
2534	While we bethink a means to break it off.
2535	
2536	QUEEN MARGARET	The more we stay, the stronger grows our foe.
2537	
2538	KING LEWIS XI	The more I stay, the more I'll succor thee.
2539	
2540	QUEEN MARGARET	O, but impatience waiteth on true sorrow.
2541	And see where comes the breeder of my sorrow!
2542	
2543	[Enter WARWICK]
2544	
2545	KING LEWIS XI	What's he approacheth boldly to our presence?
2546	
2547	QUEEN MARGARET	Our Earl of Warwick, Edward's greatest friend.
2548	
2549	KING LEWIS XI	Welcome, brave Warwick! What brings thee to France?
2550	
2551	[He descends. She ariseth]
2552	
2553	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, now begins a second storm to rise;
2554	For this is he that moves both wind and tide.
2555	
2556	WARWICK	From worthy Edward, King of Albion,
2557	My lord and sovereign, and thy vowed friend,
2558	I come, in kindness and unfeigned love,
2559	First, to do greetings to thy royal person;
2560	And then to crave a league of amity;
2561	And lastly, to confirm that amity
2562	With a nuptial knot, if thou vouchsafe to grant
2563	That virtuous Lady Bona, thy fair sister,
2564	To England's king in lawful marriage.
2565	
2566	QUEEN MARGARET	[Aside]  If that go forward, Henry's hope is done.
2567	
2568	WARWICK	[To BONA]  And, gracious madam, in our king's behalf,
2569	I am commanded, with your leave and favour,
2570	Humbly to kiss your hand, and with my tongue
2571	To tell the passion of my sovereign's heart;
2572	Where fame, late entering at his heedful ears,
2573	Hath placed thy beauty's image and thy virtue.
2574	
2575	QUEEN MARGARET	King Lewis and Lady Bona, hear me speak,
2576	Before you answer Warwick. His demand
2577	Springs not from Edward's well-meant honest love,
2578	But from deceit bred by necessity;
2579	For how can tyrants safely govern home,
2580	Unless abroad they purchase great alliance?
2581	To prove him tyrant this reason may suffice,
2582	That Henry liveth still: but were he dead,
2583	Yet here Prince Edward stands, King Henry's son.
2584	Look, therefore, Lewis, that by this league and marriage
2585	Thou draw not on thy danger and dishonour;
2586	For though usurpers sway the rule awhile,
2587	Yet heavens are just, and time suppresseth wrongs.
2588	
2589	WARWICK	Injurious Margaret!
2590	
2591	PRINCE EDWARD	And why not queen?
2592	
2593	WARWICK	Because thy father Henry did usurp;
2594	And thou no more are prince than she is queen.
2595	
2596	OXFORD	Then Warwick disannuls great John of Gaunt,
2597	Which did subdue the greatest part of Spain;
2598	And, after John of Gaunt, Henry the Fourth,
2599	Whose wisdom was a mirror to the wisest;
2600	And, after that wise prince, Henry the Fifth,
2601	Who by his prowess conquered all France:
2602	From these our Henry lineally descends.
2603	
2604	WARWICK	Oxford, how haps it, in this smooth discourse,
2605	You told not how Henry the Sixth hath lost
2606	All that which Henry Fifth had gotten?
2607	Methinks these peers of France should smile at that.
2608	But for the rest, you tell a pedigree
2609	Of threescore and two years; a silly time
2610	To make prescription for a kingdom's worth.
2611	
2612	OXFORD	Why, Warwick, canst thou speak against thy liege,
2613	Whom thou obeyed'st thirty and six years,
2614	And not bewray thy treason with a blush?
2615	
2616	WARWICK	Can Oxford, that did ever fence the right,
2617	Now buckler falsehood with a pedigree?
2618	For shame! leave Henry, and call Edward king.
2619	
2620	OXFORD	Call him my king by whose injurious doom
2621	My elder brother, the Lord Aubrey Vere,
2622	Was done to death? and more than so, my father,
2623	Even in the downfall of his mellow'd years,
2624	When nature brought him to the door of death?
2625	No, Warwick, no; while life upholds this arm,
2626	This arm upholds the house of Lancaster.
2627	
2628	WARWICK	And I the house of York.
2629	
2630	KING LEWIS XI	Queen Margaret, Prince Edward, and Oxford,
2631	Vouchsafe, at our request, to stand aside,
2632	While I use further conference with Warwick.
2633	
2634	[They stand aloof]
2635	
2636	QUEEN MARGARET	Heavens grant that Warwick's words bewitch him not!
2637	
2638	KING LEWIS XI	Now Warwick, tell me, even upon thy conscience,
2639	Is Edward your true king? for I were loath
2640	To link with him that were not lawful chosen.
2641	
2642	WARWICK	Thereon I pawn my credit and mine honour.
2643	
2644	KING LEWIS XI	But is he gracious in the people's eye?
2645	
2646	WARWICK	The more that Henry was unfortunate.
2647	
2648	KING LEWIS XI	Then further, all dissembling set aside,
2649	Tell me for truth the measure of his love
2650	Unto our sister Bona.
2651	
2652	WARWICK	Such it seems
2653	As may beseem a monarch like himself.
2654	Myself have often heard him say and swear
2655	That this his love was an eternal plant,
2656	Whereof the root was fix'd in virtue's ground,
2657	The leaves and fruit maintain'd with beauty's sun,
2658	Exempt from envy, but not from disdain,
2659	Unless the Lady Bona quit his pain.
2660	
2661	KING LEWIS XI	Now, sister, let us hear your firm resolve.
2662	
2663	BONA	Your grant, or your denial, shall be mine:
2664	
2665	[To WARWICK]
2666	
2667	Yet I confess that often ere this day,
2668	When I have heard your king's desert recounted,
2669	Mine ear hath tempted judgment to desire.
2670	
2671	KING LEWIS XI	Then, Warwick, thus: our sister shall be Edward's;
2672	And now forthwith shall articles be drawn
2673	Touching the jointure that your king must make,
2674	Which with her dowry shall be counterpoised.
2675	Draw near, Queen Margaret, and be a witness
2676	That Bona shall be wife to the English king.
2677	
2678	PRINCE EDWARD	To Edward, but not to the English king.
2679	
2680	QUEEN MARGARET	Deceitful Warwick! it was thy device
2681	By this alliance to make void my suit:
2682	Before thy coming Lewis was Henry's friend.
2683	
2684	KING LEWIS XI	And still is friend to him and Margaret:
2685	But if your title to the crown be weak,
2686	As may appear by Edward's good success,
2687	Then 'tis but reason that I be released
2688	From giving aid which late I promised.
2689	Yet shall you have all kindness at my hand
2690	That your estate requires and mine can yield.
2691	
2692	WARWICK	Henry now lives in Scotland at his ease,
2693	Where having nothing, nothing can he lose.
2694	And as for you yourself, our quondam queen,
2695	You have a father able to maintain you;
2696	And better 'twere you troubled him than France.
2697	
2698	QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, impudent and shameless Warwick, peace,
2699	Proud setter up and puller down of kings!
2700	I will not hence, till, with my talk and tears,
2701	Both full of truth, I make King Lewis behold
2702	Thy sly conveyance and thy lord's false love;
2703	For both of you are birds of selfsame feather.
2704	
2705	[Post blows a horn within]
2706	
2707	KING LEWIS XI	Warwick, this is some post to us or thee.
2708	
2709	[Enter a Post]
2710	
2711	Post	[To WARWICK]  My lord ambassador, these letters are for you,
2712	Sent from your brother, Marquess Montague:
2713	
2714	[To KING LEWIS XI]
2715	
2716	These from our king unto your majesty:
2717	
2718	[To QUEEN MARGARET]
2719	
2720	And, madam, these for you; from whom I know not.
2721	
2722	[They all read their letters]
2723	
2724	OXFORD	I like it well that our fair queen and mistress
2725	Smiles at her news, while Warwick frowns at his.
2726	
2727	PRINCE EDWARD	Nay, mark how Lewis stamps, as he were nettled:
2728	I hope all's for the best.
2729	
2730	KING LEWIS XI	Warwick, what are thy news? and yours, fair queen?
2731	
2732	QUEEN MARGARET	Mine, such as fill my heart with unhoped joys.
2733	
2734	WARWICK	Mine, full of sorrow and heart's discontent.
2735	
2736	KING LEWIS XI	What! has your king married the Lady Grey!
2737	And now, to soothe your forgery and his,
2738	Sends me a paper to persuade me patience?
2739	Is this the alliance that he seeks with France?
2740	Dare he presume to scorn us in this manner?
2741	
2742	QUEEN MARGARET	I told your majesty as much before:
2743	This proveth Edward's love and Warwick's honesty.
2744	
2745	WARWICK	King Lewis, I here protest, in sight of heaven,
2746	And by the hope I have of heavenly bliss,
2747	That I am clear from this misdeed of Edward's,
2748	No more my king, for he dishonours me,
2749	But most himself, if he could see his shame.
2750	Did I forget that by the house of York
2751	My father came untimely to his death?
2752	Did I let pass the abuse done to my niece?
2753	Did I impale him with the regal crown?
2754	Did I put Henry from his native right?
2755	And am I guerdon'd at the last with shame?
2756	Shame on himself! for my desert is honour:
2757	And to repair my honour lost for him,
2758	I here renounce him and return to Henry.
2759	My noble queen, let former grudges pass,
2760	And henceforth I am thy true servitor:
2761	I will revenge his wrong to Lady Bona,
2762	And replant Henry in his former state.
2763	
2764	QUEEN MARGARET	Warwick, these words have turn'd my hate to love;
2765	And I forgive and quite forget old faults,
2766	And joy that thou becomest King Henry's friend.
2767	
2768	WARWICK	So much his friend, ay, his unfeigned friend,
2769	That, if King Lewis vouchsafe to furnish us
2770	With some few bands of chosen soldiers,
2771	I'll undertake to land them on our coast
2772	And force the tyrant from his seat by war.
2773	'Tis not his new-made bride shall succor him:
2774	And as for Clarence, as my letters tell me,
2775	He's very likely now to fall from him,
2776	For matching more for wanton lust than honour,
2777	Or than for strength and safety of our country.
2778	
2779	BONA	Dear brother, how shall Bona be revenged
2780	But by thy help to this distressed queen?
2781	
2782	QUEEN MARGARET	Renowned prince, how shall poor Henry live,
2783	Unless thou rescue him from foul despair?
2784	
2785	BONA	My quarrel and this English queen's are one.
2786	
2787	WARWICK	And mine, fair lady Bona, joins with yours.
2788	
2789	KING LEWIS XI	And mine with hers, and thine, and Margaret's.
2790	Therefore at last I firmly am resolved
2791	You shall have aid.
2792	
2793	QUEEN MARGARET	Let me give humble thanks for all at once.
2794	
2795	KING LEWIS XI	Then, England's messenger, return in post,
2796	And tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
2797	That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
2798	To revel it with him and his new bride:
2799	Thou seest what's past, go fear thy king withal.
2800	
2801	BONA	Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
2802	I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.
2803	
2804	QUEEN MARGARET	Tell him, my mourning weeds are laid aside,
2805	And I am ready to put armour on.
2806	
2807	WARWICK	Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
2808	And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.
2809	There's thy reward: be gone.
2810	
2811	[Exit Post]
2812	
2813	KING LEWIS XI	But, Warwick,
2814	Thou and Oxford, with five thousand men,
2815	Shall cross the seas, and bid false Edward battle;
2816	And, as occasion serves, this noble queen
2817	And prince shall follow with a fresh supply.
2818	Yet, ere thou go, but answer me one doubt,
2819	What pledge have we of thy firm loyalty?
2820	
2821	WARWICK	This shall assure my constant loyalty,
2822	That if our queen and this young prince agree,
2823	I'll join mine eldest daughter and my joy
2824	To him forthwith in holy wedlock bands.
2825	
2826	QUEEN MARGARET	Yes, I agree, and thank you for your motion.
2827	Son Edward, she is fair and virtuous,
2828	Therefore delay not, give thy hand to Warwick;
2829	And, with thy hand, thy faith irrevocable,
2830	That only Warwick's daughter shall be thine.
2831	
2832	PRINCE EDWARD	Yes, I accept her, for she well deserves it;
2833	And here, to pledge my vow, I give my hand.
2834	
2835	[He gives his hand to WARWICK]
2836	
2837	KING LEWIS XI	Why stay we now? These soldiers shall be levied,
2838	And thou, Lord Bourbon, our high admiral,
2839	Shalt waft them over with our royal fleet.
2840	I long till Edward fall by war's mischance,
2841	For mocking marriage with a dame of France.
2842	
2843	[Exeunt all but WARWICK]
2844	
2845	WARWICK	I came from Edward as ambassador,
2846	But I return his sworn and mortal foe:
2847	Matter of marriage was the charge he gave me,
2848	But dreadful war shall answer his demand.
2849	Had he none else to make a stale but me?
2850	Then none but I shall turn his jest to sorrow.
2851	I was the chief that raised him to the crown,
2852	And I'll be chief to bring him down again:
2853	Not that I pity Henry's misery,
2854	But seek revenge on Edward's mockery.

2862	
2863	
2864	ACT IV
2865	
2866	
2867	
2868	SCENE I	London. The palace.
2869	
2870	
2871	[Enter GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, SOMERSET, and MONTAGUE]
2872	
2873	GLOUCESTER	Now tell me, brother Clarence, what think you
2874	Of this new marriage with the Lady Grey?
2875	Hath not our brother made a worthy choice?
2876	
2877	CLARENCE	Alas, you know, 'tis far from hence to France;
2878	How could he stay till Warwick made return?
2879	
2880	SOMERSET	My lords, forbear this talk; here comes the king.
2881	
2882	GLOUCESTER	And his well-chosen bride.
2883	
2884	CLARENCE	I mind to tell him plainly what I think.
2885	
2886	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, attended; QUEEN
2887	ELIZABETH, PEMBROKE, STAFFORD, HASTINGS, and others]
2888	
2889	KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother of Clarence, how like you our choice,
2890	That you stand pensive, as half malcontent?
2891	
2892	CLARENCE	As well as Lewis of France, or the Earl of Warwick,
2893	Which are so weak of courage and in judgment
2894	That they'll take no offence at our abuse.
2895	
2896	KING EDWARD IV	Suppose they take offence without a cause,
2897	They are but Lewis and Warwick: I am Edward,
2898	Your king and Warwick's, and must have my will.
2899	
2900	GLOUCESTER	And shall have your will, because our king:
2901	Yet hasty marriage seldom proveth well.
2902	
2903	KING EDWARD IV	Yea, brother Richard, are you offended too?
2904	
2905	GLOUCESTER	Not I:
2906	No, God forbid that I should wish them sever'd
2907	Whom God hath join'd together; ay, and 'twere pity
2908	To sunder them that yoke so well together.
2909	
2910	KING EDWARD IV	Setting your scorns and your mislike aside,
2911	Tell me some reason why the Lady Grey
2912	Should not become my wife and England's queen.
2913	And you too, Somerset and Montague,
2914	Speak freely what you think.
2915	
2916	CLARENCE	Then this is mine opinion: that King Lewis
2917	Becomes your enemy, for mocking him
2918	About the marriage of the Lady Bona.
2919	
2920	GLOUCESTER	And Warwick, doing what you gave in charge,
2921	Is now dishonoured by this new marriage.
2922	
2923	KING EDWARD IV	What if both Lewis and Warwick be appeased
2924	By such invention as I can devise?
2925	
2926	MONTAGUE	Yet, to have join'd with France in such alliance
2927	Would more have strengthen'd this our commonwealth
2928	'Gainst foreign storms than any home-bred marriage.
2929	
2930	HASTINGS	Why, knows not Montague that of itself
2931	England is safe, if true within itself?
2932	
2933	MONTAGUE	But the safer when 'tis back'd with France.
2934	
2935	HASTINGS	'Tis better using France than trusting France:
2936	Let us be back'd with God and with the seas
2937	Which He hath given for fence impregnable,
2938	And with their helps only defend ourselves;
2939	In them and in ourselves our safety lies.
2940	
2941	CLARENCE	For this one speech Lord Hastings well deserves
2942	To have the heir of the Lord Hungerford.
2943	
2944	KING EDWARD IV	Ay, what of that? it was my will and grant;
2945	And for this once my will shall stand for law.
2946	
2947	GLOUCESTER	And yet methinks your grace hath not done well,
2948	To give the heir and daughter of Lord Scales
2949	Unto the brother of your loving bride;
2950	She better would have fitted me or Clarence:
2951	But in your bride you bury brotherhood.
2952	
2953	CLARENCE	Or else you would not have bestow'd the heir
2954	Of the Lord Bonville on your new wife's son,
2955	And leave your brothers to go speed elsewhere.
2956	
2957	KING EDWARD IV	Alas, poor Clarence! is it for a wife
2958	That thou art malcontent? I will provide thee.
2959	
2960	CLARENCE	In choosing for yourself, you show'd your judgment,
2961	Which being shallow, you give me leave
2962	To play the broker in mine own behalf;
2963	And to that end I shortly mind to leave you.
2964	
2965	KING EDWARD IV	Leave me, or tarry, Edward will be king,
2966	And not be tied unto his brother's will.
2967	
2968	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My lords, before it pleased his majesty
2969	To raise my state to title of a queen,
2970	Do me but right, and you must all confess
2971	That I was not ignoble of descent;
2972	And meaner than myself have had like fortune.
2973	But as this title honours me and mine,
2974	So your dislike, to whom I would be pleasing,
2975	Doth cloud my joys with danger and with sorrow.
2976	
2977	KING EDWARD IV	My love, forbear to fawn upon their frowns:
2978	What danger or what sorrow can befall thee,
2979	So long as Edward is thy constant friend,
2980	And their true sovereign, whom they must obey?
2981	Nay, whom they shall obey, and love thee too,
2982	Unless they seek for hatred at my hands;
2983	Which if they do, yet will I keep thee safe,
2984	And they shall feel the vengeance of my wrath.
2985	
2986	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  I hear, yet say not much, but think the more.
2987	
2988	[Enter a Post]
2989	
2990	KING EDWARD IV	Now, messenger, what letters or what news
2991	From France?
2992	
2993	Post	My sovereign liege, no letters; and few words,
2994	But such as I, without your special pardon,
2995	Dare not relate.
2996	
2997	KING EDWARD IV	Go to, we pardon thee: therefore, in brief,
2998	Tell me their words as near as thou canst guess them.
2999	What answer makes King Lewis unto our letters?
3000	
3001	Post	At my depart, these were his very words:
3002	'Go tell false Edward, thy supposed king,
3003	That Lewis of France is sending over masquers
3004	To revel it with him and his new bride.'
3005	
3006	KING EDWARD IV	Is Lewis so brave? belike he thinks me Henry.
3007	But what said Lady Bona to my marriage?
3008	
3009	Post	These were her words, utter'd with mad disdain:
3010	'Tell him, in hope he'll prove a widower shortly,
3011	I'll wear the willow garland for his sake.'
3012	
3013	KING EDWARD IV	I blame not her, she could say little less;
3014	She had the wrong. But what said Henry's queen?
3015	For I have heard that she was there in place.
3016	
3017	Post	'Tell him,' quoth she, 'my mourning weeds are done,
3018	And I am ready to put armour on.'
3019	
3020	KING EDWARD IV	Belike she minds to play the Amazon.
3021	But what said Warwick to these injuries?
3022	
3023	Post	He, more incensed against your majesty
3024	Than all the rest, discharged me with these words:
3025	'Tell him from me that he hath done me wrong,
3026	And therefore I'll uncrown him ere't be long.'
3027	
3028	KING EDWARD IV	Ha! durst the traitor breathe out so proud words?
3029	Well I will arm me, being thus forewarn'd:
3030	They shall have wars and pay for their presumption.
3031	But say, is Warwick friends with Margaret?
3032	
3033	Post	Ay, gracious sovereign; they are so link'd in
3034	friendship
3035	That young Prince Edward marries Warwick's daughter.
3036	
3037	CLARENCE	Belike the elder; Clarence will have the younger.
3038	Now, brother king, farewell, and sit you fast,
3039	For I will hence to Warwick's other daughter;
3040	That, though I want a kingdom, yet in marriage
3041	I may not prove inferior to yourself.
3042	You that love me and Warwick, follow me.
3043	
3044	[Exit CLARENCE, and SOMERSET follows]
3045	
3046	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Not I:
3047	My thoughts aim at a further matter; I
3048	Stay not for the love of Edward, but the crown.
3049	
3050	KING EDWARD IV	Clarence and Somerset both gone to Warwick!
3051	Yet am I arm'd against the worst can happen;
3052	And haste is needful in this desperate case.
3053	Pembroke and Stafford, you in our behalf
3054	Go levy men, and make prepare for war;
3055	They are already, or quickly will be landed:
3056	Myself in person will straight follow you.
3057	
3058	[Exeunt PEMBROKE and STAFFORD]
3059	
3060	But, ere I go, Hastings and Montague,
3061	Resolve my doubt. You twain, of all the rest,
3062	Are near to Warwick by blood and by alliance:
3063	Tell me if you love Warwick more than me?
3064	If it be so, then both depart to him;
3065	I rather wish you foes than hollow friends:
3066	But if you mind to hold your true obedience,
3067	Give me assurance with some friendly vow,
3068	That I may never have you in suspect.
3069	
3070	MONTAGUE	So God help Montague as he proves true!
3071	
3072	HASTINGS	And Hastings as he favours Edward's cause!
3073	
3074	KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother Richard, will you stand by us?
3075	
3076	GLOUCESTER	Ay, in despite of all that shall withstand you.
3077	
3078	KING EDWARD IV	Why, so! then am I sure of victory.
3079	Now therefore let us hence; and lose no hour,
3080	Till we meet Warwick with his foreign power.

3095	
3096	
3097	[Enter WARWICK and OXFORD, with French soldiers]
3098	
3099	WARWICK	Trust me, my lord, all hitherto goes well;
3100	The common people by numbers swarm to us.
3101	
3102	[Enter CLARENCE and SOMERSET]
3103	
3104	But see where Somerset and Clarence come!
3105	Speak suddenly, my lords, are we all friends?
3106	
3107	CLARENCE	Fear not that, my lord.
3108	
3109	WARWICK	Then, gentle Clarence, welcome unto Warwick;
3110	And welcome, Somerset: I hold it cowardice
3111	To rest mistrustful where a noble heart
3112	Hath pawn'd an open hand in sign of love;
3113	Else might I think that Clarence, Edward's brother,
3114	Were but a feigned friend to our proceedings:
3115	But welcome, sweet Clarence; my daughter shall be thine.
3116	And now what rests but, in night's coverture,
3117	Thy brother being carelessly encamp'd,
3118	His soldiers lurking in the towns about,
3119	And but attended by a simple guard,
3120	We may surprise and take him at our pleasure?
3121	Our scouts have found the adventure very easy:
3122	That as Ulysses and stout Diomede
3123	With sleight and manhood stole to Rhesus' tents,
3124	And brought from thence the Thracian fatal steeds,
3125	So we, well cover'd with the night's black mantle,
3126	At unawares may beat down Edward's guard
3127	And seize himself; I say not, slaughter him,
3128	For I intend but only to surprise him.
3129	You that will follow me to this attempt,
3130	Applaud the name of Henry with your leader.
3131	
3132	[They all cry, 'Henry!']
3133	
3134	Why, then, let's on our way in silent sort:

3149	SCENE III	Edward's camp, near Warwick.
3150	
3151	
3152	[Enter three Watchmen, to guard KING EDWARD IV's tent]
3153	
3154	First Watchman	Come on, my masters, each man take his stand:
3155	The king by this is set him down to sleep.
3156	
3157	Second Watchman	What, will he not to bed?
3158	
3159	First Watchman	Why, no; for he hath made a solemn vow
3160	Never to lie and take his natural rest
3161	Till Warwick or himself be quite suppress'd.
3162	
3163	Second Watchman	To-morrow then belike shall be the day,
3164	If Warwick be so near as men report.
3165	
3166	Third Watchman	But say, I pray, what nobleman is that
3167	That with the king here resteth in his tent?
3168	
3169	First Watchman	'Tis the Lord Hastings, the king's chiefest friend.
3170	
3171	Third Watchman	O, is it so? But why commands the king
3172	That his chief followers lodge in towns about him,
3173	While he himself keeps in the cold field?
3174	
3175	Second Watchman	'Tis the more honour, because more dangerous.
3176	
3177	Third Watchman	Ay, but give me worship and quietness;
3178	I like it better than a dangerous honour.
3179	If Warwick knew in what estate he stands,
3180	'Tis to be doubted he would waken him.
3181	
3182	First Watchman	Unless our halberds did shut up his passage.
3183	
3184	Second Watchman	Ay, wherefore else guard we his royal tent,
3185	But to defend his person from night-foes?
3186	
3187	[Enter WARWICK, CLARENCE, OXFORD, SOMERSET, and
3188	French soldiers, silent all]
3189	
3190	WARWICK	This is his tent; and see where stand his guard.
3191	Courage, my masters! honour now or never!
3192	But follow me, and Edward shall be ours.
3193	
3194	First Watchman	Who goes there?
3195	
3196	Second Watchman	Stay, or thou diest!
3197	
3198	[WARWICK and the rest cry all, 'Warwick! Warwick!'
3199	and set upon the Guard, who fly, crying, 'Arm!
3200	arm!' WARWICK and the rest following them]
3201	
3202	[The drum playing and trumpet sounding, reenter
3203	WARWICK, SOMERSET, and the rest, bringing KING
3204	EDWARD IV out in his gown, sitting in a chair.
3205	RICHARD and HASTINGS fly over the stage]
3206	
3207	SOMERSET	What are they that fly there?
3208	
3209	WARWICK	Richard and Hastings: let them go; here is The duke.
3210	
3211	KING EDWARD IV	        The duke! Why, Warwick, when we parted,
3212	Thou call'dst me king.
3213	
3214	WARWICK	Ay, but the case is alter'd:
3215	When you disgraced me in my embassade,
3216	Then I degraded you from being king,
3217	And come now to create you Duke of York.
3218	Alas! how should you govern any kingdom,
3219	That know not how to use ambassadors,
3220	Nor how to be contented with one wife,
3221	Nor how to use your brothers brotherly,
3222	Nor how to study for the people's welfare,
3223	Nor how to shroud yourself from enemies?
3224	
3225	KING EDWARD IV	Yea, brother of Clarence, are thou here too?
3226	Nay, then I see that Edward needs must down.
3227	Yet, Warwick, in despite of all mischance,
3228	Of thee thyself and all thy complices,
3229	Edward will always bear himself as king:
3230	Though fortune's malice overthrow my state,
3231	My mind exceeds the compass of her wheel.
3232	
3233	WARWICK	Then, for his mind, be Edward England's king:
3234	
3235	[Takes off his crown]
3236	
3237	But Henry now shall wear the English crown,
3238	And be true king indeed, thou but the shadow.
3239	My Lord of Somerset, at my request,
3240	See that forthwith Duke Edward be convey'd
3241	Unto my brother, Archbishop of York.
3242	When I have fought with Pembroke and his fellows,
3243	I'll follow you, and tell what answer
3244	Lewis and the Lady Bona send to him.
3245	Now, for a while farewell, good Duke of York.
3246	
3247	[They lead him out forcibly]
3248	
3249	KING EDWARD IV	What fates impose, that men must needs abide;
3250	It boots not to resist both wind and tide.
3251	
3252	[Exit, guarded]
3253	
3254	OXFORD	What now remains, my lords, for us to do
3255	But march to London with our soldiers?
3256	
3257	WARWICK	Ay, that's the first thing that we have to do;
3258	To free King Henry from imprisonment
3259	And see him seated in the regal throne.

3276	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and RIVERS]
3277	
3278	RIVERS	Madam, what makes you in this sudden change?
3279	
3280	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Why brother Rivers, are you yet to learn
3281	What late misfortune is befall'n King Edward?
3282	
3283	RIVERS	What! loss of some pitch'd battle against Warwick?
3284	
3285	QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, but the loss of his own royal person.
3286	
3287	RIVERS	Then is my sovereign slain?
3288	
3289	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ay, almost slain, for he is taken prisoner,
3290	Either betray'd by falsehood of his guard
3291	Or by his foe surprised at unawares:
3292	And, as I further have to understand,
3293	Is new committed to the Bishop of York,
3294	Fell Warwick's brother and by that our foe.
3295	
3296	RIVERS	These news I must confess are full of grief;
3297	Yet, gracious madam, bear it as you may:
3298	Warwick may lose, that now hath won the day.
3299	
3300	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Till then fair hope must hinder life's decay.
3301	And I the rather wean me from despair
3302	For love of Edward's offspring in my womb:
3303	This is it that makes me bridle passion
3304	And bear with mildness my misfortune's cross;
3305	Ay, ay, for this I draw in many a tear
3306	And stop the rising of blood-sucking sighs,
3307	Lest with my sighs or tears I blast or drown
3308	King Edward's fruit, true heir to the English crown.
3309	
3310	RIVERS	But, madam, where is Warwick then become?
3311	
3312	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I am inform'd that he comes towards London,
3313	To set the crown once more on Henry's head:
3314	Guess thou the rest; King Edward's friends must down,
3315	But, to prevent the tyrant's violence,--
3316	For trust not him that hath once broken faith,--
3317	I'll hence forthwith unto the sanctuary,
3318	To save at least the heir of Edward's right:
3319	There shall I rest secure from force and fraud.
3320	Come, therefore, let us fly while we may fly:
3321	If Warwick take us we are sure to die.

3335	SCENE V	A park near Middleham Castle In Yorkshire.
3336	
3337	
3338	[Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and STANLEY]
3339	
3340	GLOUCESTER	Now, my Lord Hastings and Sir William Stanley,
3341	Leave off to wonder why I drew you hither,
3342	Into this chiefest thicket of the park.
3343	Thus stands the case: you know our king, my brother,
3344	Is prisoner to the bishop here, at whose hands
3345	He hath good usage and great liberty,
3346	And, often but attended with weak guard,
3347	Comes hunting this way to disport himself.
3348	I have advertised him by secret means
3349	That if about this hour he make his way
3350	Under the colour of his usual game,
3351	He shall here find his friends with horse and men
3352	To set him free from his captivity.
3353	
3354	[Enter KING EDWARD IV and a Huntsman with him]
3355	
3356	Huntsman	This way, my lord; for this way lies the game.
3357	
3358	KING EDWARD IV	Nay, this way, man: see where the huntsmen stand.
3359	Now, brother of Gloucester, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
3360	Stand you thus close, to steal the bishop's deer?
3361	
3362	GLOUCESTER	Brother, the time and case requireth haste:
3363	Your horse stands ready at the park-corner.
3364	
3365	KING EDWARD IV	But whither shall we then?
3366	
3367	HASTINGS	To Lynn, my lord,
3368	And ship from thence to Flanders.
3369	
3370	GLOUCESTER	Well guess'd, believe me; for that was my meaning.
3371	
3372	KING EDWARD IV	Stanley, I will requite thy forwardness.
3373	
3374	GLOUCESTER	But wherefore stay we? 'tis no time to talk.
3375	
3376	KING EDWARD IV	Huntsman, what say'st thou? wilt thou go along?
3377	
3378	Huntsman	Better do so than tarry and be hang'd.
3379	
3380	GLOUCESTER	Come then, away; let's ha' no more ado.
3381	
3382	KING EDWARD IV	Bishop, farewell: shield thee from Warwick's frown;
3383	And pray that I may repossess the crown.

3398	
3399	
3400	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, CLARENCE, WARWICK,
3401	SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, OXFORD, MONTAGUE, and
3402	Lieutenant of the Tower]
3403	
3404	KING HENRY VI	Master lieutenant, now that God and friends
3405	Have shaken Edward from the regal seat,
3406	And turn'd my captive state to liberty,
3407	My fear to hope, my sorrows unto joys,
3408	At our enlargement what are thy due fees?
3409	
3410	Lieutenant	Subjects may challenge nothing of their sovereigns;
3411	But if an humble prayer may prevail,
3412	I then crave pardon of your majesty.
3413	
3414	KING HENRY VI	For what, lieutenant? for well using me?
3415	Nay, be thou sure I'll well requite thy kindness,
3416	For that it made my imprisonment a pleasure;
3417	Ay, such a pleasure as incaged birds
3418	Conceive when after many moody thoughts
3419	At last by notes of household harmony
3420	They quite forget their loss of liberty.
3421	But, Warwick, after God, thou set'st me free,
3422	And chiefly therefore I thank God and thee;
3423	He was the author, thou the instrument.
3424	Therefore, that I may conquer fortune's spite
3425	By living low, where fortune cannot hurt me,
3426	And that the people of this blessed land
3427	May not be punish'd with my thwarting stars,
3428	Warwick, although my head still wear the crown,
3429	I here resign my government to thee,
3430	For thou art fortunate in all thy deeds.
3431	
3432	WARWICK	Your grace hath still been famed for virtuous;
3433	And now may seem as wise as virtuous,
3434	By spying and avoiding fortune's malice,
3435	For few men rightly temper with the stars:
3436	Yet in this one thing let me blame your grace,
3437	For choosing me when Clarence is in place.
3438	
3439	CLARENCE	No, Warwick, thou art worthy of the sway,
3440	To whom the heavens in thy nativity
3441	Adjudged an olive branch and laurel crown,
3442	As likely to be blest in peace and war;
3443	And therefore I yield thee my free consent.
3444	
3445	WARWICK	And I choose Clarence only for protector.
3446	
3447	KING HENRY VI	Warwick and Clarence give me both your hands:
3448	Now join your hands, and with your hands your hearts,
3449	That no dissension hinder government:
3450	I make you both protectors of this land,
3451	While I myself will lead a private life
3452	And in devotion spend my latter days,
3453	To sin's rebuke and my Creator's praise.
3454	
3455	WARWICK	What answers Clarence to his sovereign's will?
3456	
3457	CLARENCE	That he consents, if Warwick yield consent;
3458	For on thy fortune I repose myself.
3459	
3460	WARWICK	Why, then, though loath, yet must I be content:
3461	We'll yoke together, like a double shadow
3462	To Henry's body, and supply his place;
3463	I mean, in bearing weight of government,
3464	While he enjoys the honour and his ease.
3465	And, Clarence, now then it is more than needful
3466	Forthwith that Edward be pronounced a traitor,
3467	And all his lands and goods be confiscate.
3468	
3469	CLARENCE	What else? and that succession be determined.
3470	
3471	WARWICK	Ay, therein Clarence shall not want his part.
3472	
3473	KING HENRY VI	But, with the first of all your chief affairs,
3474	Let me entreat, for I command no more,
3475	That Margaret your queen and my son Edward
3476	Be sent for, to return from France with speed;
3477	For, till I see them here, by doubtful fear
3478	My joy of liberty is half eclipsed.
3479	
3480	CLARENCE	It shall be done, my sovereign, with all speed.
3481	
3482	KING HENRY VI	My Lord of Somerset, what youth is that,
3483	Of whom you seem to have so tender care?
3484	
3485	SOMERSET	My liege, it is young Henry, earl of Richmond.
3486	
3487	KING HENRY VI	Come hither, England's hope.
3488	
3489	[Lays his hand on his head]
3490	
3491	If secret powers
3492	Suggest but truth to my divining thoughts,
3493	This pretty lad will prove our country's bliss.
3494	His looks are full of peaceful majesty,
3495	His head by nature framed to wear a crown,
3496	His hand to wield a sceptre, and himself
3497	Likely in time to bless a regal throne.
3498	Make much of him, my lords, for this is he
3499	Must help you more than you are hurt by me.
3500	
3501	[Enter a Post]
3502	
3503	WARWICK	What news, my friend?
3504	
3505	Post	That Edward is escaped from your brother,
3506	And fled, as he hears since, to Burgundy.
3507	
3508	WARWICK	Unsavoury news! but how made he escape?
3509	
3510	Post	He was convey'd by Richard Duke of Gloucester
3511	And the Lord Hastings, who attended him
3512	In secret ambush on the forest side
3513	And from the bishop's huntsmen rescued him;
3514	For hunting was his daily exercise.
3515	
3516	WARWICK	My brother was too careless of his charge.
3517	But let us hence, my sovereign, to provide
3518	A salve for any sore that may betide.
3519	
3520	[Exeunt all but SOMERSET, HENRY OF RICHMOND, and OXFORD]
3521	
3522	SOMERSET	My lord, I like not of this flight of Edward's;
3523	For doubtless Burgundy will yield him help,
3524	And we shall have more wars before 't be long.
3525	As Henry's late presaging prophecy
3526	Did glad my heart with hope of this young Richmond,
3527	So doth my heart misgive me, in these conflicts
3528	What may befall him, to his harm and ours:
3529	Therefore, Lord Oxford, to prevent the worst,
3530	Forthwith we'll send him hence to Brittany,
3531	Till storms be past of civil enmity.
3532	
3533	OXFORD	Ay, for if Edward repossess the crown,
3534	'Tis like that Richmond with the rest shall down.
3535	
3536	SOMERSET	It shall be so; he shall to Brittany.
3537	Come, therefore, let's about it speedily.

3552	
3553	
3554	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,
3555	HASTINGS, and Soldiers]
3556	
3557	KING EDWARD IV	Now, brother Richard, Lord Hastings, and the rest,
3558	Yet thus far fortune maketh us amends,
3559	And says that once more I shall interchange
3560	My waned state for Henry's regal crown.
3561	Well have we pass'd and now repass'd the seas
3562	And brought desired help from Burgundy:
3563	What then remains, we being thus arrived
3564	From Ravenspurgh haven before the gates of York,
3565	But that we enter, as into our dukedom?
3566	
3567	GLOUCESTER	The gates made fast! Brother, I like not this;
3568	For many men that stumble at the threshold
3569	Are well foretold that danger lurks within.
3570	
3571	KING EDWARD IV	Tush, man, abodements must not now affright us:
3572	By fair or foul means we must enter in,
3573	For hither will our friends repair to us.
3574	
3575	HASTINGS	My liege, I'll knock once more to summon them.
3576	
3577	[Enter, on the walls, the Mayor of York, and his Brethren]
3578	
3579	Mayor	My lords, we were forewarned of your coming,
3580	And shut the gates for safety of ourselves;
3581	For now we owe allegiance unto Henry.
3582	
3583	KING EDWARD IV	But, master mayor, if Henry be your king,
3584	Yet Edward at the least is Duke of York.
3585	
3586	Mayor	True, my good lord; I know you for no less.
3587	
3588	KING EDWARD IV	Why, and I challenge nothing but my dukedom,
3589	As being well content with that alone.
3590	
3591	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  But when the fox hath once got in his nose,
3592	He'll soon find means to make the body follow.
3593	
3594	HASTINGS	Why, master mayor, why stand you in a doubt?
3595	Open the gates; we are King Henry's friends.
3596	
3597	Mayor	Ay, say you so? the gates shall then be open'd.
3598	
3599	[They descend]
3600	
3601	GLOUCESTER	A wise stout captain, and soon persuaded!
3602	
3603	HASTINGS	The good old man would fain that all were well,
3604	So 'twere not 'long of him; but being enter'd,
3605	I doubt not, I, but we shall soon persuade
3606	Both him and all his brothers unto reason.
3607	
3608	[Enter the Mayor and two Aldermen, below]
3609	
3610	KING EDWARD IV	So, master mayor: these gates must not be shut
3611	But in the night or in the time of war.
3612	What! fear not, man, but yield me up the keys;
3613	
3614	[Takes his keys]
3615	
3616	For Edward will defend the town and thee,
3617	And all those friends that deign to follow me.
3618	
3619	[March. Enter MONTGOMERY, with drum and soldiers]
3620	
3621	GLOUCESTER	Brother, this is Sir John Montgomery,
3622	Our trusty friend, unless I be deceived.
3623	
3624	KING EDWARD IV	Welcome, Sir John! But why come you in arms?
3625	
3626	MONTAGUE	To help King Edward in his time of storm,
3627	As every loyal subject ought to do.
3628	
3629	KING EDWARD IV	Thanks, good Montgomery; but we now forget
3630	Our title to the crown and only claim
3631	Our dukedom till God please to send the rest.
3632	
3633	MONTAGUE	Then fare you well, for I will hence again:
3634	I came to serve a king and not a duke.
3635	Drummer, strike up, and let us march away.
3636	
3637	[The drum begins to march]
3638	
3639	KING EDWARD IV	Nay, stay, Sir John, awhile, and we'll debate
3640	By what safe means the crown may be recover'd.
3641	
3642	MONTAGUE	What talk you of debating? in few words,
3643	If you'll not here proclaim yourself our king,
3644	I'll leave you to your fortune and be gone
3645	To keep them back that come to succor you:
3646	Why shall we fight, if you pretend no title?
3647	
3648	GLOUCESTER	Why, brother, wherefore stand you on nice points?
3649	
3650	KING EDWARD IV	When we grow stronger, then we'll make our claim:
3651	Till then, 'tis wisdom to conceal our meaning.
3652	
3653	HASTINGS	Away with scrupulous wit! now arms must rule.
3654	
3655	GLOUCESTER	And fearless minds climb soonest unto crowns.
3656	Brother, we will proclaim you out of hand:
3657	The bruit thereof will bring you many friends.
3658	
3659	KING EDWARD IV	Then be it as you will; for 'tis my right,
3660	And Henry but usurps the diadem.
3661	
3662	MONTAGUE	Ay, now my sovereign speaketh like himself;
3663	And now will I be Edward's champion.
3664	
3665	HASTINGS	Sound trumpet; Edward shall be here proclaim'd:
3666	Come, fellow-soldier, make thou proclamation.
3667	
3668	[Flourish]

3670	Soldier	Edward the Fourth, by the grace of God, king of
3671	England and France, and lord of Ireland, &c.

3674	By this I challenge him to single fight.
3675	
3676	[Throws down his gauntlet]
3677	
3678	All	Long live Edward the Fourth!

3680	KING EDWARD IV	Thanks, brave Montgomery; and thanks unto you all:
3681	If fortune serve me, I'll requite this kindness.
3682	Now, for this night, let's harbour here in York;
3683	And when the morning sun shall raise his car
3684	Above the border of this horizon,
3685	We'll forward towards Warwick and his mates;
3686	For well I wot that Henry is no soldier.
3687	Ah, froward Clarence! how evil it beseems thee
3688	To flatter Henry and forsake thy brother!
3689	Yet, as we may, we'll meet both thee and Warwick.
3690	Come on, brave soldiers: doubt not of the day,
3691	And, that once gotten, doubt not of large pay.

3709	CLARENCE, EXETER, and OXFORD]
3710	
3711	WARWICK	What counsel, lords? Edward from Belgia,
3712	With hasty Germans and blunt Hollanders,
3713	Hath pass'd in safety through the narrow seas,
3714	And with his troops doth march amain to London;
3715	And many giddy people flock to him.
3716	
3717	KING HENRY VI	Let's levy men, and beat him back again.
3718	
3719	CLARENCE	A little fire is quickly trodden out;
3720	Which, being suffer'd, rivers cannot quench.
3721	
3722	WARWICK	In Warwickshire I have true-hearted friends,
3723	Not mutinous in peace, yet bold in war;
3724	Those will I muster up: and thou, son Clarence,
3725	Shalt stir up in Suffolk, Norfolk, and in Kent,
3726	The knights and gentlemen to come with thee:
3727	Thou, brother Montague, in Buckingham,
3728	Northampton and in Leicestershire, shalt find
3729	Men well inclined to hear what thou command'st:
3730	And thou, brave Oxford, wondrous well beloved,
3731	In Oxfordshire shalt muster up thy friends.
3732	My sovereign, with the loving citizens,
3733	Like to his island girt in with the ocean,
3734	Or modest Dian circled with her nymphs,
3735	Shall rest in London till we come to him.
3736	Fair lords, take leave and stand not to reply.
3737	Farewell, my sovereign.
3738	
3739	KING HENRY VI	Farewell, my Hector, and my Troy's true hope.
3740	
3741	CLARENCE	In sign of truth, I kiss your highness' hand.
3742

3744	
3745	MONTAGUE	Comfort, my lord; and so I take my leave.

3748	
3749	KING HENRY VI	Sweet Oxford, and my loving Montague,
3750	And all at once, once more a happy farewell.
3751	
3752	WARWICK	Farewell, sweet lords: let's meet at Coventry.
3753	
3754	[Exeunt all but KING HENRY VI and EXETER]
3755	
3756	KING HENRY VI	Here at the palace I will rest awhile.
3757	Cousin of Exeter, what thinks your lordship?
3758	Methinks the power that Edward hath in field
3759	Should not be able to encounter mine.
3760	
3761	EXETER	The doubt is that he will seduce the rest.
3762	
3763	KING HENRY VI	That's not my fear; my meed hath got me fame:
3764	I have not stopp'd mine ears to their demands,
3765	Nor posted off their suits with slow delays;
3766	My pity hath been balm to heal their wounds,
3767	My mildness hath allay'd their swelling griefs,
3768	My mercy dried their water-flowing tears;
3769	I have not been desirous of their wealth,
3770	Nor much oppress'd them with great subsidies.
3771	Nor forward of revenge, though they much err'd:
3772	Then why should they love Edward more than me?
3773	No, Exeter, these graces challenge grace:
3774	And when the lion fawns upon the lamb,
3775	The lamb will never cease to follow him.
3776	
3777	[Shout within. 'A Lancaster! A Lancaster!']
3778	
3779	EXETER	Hark, hark, my lord! what shouts are these?
3780	
3781	[Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, and soldiers]
3782	
3783	KING EDWARD IV	Seize on the shame-faced Henry, bear him hence;
3784	And once again proclaim us King of England.
3785	You are the fount that makes small brooks to flow:
3786	Now stops thy spring; my sea sha$l suck them dry,
3787	And swell so much the higher by their ebb.
3788	Hence with him to the Tower; let him not speak.
3789	
3790	[Exeunt some with KING HENRY VI]
3791	
3792	And, lords, towards Coventry bend we our course
3793	Where peremptory Warwick now remains:
3794	The sun shines hot; and, if we use delay,
3795	Cold biting winter mars our hoped-for hay.
3796	
3797	GLOUCESTER	Away betimes, before his forces join,
3798	And take the great-grown traitor unawares:
3799	Brave warriors, march amain towards Coventry.

3819	WARWICK	Where is the post that came from valiant Oxford?
3820	How far hence is thy lord, mine honest fellow?
3821	
3822	First Messenger	By this at Dunsmore, marching hitherward.
3823	
3824	WARWICK	How far off is our brother Montague?
3825	Where is the post that came from Montague?

3828	
3829	[Enter SIR JOHN SOMERVILLE]
3830

3832	And, by thy guess, how nigh is Clarence now?
3833	
3834	SOMERSET	At Southam I did leave him with his forces,
3835	And do expect him here some two hours hence.
3836	
3837	[Drum heard]
3838	
3839	WARWICK	Then Clarence is at hand, I hear his drum.
3840	
3841	SOMERSET	It is not his, my lord; here Southam lies:
3842	The drum your honour hears marcheth from Warwick.
3843	
3844	WARWICK	Who should that be? belike, unlook'd-for friends.
3845	
3846	SOMERSET	They are at hand, and you shall quickly know.
3847	
3848	[March: flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,

3850	
3851	KING EDWARD IV	Go, trumpet, to the walls, and sound a parle.
3852	
3853	GLOUCESTER	See how the surly Warwick mans the wall!
3854	
3855	WARWICK	O unbid spite! is sportful Edward come?
3856	Where slept our scouts, or how are they seduced,
3857	That we could hear no news of his repair?
3858	
3859	KING EDWARD IV	Now, Warwick, wilt thou ope the city gates,
3860	Speak gentle words and humbly bend thy knee,
3861	Call Edward king and at his hands beg mercy?
3862	And he shall pardon thee these outrages.
3863	
3864	WARWICK	Nay, rather, wilt thou draw thy forces hence,
3865	Confess who set thee up and pluck'd thee own,
3866	Call Warwick patron and be penitent?
3867	And thou shalt still remain the Duke of York.
3868	
3869	GLOUCESTER	I thought, at least, he would have said the king;
3870	Or did he make the jest against his will?
3871	
3872	WARWICK	Is not a dukedom, sir, a goodly gift?
3873	
3874	GLOUCESTER	Ay, by my faith, for a poor earl to give:
3875	I'll do thee service for so good a gift.
3876	
3877	WARWICK	'Twas I that gave the kingdom to thy brother.
3878	
3879	KING EDWARD IV	Why then 'tis mine, if but by Warwick's gift.
3880	
3881	WARWICK	Thou art no Atlas for so great a weight:
3882	And weakling, Warwick takes his gift again;
3883	And Henry is my king, Warwick his subject.
3884	
3885	KING EDWARD IV	But Warwick's king is Edward's prisoner:
3886	And, gallant Warwick, do but answer this:
3887	What is the body when the head is off?
3888	
3889	GLOUCESTER	Alas, that Warwick had no more forecast,
3890	But, whiles he thought to steal the single ten,
3891	The king was slily finger'd from the deck!
3892	You left poor Henry at the Bishop's palace,
3893	And, ten to one, you'll meet him in the Tower.
3894	
3895	EDWARD	'Tis even so; yet you are Warwick still.
3896	
3897	GLOUCESTER	Come, Warwick, take the time; kneel down, kneel down:
3898	Nay, when? strike now, or else the iron cools.
3899	
3900	WARWICK	I had rather chop this hand off at a blow,
3901	And with the other fling it at thy face,
3902	Than bear so low a sail, to strike to thee.
3903	
3904	KING EDWARD IV	Sail how thou canst, have wind and tide thy friend,
3905	This hand, fast wound about thy coal-black hair
3906	Shall, whiles thy head is warm and new cut off,
3907	Write in the dust this sentence with thy blood,
3908	'Wind-changing Warwick now can change no more.'
3909	
3910	[Enter OXFORD, with drum and colours]
3911

3914	OXFORD	Oxford, Oxford, for Lancaster!
3915	
3916	[He and his forces enter the city]
3917	
3918	GLOUCESTER	The gates are open, let us enter too.
3919	
3920	KING EDWARD IV	So other foes may set upon our backs.
3921	Stand we in good array; for they no doubt
3922	Will issue out again and bid us battle:
3923	If not, the city being but of small defence,
3924	We'll quickly rouse the traitors in the same.
3925	
3926	WARWICK	O, welcome, Oxford! for we want thy help.

3932	[He and his forces enter the city]
3933	
3934	GLOUCESTER	Thou and thy brother both shall buy this treason
3935	Even with the dearest blood your bodies bear.
3936

3938	My mind presageth happy gain and conquest.

3947	Have sold their lives unto the house of York;
3948	And thou shalt be the third if this sword hold.
3949	
3950	[Enter CLARENCE, with drum and colours]
3951	
3952	WARWICK	And lo, where George of Clarence sweeps along,
3953	Of force enough to bid his brother battle;
3954	With whom an upright zeal to right prevails
3955	More than the nature of a brother's love!
3956	Come, Clarence, come; thou wilt, if Warwick call.
3957	
3958	CLARENCE	Father of Warwick, know you what this means?
3959	
3960	[Taking his red rose out of his hat]
3961	
3962	Look here, I throw my infamy at thee
3963	I will not ruinate my father's house,
3964	Who gave his blood to lime the stones together,
3965	And set up Lancaster. Why, trow'st thou, Warwick,
3966	That Clarence is so harsh, so blunt, unnatural,
3967	To bend the fatal instruments of war
3968	Against his brother and his lawful king?
3969	Perhaps thou wilt object my holy oath:
3970	To keep that oath were more impiety
3971	Than Jephthah's, when he sacrificed his daughter.
3972	I am so sorry for my trespass made
3973	That, to deserve well at my brother's hands,
3974	I here proclaim myself thy mortal foe,
3975	With resolution, wheresoe'er I meet thee--
3976	As I will meet thee, if thou stir abroad--
3977	To plague thee for thy foul misleading me.
3978	And so, proud-hearted Warwick, I defy thee,
3979	And to my brother turn my blushing cheeks.
3980	Pardon me, Edward, I will make amends:
3981	And, Richard, do not frown upon my faults,
3982	For I will henceforth be no more unconstant.
3983	
3984	KING EDWARD IV	Now welcome more, and ten times more beloved,
3985	Than if thou never hadst deserved our hate.
3986	
3987	GLOUCESTER	Welcome, good Clarence; this is brotherlike.
3988	
3989	WARWICK	O passing traitor, perjured and unjust!
3990	
3991	KING EDWARD IV	What, Warwick, wilt thou leave the town and fight?
3992	Or shall we beat the stones about thine ears?
3993	
3994	WARWICK	Alas, I am not coop'd here for defence!
3995	I will away towards Barnet presently,
3996	And bid thee battle, Edward, if thou darest.
3997

4019	
4020	KING EDWARD IV	So, lie thou there: die thou, and die our fear;
4021	For Warwick was a bug that fear'd us all.
4022	Now, Montague, sit fast; I seek for thee,
4023	That Warwick's bones may keep thine company.
4024	
4025	[Exit]
4026	
4027	WARWICK	Ah, who is nigh? come to me, friend or foe,
4028	And tell me who is victor, York or Warwick?
4029	Why ask I that? my mangled body shows,
4030	My blood, my want of strength, my sick heart shows.
4031	That I must yield my body to the earth
4032	And, by my fall, the conquest to my foe.
4033	Thus yields the cedar to the axe's edge,
4034	Whose arms gave shelter to the princely eagle,
4035	Under whose shade the ramping lion slept,
4036	Whose top-branch overpeer'd Jove's spreading tree
4037	And kept low shrubs from winter's powerful wind.
4038	These eyes, that now are dimm'd with death's black veil,
4039	Have been as piercing as the mid-day sun,
4040	To search the secret treasons of the world:
4041	The wrinkles in my brows, now filled with blood,
4042	Were liken'd oft to kingly sepulchres;
4043	For who lived king, but I could dig his grave?
4044	And who durst mine when Warwick bent his brow?
4045	Lo, now my glory smear'd in dust and blood!
4046	My parks, my walks, my manors that I had.
4047	Even now forsake me, and of all my lands
4048	Is nothing left me but my body's length.
4049	Why, what is pomp, rule, reign, but earth and dust?
4050	And, live we how we can, yet die we must.
4051	
4052	[Enter OXFORD and SOMERSET]
4053	
4054	SOMERSET	Ah, Warwick, Warwick! wert thou as we are.
4055	We might recover all our loss again;
4056	The queen from France hath brought a puissant power:
4057	Even now we heard the news: ah, could'st thou fly!
4058	
4059	WARWICK	Why, then I would not fly. Ah, Montague,
4060	If thou be there, sweet brother, take my hand.
4061	And with thy lips keep in my soul awhile!
4062	Thou lovest me not; for, brother, if thou didst,
4063	Thy tears would wash this cold congealed blood
4064	That glues my lips and will not let me speak.
4065	Come quickly, Montague, or I am dead.
4066	
4067	SOMERSET	Ah, Warwick! Montague hath breathed his last;
4068	And to the latest gasp cried out for Warwick,
4069	And said 'Commend me to my valiant brother.'
4070	And more he would have said, and more he spoke,
4071	Which sounded like a clamour in a vault,
4072	That mought not be distinguished; but at last
4073	I well might hear, delivered with a groan,
4074	'O, farewell, Warwick!'
4075	
4076	WARWICK	Sweet rest his soul! Fly, lords, and save yourselves;

4103	But, in the midst of this bright-shining day,
4104	I spy a black, suspicious, threatening cloud,
4105	That will encounter with our glorious sun,
4106	Ere he attain his easeful western bed:
4107	I mean, my lords, those powers that the queen
4108	Hath raised in Gallia have arrived our coast
4109	And, as we hear, march on to fight with us.
4110	
4111	CLARENCE	A little gale will soon disperse that cloud
4112	And blow it to the source from whence it came:
4113	The very beams will dry those vapours up,
4114	For every cloud engenders not a storm.
4115	
4116	GLOUCESTER	The queen is valued thirty thousand strong,
4117	And Somerset, with Oxford fled to her:

4121	KING EDWARD IV	We are advertised by our loving friends
4122	That they do hold their course toward Tewksbury:
4123	We, having now the best at Barnet field,
4124	Will thither straight, for willingness rids way;

4147	QUEEN MARGARET	Great lords, wise men ne'er sit and wail their loss,
4148	But cheerly seek how to redress their harms.
4149	What though the mast be now blown overboard,
4150	The cable broke, the holding-anchor lost,
4151	And half our sailors swallow'd in the flood?
4152	Yet lives our pilot still. Is't meet that he
4153	Should leave the helm and like a fearful lad
4154	With tearful eyes add water to the sea
4155	And give more strength to that which hath too much,
4156	Whiles, in his moan, the ship splits on the rock,
4157	Which industry and courage might have saved?
4158	Ah, what a shame! ah, what a fault were this!
4159	Say Warwick was our anchor; what of that?
4160	And Montague our topmost; what of him?
4161	Our slaughter'd friends the tackles; what of these?
4162	Why, is not Oxford here another anchor?
4163	And Somerset another goodly mast?
4164	The friends of France our shrouds and tacklings?
4165	And, though unskilful, why not Ned and I
4166	For once allow'd the skilful pilot's charge?
4167	We will not from the helm to sit and weep,
4168	But keep our course, though the rough wind say no,
4169	From shelves and rocks that threaten us with wreck.
4170	As good to chide the waves as speak them fair.
4171	And what is Edward but ruthless sea?
4172	What Clarence but a quicksand of deceit?
4173	And Richard but a ragged fatal rock?
4174	All these the enemies to our poor bark.
4175	Say you can swim; alas, 'tis but a while!
4176	Tread on the sand; why, there you quickly sink:
4177	Bestride the rock; the tide will wash you off,
4178	Or else you famish; that's a threefold death.
4179	This speak I, lords, to let you understand,
4180	If case some one of you would fly from us,
4181	That there's no hoped-for mercy with the brothers
4182	More than with ruthless waves, with sands and rocks.
4183	Why, courage then! what cannot be avoided
4184	'Twere childish weakness to lament or fear.
4185	
4186	PRINCE EDWARD	Methinks a woman of this valiant spirit
4187	Should, if a coward heard her speak these words,
4188	Infuse his breast with magnanimity
4189	And make him, naked, foil a man at arms.
4190	I speak not this as doubting any here
4191	For did I but suspect a fearful man
4192	He should have leave to go away betimes,
4193	Lest in our need he might infect another
4194	And make him of like spirit to himself.
4195	If any such be here--as God forbid!--
4196	Let him depart before we need his help.

4199	And warriors faint! why, 'twere perpetual shame.
4200	O brave young prince! thy famous grandfather
4201	Doth live again in thee: long mayst thou live
4202	To bear his image and renew his glories!
4203	
4204	SOMERSET	And he that will not fight for such a hope.
4205	Go home to bed, and like the owl by day,
4206	If he arise, be mock'd and wonder'd at.
4207	
4208	QUEEN MARGARET	Thanks, gentle Somerset; sweet Oxford, thanks.
4209	
4210	PRINCE EDWARD	And take his thanks that yet hath nothing else.
4211	
4212	[Enter a Messenger]
4213	
4214	Messenger	Prepare you, lords, for Edward is at hand.
4215	Ready to fight; therefore be resolute.
4216	
4217	OXFORD	 I thought no less: it is his policy
4218	To haste thus fast, to find us unprovided.
4219	
4220	SOMERSET	But he's deceived; we are in readiness.
4221	
4222	QUEEN MARGARET	This cheers my heart, to see your forwardness.
4223	
4224	OXFORD	Here pitch our battle; hence we will not budge.
4225	
4226	[Flourish and march. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER,
4227	CLARENCE, and soldiers]
4228	
4229	KING EDWARD IV	Brave followers, yonder stands the thorny wood,
4230	Which, by the heavens' assistance and your strength,
4231	Must by the roots be hewn up yet ere night.
4232	I need not add more fuel to your fire,
4233	For well I wot ye blaze to burn them out
4234	Give signal to the fight, and to it, lords!
4235	
4236	QUEEN MARGARET	Lords, knights, and gentlemen, what I should say
4237	My tears gainsay; for every word I speak,
4238	Ye see, I drink the water of mine eyes.
4239	Therefore, no more but this: Henry, your sovereign,
4240	Is prisoner to the foe; his state usurp'd,
4241	His realm a slaughter-house, his subjects slain,
4242	His statutes cancell'd and his treasure spent;
4243	And yonder is the wolf that makes this spoil.
4244	You fight in justice: then, in God's name, lords,
4245	Be valiant and give signal to the fight.
4246	
4247	[Alarum. Retreat. Excursions. Exeunt]

4254	
4255	ACT V
4256	
4257	
4258	
4259	SCENE V	Another part of the field.
4260	
4261	
4262	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE,
4263	and soldiers; with QUEEN MARGARET, OXFORD, and
4264	SOMERSET, prisoners]
4265	
4266	KING EDWARD IV	Now here a period of tumultuous broils.
4267	Away with Oxford to Hames Castle straight:
4268	For Somerset, off with his guilty head.
4269	Go, bear them hence; I will not hear them speak.
4270	
4271	OXFORD	For my part, I'll not trouble thee with words.
4272	
4273	SOMERSET	Nor I, but stoop with patience to my fortune.
4274	
4275	[Exeunt Oxford and Somerset, guarded]
4276	
4277	QUEEN MARGARET	So part we sadly in this troublous world,
4278	To meet with joy in sweet Jerusalem.
4279	
4280	KING EDWARD IV	Is proclamation made, that who finds Edward
4281	Shall have a high reward, and he his life?
4282	
4283	GLOUCESTER	It is: and lo, where youthful Edward comes!
4284	
4285	[Enter soldiers, with PRINCE EDWARD]
4286	
4287	KING EDWARD IV	Bring forth the gallant, let us hear him speak.
4288	What! can so young a thorn begin to prick?
4289	Edward, what satisfaction canst thou make
4290	For bearing arms, for stirring up my subjects,
4291	And all the trouble thou hast turn'd me to?
4292	
4293	PRINCE EDWARD	Speak like a subject, proud ambitious York!
4294	Suppose that I am now my father's mouth;
4295	Resign thy chair, and where I stand kneel thou,
4296	Whilst I propose the selfsame words to thee,
4297	Which traitor, thou wouldst have me answer to.
4298	
4299	QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, that thy father had been so resolved!
4300	
4301	GLOUCESTER	That you might still have worn the petticoat,
4302	And ne'er have stol'n the breech from Lancaster.
4303	
4304	PRINCE EDWARD	Let AEsop fable in a winter's night;
4305	His currish riddles sort not with this place.
4306	
4307	GLOUCESTER	By heaven, brat, I'll plague ye for that word.
4308	
4309	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, thou wast born to be a plague to men.
4310	
4311	GLOUCESTER	For God's sake, take away this captive scold.
4312	
4313	PRINCE EDWARD	Nay, take away this scolding crookback rather.
4314	
4315	KING EDWARD IV	Peace, wilful boy, or I will charm your tongue.
4316	
4317	CLARENCE	Untutor'd lad, thou art too malapert.
4318	
4319	PRINCE EDWARD	I know my duty; you are all undutiful:
4320	Lascivious Edward, and thou perjured George,
4321	And thou mis-shapen Dick, I tell ye all
4322	I am your better, traitors as ye are:
4323	And thou usurp'st my father's right and mine.
4324	
4325	KING EDWARD IV	Take that, thou likeness of this railer here.
4326	
4327	[Stabs him]
4328	
4329	GLOUCESTER	Sprawl'st thou? take that, to end thy agony.
4330	
4331	[Stabs him]
4332	
4333	CLARENCE	And there's for twitting me with perjury.
4334	
4335	[Stabs him]
4336	
4337	QUEEN MARGARET	O, kill me too!
4338	
4339	GLOUCESTER	Marry, and shall.
4340	
4341	[Offers to kill her]
4342	
4343	KING EDWARD IV	Hold, Richard, hold; for we have done too much.
4344	
4345	GLOUCESTER	Why should she live, to fill the world with words?
4346	
4347	KING EDWARD IV	What, doth she swoon? use means for her recovery.
4348	
4349	GLOUCESTER	Clarence, excuse me to the king my brother;
4350	I'll hence to London on a serious matter:
4351	Ere ye come there, be sure to hear some news.
4352	
4353	CLARENCE	What? what?
4354	
4355	GLOUCESTER	The Tower, the Tower.
4356	
4357	[Exit]
4358	
4359	QUEEN MARGARET	O Ned, sweet Ned! speak to thy mother, boy!
4360	Canst thou not speak? O traitors! murderers!
4361	They that stabb'd Caesar shed no blood at all,
4362	Did not offend, nor were not worthy blame,
4363	If this foul deed were by to equal it:
4364	He was a man; this, in respect, a child:
4365	And men ne'er spend their fury on a child.
4366	What's worse than murderer, that I may name it?
4367	No, no, my heart will burst, and if I speak:
4368	And I will speak, that so my heart may burst.
4369	Butchers and villains! bloody cannibals!
4370	How sweet a plant have you untimely cropp'd!
4371	You have no children, butchers! if you had,
4372	The thought of them would have stirr'd up remorse:
4373	But if you ever chance to have a child,
4374	Look in his youth to have him so cut off
4375	As, deathmen, you have rid this sweet young prince!
4376	
4377	KING EDWARD IV	Away with her; go, bear her hence perforce.
4378	
4379	QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, never bear me hence, dispatch me here,
4380	Here sheathe thy sword, I'll pardon thee my death:
4381	What, wilt thou not? then, Clarence, do it thou.
4382	
4383	CLARENCE	By heaven, I will not do thee so much ease.
4384	
4385	QUEEN MARGARET	Good Clarence, do; sweet Clarence, do thou do it.
4386	
4387	CLARENCE	Didst thou not hear me swear I would not do it?
4388	
4389	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, but thou usest to forswear thyself:
4390	'Twas sin before, but now 'tis charity.
4391	What, wilt thou not? Where is that devil's butcher,
4392	Hard-favour'd Richard? Richard, where art thou?
4393	Thou art not here: murder is thy alms-deed;
4394	Petitioners for blood thou ne'er put'st back.
4395	
4396	KING EDWARD IV	Away, I say; I charge ye, bear her hence.
4397	
4398	QUEEN MARGARET	So come to you and yours, as to this Prince!
4399	
4400	[Exit, led out forcibly]
4401	
4402	KING EDWARD IV	Where's Richard gone?
4403	
4404	CLARENCE	To London, all in post; and, as I guess,
4405	To make a bloody supper in the Tower.
4406	
4407	KING EDWARD IV	He's sudden, if a thing comes in his head.
4408	Now march we hence: discharge the common sort
4409	With pay and thanks, and let's away to London
4410	And see our gentle queen how well she fares:
4411	By this, I hope, she hath a son for me.
4412

4419	
4420	
4421	ACT V
4422	
4423	
4424	
4425	SCENE VI	London. The Tower.
4426	
4427	
4428	[Enter KING HENRY VI and GLOUCESTER, with the
4429	Lieutenant, on the walls]
4430	
4431	GLOUCESTER	Good day, my lord. What, at your book so hard?
4432	
4433	KING HENRY VI	Ay, my good lord:--my lord, I should say rather;
4434	'Tis sin to flatter; 'good' was little better:
4435	'Good Gloucester' and 'good devil' were alike,
4436	And both preposterous; therefore, not 'good lord.'
4437	
4438	GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, leave us to ourselves: we must confer.
4439	
4440	[Exit Lieutenant]
4441	
4442	KING HENRY VI	So flies the reckless shepherd from the wolf;
4443	So first the harmless sheep doth yield his fleece
4444	And next his throat unto the butcher's knife.
4445	What scene of death hath Roscius now to act?
4446	
4447	GLOUCESTER	Suspicion always haunts the guilty mind;
4448	The thief doth fear each bush an officer.
4449	
4450	KING HENRY VI	The bird that hath been limed in a bush,
4451	With trembling wings misdoubteth every bush;
4452	And I, the hapless male to one sweet bird,
4453	Have now the fatal object in my eye
4454	Where my poor young was limed, was caught and kill'd.
4455	
4456	GLOUCESTER	Why, what a peevish fool was that of Crete,
4457	That taught his son the office of a fowl!
4458	An yet, for all his wings, the fool was drown'd.
4459	
4460	KING HENRY VI	I, Daedalus; my poor boy, Icarus;
4461	Thy father, Minos, that denied our course;
4462	The sun that sear'd the wings of my sweet boy
4463	Thy brother Edward, and thyself the sea
4464	Whose envious gulf did swallow up his life.
4465	Ah, kill me with thy weapon, not with words!
4466	My breast can better brook thy dagger's point
4467	Than can my ears that tragic history.
4468	But wherefore dost thou come? is't for my life?
4469	
4470	GLOUCESTER	Think'st thou I am an executioner?
4471	
4472	KING HENRY VI	A persecutor, I am sure, thou art:
4473	If murdering innocents be executing,
4474	Why, then thou art an executioner.
4475	
4476	GLOUCESTER	Thy son I kill'd for his presumption.
4477	
4478	KING HENRY VI	Hadst thou been kill'd when first thou didst presume,
4479	Thou hadst not lived to kill a son of mine.
4480	And thus I prophesy, that many a thousand,
4481	Which now mistrust no parcel of my fear,
4482	And many an old man's sigh and many a widow's,
4483	And many an orphan's water-standing eye--
4484	Men for their sons, wives for their husbands,
4485	And orphans for their parents timeless death--
4486	Shall rue the hour that ever thou wast born.
4487	The owl shriek'd at thy birth,--an evil sign;
4488	The night-crow cried, aboding luckless time;
4489	Dogs howl'd, and hideous tempest shook down trees;
4490	The raven rook'd her on the chimney's top,
4491	And chattering pies in dismal discords sung.
4492	Thy mother felt more than a mother's pain,
4493	And, yet brought forth less than a mother's hope,
4494	To wit, an indigested and deformed lump,
4495	Not like the fruit of such a goodly tree.
4496	Teeth hadst thou in thy head when thou wast born,
4497	To signify thou camest to bite the world:
4498	And, if the rest be true which I have heard,
4499	Thou camest--
4500	
4501	GLOUCESTER	I'll hear no more: die, prophet in thy speech:
4502	
4503	[Stabs him]
4504	
4505	For this amongst the rest, was I ordain'd.
4506	
4507	KING HENRY VI	Ay, and for much more slaughter after this.
4508	God forgive my sins, and pardon thee!
4509	
4510	[Dies]
4511	
4512	GLOUCESTER	What, will the aspiring blood of Lancaster
4513	Sink in the ground? I thought it would have mounted.
4514	See how my sword weeps for the poor king's death!
4515	O, may such purple tears be alway shed
4516	From those that wish the downfall of our house!
4517	If any spark of life be yet remaining,
4518	Down, down to hell; and say I sent thee thither:
4519	
4520	[Stabs him again]
4521	
4522	I, that have neither pity, love, nor fear.
4523	Indeed, 'tis true that Henry told me of;
4524	For I have often heard my mother say
4525	I came into the world with my legs forward:
4526	Had I not reason, think ye, to make haste,
4527	And seek their ruin that usurp'd our right?
4528	The midwife wonder'd and the women cried
4529	'O, Jesus bless us, he is born with teeth!'
4530	And so I was; which plainly signified
4531	That I should snarl and bite and play the dog.
4532	Then, since the heavens have shaped my body so,
4533	Let hell make crook'd my mind to answer it.
4534	I have no brother, I am like no brother;
4535	And this word 'love,' which graybeards call divine,
4536	Be resident in men like one another
4537	And not in me: I am myself alone.
4538	Clarence, beware; thou keep'st me from the light:
4539	But I will sort a pitchy day for thee;
4540	For I will buz abroad such prophecies
4541	That Edward shall be fearful of his life,
4542	And then, to purge his fear, I'll be thy death.
4543	King Henry and the prince his son are gone:
4544	Clarence, thy turn is next, and then the rest,
4545	Counting myself but bad till I be best.
4546	I'll throw thy body in another room
4547	And triumph, Henry, in thy day of doom.
4548	
4549	[Exit, with the body]

4559	
4560	
4561	SCENE VII	London. The palace.
4562	
4563	
4564	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV, QUEEN ELIZABETH,
4565	CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, a Nurse with the
4566	young Prince, and Attendants]
4567	
4568	KING EDWARD IV	Once more we sit in England's royal throne,
4569	Re-purchased with the blood of enemies.
4570	What valiant foemen, like to autumn's corn,
4571	Have we mow'd down, in tops of all their pride!
4572	Three Dukes of Somerset, threefold renown'd
4573	For hardy and undoubted champions;
4574	Two Cliffords, as the father and the son,
4575	And two Northumberlands; two braver men
4576	Ne'er spurr'd their coursers at the trumpet's sound;
4577	With them, the two brave bears, Warwick and Montague,
4578	That in their chains fetter'd the kingly lion
4579	And made the forest tremble when they roar'd.
4580	Thus have we swept suspicion from our seat
4581	And made our footstool of security.
4582	Come hither, Bess, and let me kiss my boy.
4583	Young Ned, for thee, thine uncles and myself
4584	Have in our armours watch'd the winter's night,
4585	Went all afoot in summer's scalding heat,
4586	That thou mightst repossess the crown in peace;
4587	And of our labours thou shalt reap the gain.
4588	
4589	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  I'll blast his harvest, if your head were laid;
4590	For yet I am not look'd on in the world.
4591	This shoulder was ordain'd so thick to heave;
4592	And heave it shall some weight, or break my back:
4593	Work thou the way,--and thou shalt execute.
4594	
4595	KING EDWARD IV	Clarence and Gloucester, love my lovely queen;
4596	And kiss your princely nephew, brothers both.
4597	
4598	CLARENCE	The duty that I owe unto your majesty
4599	I seal upon the lips of this sweet babe.
4600	
4601	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thanks, noble Clarence; worthy brother, thanks.
4602	
4603	GLOUCESTER	And, that I love the tree from whence thou sprang'st,
4604	Witness the loving kiss I give the fruit.
4605	[Aside]  To say the truth, so Judas kiss'd his master,
4606	And cried 'all hail!' when as he meant all harm.
4607	
4608	KING EDWARD IV	Now am I seated as my soul delights,
4609	Having my country's peace and brothers' loves.
4610	
4611	CLARENCE	What will your grace have done with Margaret?
4612	Reignier, her father, to the king of France
4613	Hath pawn'd the Sicils and Jerusalem,
4614	And hither have they sent it for her ransom.
4615	
4616	KING EDWARD IV	Away with her, and waft her hence to France.
4617	And now what rests but that we spend the time
4618	With stately triumphs, mirthful comic shows,
4619	Such as befits the pleasure of the court?
4620	Sound drums and trumpets! farewell sour annoy!
4621	For here, I hope, begins our lasting joy.
4622	
4623	[Exeunt]

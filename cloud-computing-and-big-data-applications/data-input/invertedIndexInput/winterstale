80	
81	
82	
83	[Enter CAMILLO and ARCHIDAMUS]
84	
85	ARCHIDAMUS	If you shall chance, Camillo, to visit Bohemia, on
86	the like occasion whereon my services are now on
87	foot, you shall see, as I have said, great
88	difference betwixt our Bohemia and your Sicilia.
89	
90	CAMILLO	I think, this coming summer, the King of Sicilia
91	means to pay Bohemia the visitation which he justly owes him.
92	
93	ARCHIDAMUS	Wherein our entertainment shall shame us we will be
94	justified in our loves; for indeed--
95	
96	CAMILLO	Beseech you,--
97	
98	ARCHIDAMUS	Verily, I speak it in the freedom of my knowledge:
99	we cannot with such magnificence--in so rare--I know
100	not what to say. We will give you sleepy drinks,
101	that your senses, unintelligent of our insufficience,
102	may, though they cannot praise us, as little accuse
103	us.
104	
105	CAMILLO	You pay a great deal too dear for what's given freely.
106	
107	ARCHIDAMUS	Believe me, I speak as my understanding instructs me
108	and as mine honesty puts it to utterance.
109	
110	CAMILLO	Sicilia cannot show himself over-kind to Bohemia.
111	They were trained together in their childhoods; and
112	there rooted betwixt them then such an affection,
113	which cannot choose but branch now. Since their
114	more mature dignities and royal necessities made
115	separation of their society, their encounters,
116	though not personal, have been royally attorneyed
117	with interchange of gifts, letters, loving
118	embassies; that they have seemed to be together,
119	though absent, shook hands, as over a vast, and
120	embraced, as it were, from the ends of opposed
121	winds. The heavens continue their loves!
122	
123	ARCHIDAMUS	I think there is not in the world either malice or
124	matter to alter it. You have an unspeakable
125	comfort of your young prince Mamillius: it is a
126	gentleman of the greatest promise that ever came
127	into my note.
128	
129	CAMILLO	I very well agree with you in the hopes of him: it
130	is a gallant child; one that indeed physics the
131	subject, makes old hearts fresh: they that went on
132	crutches ere he was born desire yet their life to
133	see him a man.
134	
135	ARCHIDAMUS	Would they else be content to die?
136	
137	CAMILLO	Yes; if there were no other excuse why they should
138	desire to live.
139	
140	ARCHIDAMUS	If the king had no son, they would desire to live
141	on crutches till he had one.

148	THE WINTER'S TALE
149	
150	
151	ACT I
152	
153	
154	
155	SCENE II	A room of state in the same.
156	
157	
158	
159	[Enter LEONTES, HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS,
160	POLIXENES, CAMILLO, and Attendants]
161	
162	POLIXENES	Nine changes of the watery star hath been
163	The shepherd's note since we have left our throne
164	Without a burthen: time as long again
165	Would be find up, my brother, with our thanks;
166	And yet we should, for perpetuity,
167	Go hence in debt: and therefore, like a cipher,
168	Yet standing in rich place, I multiply
169	With one 'We thank you' many thousands moe
170	That go before it.
171	
172	LEONTES	                  Stay your thanks a while;
173	And pay them when you part.
174	
175	POLIXENES	Sir, that's to-morrow.
176	I am question'd by my fears, of what may chance
177	Or breed upon our absence; that may blow
178	No sneaping winds at home, to make us say
179	'This is put forth too truly:' besides, I have stay'd
180	To tire your royalty.
181	
182	LEONTES	We are tougher, brother,
183	Than you can put us to't.
184	
185	POLIXENES	No longer stay.
186	
187	LEONTES	One seven-night longer.
188	
189	POLIXENES	Very sooth, to-morrow.
190	
191	LEONTES	We'll part the time between's then; and in that
192	I'll no gainsaying.
193	
194	POLIXENES	Press me not, beseech you, so.
195	There is no tongue that moves, none, none i' the world,
196	So soon as yours could win me: so it should now,
197	Were there necessity in your request, although
198	'Twere needful I denied it. My affairs
199	Do even drag me homeward: which to hinder
200	Were in your love a whip to me; my stay
201	To you a charge and trouble: to save both,
202	Farewell, our brother.
203	
204	LEONTES	Tongue-tied, our queen?
205	speak you.
206	
207	HERMIONE	I had thought, sir, to have held my peace until
208	You have drawn oaths from him not to stay. You, sir,
209	Charge him too coldly. Tell him, you are sure
210	All in Bohemia's well; this satisfaction
211	The by-gone day proclaim'd: say this to him,
212	He's beat from his best ward.
213	
214	LEONTES	Well said, Hermione.
215	
216	HERMIONE	To tell, he longs to see his son, were strong:
217	But let him say so then, and let him go;
218	But let him swear so, and he shall not stay,
219	We'll thwack him hence with distaffs.
220	Yet of your royal presence I'll adventure
221	The borrow of a week. When at Bohemia
222	You take my lord, I'll give him my commission
223	To let him there a month behind the gest
224	Prefix'd for's parting: yet, good deed, Leontes,
225	I love thee not a jar o' the clock behind
226	What lady-she her lord. You'll stay?
227	
228	POLIXENES	No, madam.
229	
230	HERMIONE	Nay, but you will?
231	
232	POLIXENES	                  I may not, verily.
233	
234	HERMIONE	Verily!
235	You put me off with limber vows; but I,
236	Though you would seek to unsphere the
237	stars with oaths,
238	Should yet say 'Sir, no going.' Verily,
239	You shall not go: a lady's 'Verily' 's
240	As potent as a lord's. Will you go yet?
241	Force me to keep you as a prisoner,
242	Not like a guest; so you shall pay your fees
243	When you depart, and save your thanks. How say you?
244	My prisoner? or my guest? by your dread 'Verily,'
245	One of them you shall be.
246	
247	POLIXENES	Your guest, then, madam:
248	To be your prisoner should import offending;
249	Which is for me less easy to commit
250	Than you to punish.
251	
252	HERMIONE	Not your gaoler, then,
253	But your kind hostess. Come, I'll question you
254	Of my lord's tricks and yours when you were boys:
255	You were pretty lordings then?
256	
257	POLIXENES	We were, fair queen,
258	Two lads that thought there was no more behind
259	But such a day to-morrow as to-day,
260	And to be boy eternal.
261	
262	HERMIONE	Was not my lord
263	The verier wag o' the two?
264	
265	POLIXENES	We were as twinn'd lambs that did frisk i' the sun,
266	And bleat the one at the other: what we changed
267	Was innocence for innocence; we knew not
268	The doctrine of ill-doing, nor dream'd
269	That any did. Had we pursued that life,
270	And our weak spirits ne'er been higher rear'd
271	With stronger blood, we should have answer'd heaven
272	Boldly 'not guilty;' the imposition clear'd
273	Hereditary ours.
274	
275	HERMIONE	                  By this we gather
276	You have tripp'd since.
277	
278	POLIXENES	O my most sacred lady!
279	Temptations have since then been born to's; for
280	In those unfledged days was my wife a girl;
281	Your precious self had then not cross'd the eyes
282	Of my young play-fellow.
283	
284	HERMIONE	Grace to boot!
285	Of this make no conclusion, lest you say
286	Your queen and I are devils: yet go on;
287	The offences we have made you do we'll answer,
288	If you first sinn'd with us and that with us
289	You did continue fault and that you slipp'd not
290	With any but with us.
291	
292	LEONTES	Is he won yet?
293	
294	HERMIONE	He'll stay my lord.
295	
296	LEONTES	At my request he would not.
297	Hermione, my dearest, thou never spokest
298	To better purpose.
299	
300	HERMIONE	                                 Never?
301	
302	LEONTES	Never, but once.
303	
304	HERMIONE	What! have I twice said well? when was't before?
305	I prithee tell me; cram's with praise, and make's
306	As fat as tame things: one good deed dying tongueless
307	Slaughters a thousand waiting upon that.
308	Our praises are our wages: you may ride's
309	With one soft kiss a thousand furlongs ere
310	With spur we beat an acre. But to the goal:
311	My last good deed was to entreat his stay:
312	What was my first? it has an elder sister,
313	Or I mistake you: O, would her name were Grace!
314	But once before I spoke to the purpose: when?
315	Nay, let me have't; I long.
316	
317	LEONTES	Why, that was when
318	Three crabbed months had sour'd themselves to death,
319	Ere I could make thee open thy white hand
320	And clap thyself my love: then didst thou utter
321	'I am yours for ever.'
322	
323	HERMIONE	'Tis grace indeed.
324	Why, lo you now, I have spoke to the purpose twice:
325	The one for ever earn'd a royal husband;
326	The other for some while a friend.
327	
328	LEONTES	[Aside]	Too hot, too hot!
329	To mingle friendship far is mingling bloods.
330	I have tremor cordis on me: my heart dances;
331	But not for joy; not joy. This entertainment
332	May a free face put on, derive a liberty
333	From heartiness, from bounty, fertile bosom,
334	And well become the agent; 't may, I grant;
335	But to be paddling palms and pinching fingers,
336	As now they are, and making practised smiles,
337	As in a looking-glass, and then to sigh, as 'twere
338	The mort o' the deer; O, that is entertainment
339	My bosom likes not, nor my brows! Mamillius,
340	Art thou my boy?
341	
342	MAMILLIUS	                           Ay, my good lord.
343	
344	LEONTES	I' fecks!
345	Why, that's my bawcock. What, hast
346	smutch'd thy nose?
347	They say it is a copy out of mine. Come, captain,
348	We must be neat; not neat, but cleanly, captain:
349	And yet the steer, the heifer and the calf
350	Are all call'd neat.--Still virginalling
351	Upon his palm!--How now, you wanton calf!
352	Art thou my calf?
353	
354	MAMILLIUS	                  Yes, if you will, my lord.
355	
356	LEONTES	Thou want'st a rough pash and the shoots that I have,
357	To be full like me: yet they say we are
358	Almost as like as eggs; women say so,
359	That will say anything but were they false
360	As o'er-dyed blacks, as wind, as waters, false
361	As dice are to be wish'd by one that fixes
362	No bourn 'twixt his and mine, yet were it true
363	To say this boy were like me. Come, sir page,
364	Look on me with your welkin eye: sweet villain!
365	Most dear'st! my collop! Can thy dam?--may't be?--
366	Affection! thy intention stabs the centre:
367	Thou dost make possible things not so held,
368	Communicatest with dreams;--how can this be?--
369	With what's unreal thou coactive art,
370	And fellow'st nothing: then 'tis very credent
371	Thou mayst co-join with something; and thou dost,
372	And that beyond commission, and I find it,
373	And that to the infection of my brains
374	And hardening of my brows.
375	
376	POLIXENES	What means Sicilia?
377	
378	HERMIONE	He something seems unsettled.
379	
380	POLIXENES	How, my lord!
381	What cheer? how is't with you, best brother?
382	
383	HERMIONE	You look as if you held a brow of much distraction
384	Are you moved, my lord?
385	
386	LEONTES	No, in good earnest.
387	How sometimes nature will betray its folly,
388	Its tenderness, and make itself a pastime
389	To harder bosoms! Looking on the lines
390	Of my boy's face, methoughts I did recoil
391	Twenty-three years, and saw myself unbreech'd,
392	In my green velvet coat, my dagger muzzled,
393	Lest it should bite its master, and so prove,
394	As ornaments oft do, too dangerous:
395	How like, methought, I then was to this kernel,
396	This squash, this gentleman. Mine honest friend,
397	Will you take eggs for money?
398	
399	MAMILLIUS	No, my lord, I'll fight.
400	
401	LEONTES	You will! why, happy man be's dole! My brother,
402	Are you so fond of your young prince as we
403	Do seem to be of ours?
404	
405	POLIXENES	If at home, sir,
406	He's all my exercise, my mirth, my matter,
407	Now my sworn friend and then mine enemy,
408	My parasite, my soldier, statesman, all:
409	He makes a July's day short as December,
410	And with his varying childness cures in me
411	Thoughts that would thick my blood.
412	
413	LEONTES	So stands this squire
414	Officed with me: we two will walk, my lord,
415	And leave you to your graver steps. Hermione,
416	How thou lovest us, show in our brother's welcome;
417	Let what is dear in Sicily be cheap:
418	Next to thyself and my young rover, he's
419	Apparent to my heart.
420	
421	HERMIONE	If you would seek us,
422	We are yours i' the garden: shall's attend you there?
423	
424	LEONTES	To your own bents dispose you: you'll be found,
425	Be you beneath the sky.
426	
427	[Aside]
428	
429	I am angling now,
430	Though you perceive me not how I give line.
431	Go to, go to!
432	How she holds up the neb, the bill to him!
433	And arms her with the boldness of a wife
434	To her allowing husband!
435	
436	[Exeunt POLIXENES, HERMIONE, and Attendants]
437	
438	Gone already!
439	Inch-thick, knee-deep, o'er head and
440	ears a fork'd one!
441	Go, play, boy, play: thy mother plays, and I
442	Play too, but so disgraced a part, whose issue
443	Will hiss me to my grave: contempt and clamour
444	Will be my knell. Go, play, boy, play.
445	There have been,
446	Or I am much deceived, cuckolds ere now;
447	And many a man there is, even at this present,
448	Now while I speak this, holds his wife by the arm,
449	That little thinks she has been sluiced in's absence
450	And his pond fish'd by his next neighbour, by
451	Sir Smile, his neighbour: nay, there's comfort in't
452	Whiles other men have gates and those gates open'd,
453	As mine, against their will. Should all despair
454	That have revolted wives, the tenth of mankind
455	Would hang themselves. Physic for't there is none;
456	It is a bawdy planet, that will strike
457	Where 'tis predominant; and 'tis powerful, think it,
458	From east, west, north and south: be it concluded,
459	No barricado for a belly; know't;
460	It will let in and out the enemy
461	With bag and baggage: many thousand on's
462	Have the disease, and feel't not. How now, boy!
463	
464	MAMILLIUS	I am like you, they say.
465	
466	LEONTES	Why that's some comfort. What, Camillo there?
467	
468	CAMILLO	Ay, my good lord.
469	
470	LEONTES	Go play, Mamillius; thou'rt an honest man.
471	
472	[Exit MAMILLIUS]
473	
474	Camillo, this great sir will yet stay longer.
475	
476	CAMILLO	You had much ado to make his anchor hold:
477	When you cast out, it still came home.
478	
479	LEONTES	Didst note it?
480	
481	CAMILLO	He would not stay at your petitions: made
482	His business more material.
483	
484	LEONTES	Didst perceive it?
485	
486	[Aside]
487	
488	They're here with me already, whispering, rounding
489	'Sicilia is a so-forth:' 'tis far gone,
490	When I shall gust it last. How came't, Camillo,
491	That he did stay?
492	
493	CAMILLO	                  At the good queen's entreaty.
494	
495	LEONTES	At the queen's be't: 'good' should be pertinent
496	But, so it is, it is not. Was this taken
497	By any understanding pate but thine?
498	For thy conceit is soaking, will draw in
499	More than the common blocks: not noted, is't,
500	But of the finer natures? by some severals
501	Of head-piece extraordinary? lower messes
502	Perchance are to this business purblind? say.
503	
504	CAMILLO	Business, my lord! I think most understand
505	Bohemia stays here longer.
506	
507	LEONTES	Ha!
508	
509	CAMILLO	Stays here longer.
510	
511	LEONTES	Ay, but why?
512	
513	CAMILLO	To satisfy your highness and the entreaties
514	Of our most gracious mistress.
515	
516	LEONTES	Satisfy!
517	The entreaties of your mistress! satisfy!
518	Let that suffice. I have trusted thee, Camillo,
519	With all the nearest things to my heart, as well
520	My chamber-councils, wherein, priest-like, thou
521	Hast cleansed my bosom, I from thee departed
522	Thy penitent reform'd: but we have been
523	Deceived in thy integrity, deceived
524	In that which seems so.
525	
526	CAMILLO	Be it forbid, my lord!
527	
528	LEONTES	To bide upon't, thou art not honest, or,
529	If thou inclinest that way, thou art a coward,
530	Which hoxes honesty behind, restraining
531	From course required; or else thou must be counted
532	A servant grafted in my serious trust
533	And therein negligent; or else a fool
534	That seest a game play'd home, the rich stake drawn,
535	And takest it all for jest.
536	
537	CAMILLO	My gracious lord,
538	I may be negligent, foolish and fearful;
539	In every one of these no man is free,
540	But that his negligence, his folly, fear,
541	Among the infinite doings of the world,
542	Sometime puts forth. In your affairs, my lord,
543	If ever I were wilful-negligent,
544	It was my folly; if industriously
545	I play'd the fool, it was my negligence,
546	Not weighing well the end; if ever fearful
547	To do a thing, where I the issue doubted,
548	Where of the execution did cry out
549	Against the non-performance, 'twas a fear
550	Which oft infects the wisest: these, my lord,
551	Are such allow'd infirmities that honesty
552	Is never free of. But, beseech your grace,
553	Be plainer with me; let me know my trespass
554	By its own visage: if I then deny it,
555	'Tis none of mine.
556	
557	LEONTES	                  Ha' not you seen, Camillo,--
558	But that's past doubt, you have, or your eye-glass
559	Is thicker than a cuckold's horn,--or heard,--
560	For to a vision so apparent rumour
561	Cannot be mute,--or thought,--for cogitation
562	Resides not in that man that does not think,--
563	My wife is slippery? If thou wilt confess,
564	Or else be impudently negative,
565	To have nor eyes nor ears nor thought, then say
566	My wife's a hobby-horse, deserves a name
567	As rank as any flax-wench that puts to
568	Before her troth-plight: say't and justify't.
569	
570	CAMILLO	I would not be a stander-by to hear
571	My sovereign mistress clouded so, without
572	My present vengeance taken: 'shrew my heart,
573	You never spoke what did become you less
574	Than this; which to reiterate were sin
575	As deep as that, though true.
576	
577	LEONTES	Is whispering nothing?
578	Is leaning cheek to cheek? is meeting noses?
579	Kissing with inside lip? stopping the career
580	Of laughing with a sigh?--a note infallible
581	Of breaking honesty--horsing foot on foot?
582	Skulking in corners? wishing clocks more swift?
583	Hours, minutes? noon, midnight? and all eyes
584	Blind with the pin and web but theirs, theirs only,
585	That would unseen be wicked? is this nothing?
586	Why, then the world and all that's in't is nothing;
587	The covering sky is nothing; Bohemia nothing;
588	My wife is nothing; nor nothing have these nothings,
589	If this be nothing.
590	
591	CAMILLO	Good my lord, be cured
592	Of this diseased opinion, and betimes;
593	For 'tis most dangerous.
594	
595	LEONTES	Say it be, 'tis true.
596	
597	CAMILLO	No, no, my lord.
598	
599	LEONTES	                  It is; you lie, you lie:
600	I say thou liest, Camillo, and I hate thee,
601	Pronounce thee a gross lout, a mindless slave,
602	Or else a hovering temporizer, that
603	Canst with thine eyes at once see good and evil,
604	Inclining to them both: were my wife's liver
605	Infected as her life, she would not live
606	The running of one glass.
607	
608	CAMILLO	Who does infect her?
609	
610	LEONTES	Why, he that wears her like a medal, hanging
611	About his neck, Bohemia: who, if I
612	Had servants true about me, that bare eyes
613	To see alike mine honour as their profits,
614	Their own particular thrifts, they would do that
615	Which should undo more doing: ay, and thou,
616	His cupbearer,--whom I from meaner form
617	Have benched and reared to worship, who mayst see
618	Plainly as heaven sees earth and earth sees heaven,
619	How I am galled,--mightst bespice a cup,
620	To give mine enemy a lasting wink;
621	Which draught to me were cordial.
622	
623	CAMILLO	Sir, my lord,
624	I could do this, and that with no rash potion,
625	But with a lingering dram that should not work
626	Maliciously like poison: but I cannot
627	Believe this crack to be in my dread mistress,
628	So sovereignly being honourable.
629	I have loved thee,--
630	
631	LEONTES	Make that thy question, and go rot!
632	Dost think I am so muddy, so unsettled,
633	To appoint myself in this vexation, sully
634	The purity and whiteness of my sheets,
635	Which to preserve is sleep, which being spotted
636	Is goads, thorns, nettles, tails of wasps,
637	Give scandal to the blood o' the prince my son,
638	Who I do think is mine and love as mine,
639	Without ripe moving to't? Would I do this?
640	Could man so blench?
641	
642	CAMILLO	I must believe you, sir:
643	I do; and will fetch off Bohemia for't;
644	Provided that, when he's removed, your highness
645	Will take again your queen as yours at first,
646	Even for your son's sake; and thereby for sealing
647	The injury of tongues in courts and kingdoms
648	Known and allied to yours.
649	
650	LEONTES	Thou dost advise me
651	Even so as I mine own course have set down:
652	I'll give no blemish to her honour, none.
653	
654	CAMILLO	My lord,
655	Go then; and with a countenance as clear
656	As friendship wears at feasts, keep with Bohemia
657	And with your queen. I am his cupbearer:
658	If from me he have wholesome beverage,
659	Account me not your servant.
660	
661	LEONTES	This is all:
662	Do't and thou hast the one half of my heart;
663	Do't not, thou split'st thine own.
664	
665	CAMILLO	I'll do't, my lord.
666	
667	LEONTES	I will seem friendly, as thou hast advised me.
668	
669	[Exit]
670	
671	CAMILLO	O miserable lady! But, for me,
672	What case stand I in? I must be the poisoner
673	Of good Polixenes; and my ground to do't
674	Is the obedience to a master, one
675	Who in rebellion with himself will have
676	All that are his so too. To do this deed,
677	Promotion follows. If I could find example
678	Of thousands that had struck anointed kings
679	And flourish'd after, I'ld not do't; but since
680	Nor brass nor stone nor parchment bears not one,
681	Let villany itself forswear't. I must
682	Forsake the court: to do't, or no, is certain
683	To me a break-neck. Happy star, reign now!
684	Here comes Bohemia.
685	
686	[Re-enter POLIXENES]
687	
688	POLIXENES	This is strange: methinks
689	My favour here begins to warp. Not speak?
690	Good day, Camillo.
691	
692	CAMILLO	                  Hail, most royal sir!
693	
694	POLIXENES	What is the news i' the court?
695	
696	CAMILLO	None rare, my lord.
697	
698	POLIXENES	The king hath on him such a countenance
699	As he had lost some province and a region
700	Loved as he loves himself: even now I met him
701	With customary compliment; when he,
702	Wafting his eyes to the contrary and falling
703	A lip of much contempt, speeds from me and
704	So leaves me to consider what is breeding
705	That changeth thus his manners.
706	
707	CAMILLO	I dare not know, my lord.
708	
709	POLIXENES	How! dare not! do not. Do you know, and dare not?
710	Be intelligent to me: 'tis thereabouts;
711	For, to yourself, what you do know, you must.
712	And cannot say, you dare not. Good Camillo,
713	Your changed complexions are to me a mirror
714	Which shows me mine changed too; for I must be
715	A party in this alteration, finding
716	Myself thus alter'd with 't.
717	
718	CAMILLO	There is a sickness
719	Which puts some of us in distemper, but
720	I cannot name the disease; and it is caught
721	Of you that yet are well.
722	
723	POLIXENES	How! caught of me!
724	Make me not sighted like the basilisk:
725	I have look'd on thousands, who have sped the better
726	By my regard, but kill'd none so. Camillo,--
727	As you are certainly a gentleman, thereto
728	Clerk-like experienced, which no less adorns
729	Our gentry than our parents' noble names,
730	In whose success we are gentle,--I beseech you,
731	If you know aught which does behove my knowledge
732	Thereof to be inform'd, imprison't not
733	In ignorant concealment.
734	
735	CAMILLO	I may not answer.
736	
737	POLIXENES	A sickness caught of me, and yet I well!
738	I must be answer'd. Dost thou hear, Camillo,
739	I conjure thee, by all the parts of man
740	Which honour does acknowledge, whereof the least
741	Is not this suit of mine, that thou declare
742	What incidency thou dost guess of harm
743	Is creeping toward me; how far off, how near;
744	Which way to be prevented, if to be;
745	If not, how best to bear it.
746	
747	CAMILLO	Sir, I will tell you;
748	Since I am charged in honour and by him
749	That I think honourable: therefore mark my counsel,
750	Which must be even as swiftly follow'd as
751	I mean to utter it, or both yourself and me
752	Cry lost, and so good night!
753	
754	POLIXENES	On, good Camillo.
755	
756	CAMILLO	I am appointed him to murder you.
757	
758	POLIXENES	By whom, Camillo?
759	
760	CAMILLO	                        By the king.
761	
762	POLIXENES	For what?
763	
764	CAMILLO	He thinks, nay, with all confidence he swears,
765	As he had seen't or been an instrument
766	To vice you to't, that you have touch'd his queen
767	Forbiddenly.
768	
769	POLIXENES	                  O, then my best blood turn
770	To an infected jelly and my name
771	Be yoked with his that did betray the Best!
772	Turn then my freshest reputation to
773	A savour that may strike the dullest nostril
774	Where I arrive, and my approach be shunn'd,
775	Nay, hated too, worse than the great'st infection
776	That e'er was heard or read!
777	
778	CAMILLO	Swear his thought over
779	By each particular star in heaven and
780	By all their influences, you may as well
781	Forbid the sea for to obey the moon
782	As or by oath remove or counsel shake
783	The fabric of his folly, whose foundation
784	Is piled upon his faith and will continue
785	The standing of his body.
786	
787	POLIXENES	How should this grow?
788	
789	CAMILLO	I know not: but I am sure 'tis safer to
790	Avoid what's grown than question how 'tis born.
791	If therefore you dare trust my honesty,
792	That lies enclosed in this trunk which you
793	Shall bear along impawn'd, away to-night!
794	Your followers I will whisper to the business,
795	And will by twos and threes at several posterns
796	Clear them o' the city. For myself, I'll put
797	My fortunes to your service, which are here
798	By this discovery lost. Be not uncertain;
799	For, by the honour of my parents, I
800	Have utter'd truth: which if you seek to prove,
801	I dare not stand by; nor shall you be safer
802	Than one condemn'd by the king's own mouth, thereon
803	His execution sworn.
804	
805	POLIXENES	I do believe thee:
806	I saw his heart in 's face. Give me thy hand:
807	Be pilot to me and thy places shall
808	Still neighbour mine. My ships are ready and
809	My people did expect my hence departure
810	Two days ago. This jealousy
811	Is for a precious creature: as she's rare,
812	Must it be great, and as his person's mighty,
813	Must it be violent, and as he does conceive
814	He is dishonour'd by a man which ever
815	Profess'd to him, why, his revenges must
816	In that be made more bitter. Fear o'ershades me:
817	Good expedition be my friend, and comfort
818	The gracious queen, part of his theme, but nothing
819	Of his ill-ta'en suspicion! Come, Camillo;
820	I will respect thee as a father if
821	Thou bear'st my life off hence: let us avoid.
822	
823	CAMILLO	It is in mine authority to command
824	The keys of all the posterns: please your highness
825	To take the urgent hour. Come, sir, away.
826	
827	[Exeunt]

832	THE WINTER'S TALE
833	
834	
835	ACT II
836	
837	
838	
839	SCENE I	A room in LEONTES' palace.
840	
841	
842	[Enter HERMIONE, MAMILLIUS, and Ladies]
843	
844	HERMIONE	Take the boy to you: he so troubles me,
845	'Tis past enduring.
846	
847	First Lady	Come, my gracious lord,
848	Shall I be your playfellow?
849	
850	MAMILLIUS	No, I'll none of you.
851	
852	First Lady	Why, my sweet lord?
853	
854	MAMILLIUS	You'll kiss me hard and speak to me as if
855	I were a baby still. I love you better.
856	
857	Second Lady	And why so, my lord?
858	
859	MAMILLIUS	Not for because
860	Your brows are blacker; yet black brows, they say,
861	Become some women best, so that there be not
862	Too much hair there, but in a semicircle
863	Or a half-moon made with a pen.
864	
865	Second Lady	Who taught you this?
866	
867	MAMILLIUS	I learnt it out of women's faces. Pray now
868	What colour are your eyebrows?
869	
870	First Lady	Blue, my lord.
871	
872	MAMILLIUS	Nay, that's a mock: I have seen a lady's nose
873	That has been blue, but not her eyebrows.
874	
875	First Lady	Hark ye;
876	The queen your mother rounds apace: we shall
877	Present our services to a fine new prince
878	One of these days; and then you'ld wanton with us,
879	If we would have you.
880	
881	Second Lady	She is spread of late
882	Into a goodly bulk: good time encounter her!
883	
884	HERMIONE	What wisdom stirs amongst you? Come, sir, now
885	I am for you again: pray you, sit by us,
886	And tell 's a tale.
887	
888	MAMILLIUS	Merry or sad shall't be?
889	
890	HERMIONE	As merry as you will.
891	
892	MAMILLIUS	A sad tale's best for winter: I have one
893	Of sprites and goblins.
894	
895	HERMIONE	Let's have that, good sir.
896	Come on, sit down: come on, and do your best
897	To fright me with your sprites; you're powerful at it.
898	
899	MAMILLIUS	There was a man--
900	
901	HERMIONE	                  Nay, come, sit down; then on.
902	
903	MAMILLIUS	Dwelt by a churchyard: I will tell it softly;
904	Yond crickets shall not hear it.
905	
906	HERMIONE	Come on, then,
907	And give't me in mine ear.
908	
909	[Enter LEONTES, with ANTIGONUS, Lords and others]
910	
911	LEONTES	Was he met there? his train? Camillo with him?
912	
913	First Lord	Behind the tuft of pines I met them; never
914	Saw I men scour so on their way: I eyed them
915	Even to their ships.
916	
917	LEONTES	How blest am I
918	In my just censure, in my true opinion!
919	Alack, for lesser knowledge! how accursed
920	In being so blest! There may be in the cup
921	A spider steep'd, and one may drink, depart,
922	And yet partake no venom, for his knowledge
923	Is not infected: but if one present
924	The abhorr'd ingredient to his eye, make known
925	How he hath drunk, he cracks his gorge, his sides,
926	With violent hefts. I have drunk,
927	and seen the spider.
928	Camillo was his help in this, his pander:
929	There is a plot against my life, my crown;
930	All's true that is mistrusted: that false villain
931	Whom I employ'd was pre-employ'd by him:
932	He has discover'd my design, and I
933	Remain a pinch'd thing; yea, a very trick
934	For them to play at will. How came the posterns
935	So easily open?
936	
937	First Lord	                  By his great authority;
938	Which often hath no less prevail'd than so
939	On your command.
940	
941	LEONTES	                          I know't too well.
942	Give me the boy: I am glad you did not nurse him:
943	Though he does bear some signs of me, yet you
944	Have too much blood in him.
945	
946	HERMIONE	What is this? sport?
947	
948	LEONTES	Bear the boy hence; he shall not come about her;
949	Away with him! and let her sport herself
950	With that she's big with; for 'tis Polixenes
951	Has made thee swell thus.
952	
953	HERMIONE	But I'ld say he had not,
954	And I'll be sworn you would believe my saying,
955	Howe'er you lean to the nayward.
956	
957	LEONTES	You, my lords,
958	Look on her, mark her well; be but about
959	To say 'she is a goodly lady,' and
960	The justice of your bearts will thereto add
961	'Tis pity she's not honest, honourable:'
962	Praise her but for this her without-door form,
963	Which on my faith deserves high speech, and straight
964	The shrug, the hum or ha, these petty brands
965	That calumny doth use--O, I am out--
966	That mercy does, for calumny will sear
967	Virtue itself: these shrugs, these hums and ha's,
968	When you have said 'she's goodly,' come between
969	Ere you can say 'she's honest:' but be 't known,
970	From him that has most cause to grieve it should be,
971	She's an adulteress.
972	
973	HERMIONE	Should a villain say so,
974	The most replenish'd villain in the world,
975	He were as much more villain: you, my lord,
976	Do but mistake.
977	
978	LEONTES	                  You have mistook, my lady,
979	Polixenes for Leontes: O thou thing!
980	Which I'll not call a creature of thy place,
981	Lest barbarism, making me the precedent,
982	Should a like language use to all degrees
983	And mannerly distinguishment leave out
984	Betwixt the prince and beggar: I have said
985	She's an adulteress; I have said with whom:
986	More, she's a traitor and Camillo is
987	A federary with her, and one that knows
988	What she should shame to know herself
989	But with her most vile principal, that she's
990	A bed-swerver, even as bad as those
991	That vulgars give bold'st titles, ay, and privy
992	To this their late escape.
993	
994	HERMIONE	No, by my life.
995	Privy to none of this. How will this grieve you,
996	When you shall come to clearer knowledge, that
997	You thus have publish'd me! Gentle my lord,
998	You scarce can right me throughly then to say
999	You did mistake.
1000	
1001	LEONTES	                  No; if I mistake
1002	In those foundations which I build upon,
1003	The centre is not big enough to bear
1004	A school-boy's top. Away with her! to prison!
1005	He who shall speak for her is afar off guilty
1006	But that he speaks.
1007	
1008	HERMIONE	There's some ill planet reigns:
1009	I must be patient till the heavens look
1010	With an aspect more favourable. Good my lords,
1011	I am not prone to weeping, as our sex
1012	Commonly are; the want of which vain dew
1013	Perchance shall dry your pities: but I have
1014	That honourable grief lodged here which burns
1015	Worse than tears drown: beseech you all, my lords,
1016	With thoughts so qualified as your charities
1017	Shall best instruct you, measure me; and so
1018	The king's will be perform'd!
1019	
1020	LEONTES	Shall I be heard?
1021	
1022	HERMIONE	Who is't that goes with me? Beseech your highness,
1023	My women may be with me; for you see
1024	My plight requires it. Do not weep, good fools;
1025	There is no cause: when you shall know your mistress
1026	Has deserved prison, then abound in tears
1027	As I come out: this action I now go on
1028	Is for my better grace. Adieu, my lord:
1029	I never wish'd to see you sorry; now
1030	I trust I shall. My women, come; you have leave.
1031	
1032	LEONTES	Go, do our bidding; hence!
1033	
1034	[Exit HERMIONE, guarded; with Ladies]
1035	
1036	First Lord	Beseech your highness, call the queen again.
1037	
1038	ANTIGONUS	Be certain what you do, sir, lest your justice
1039	Prove violence; in the which three great ones suffer,
1040	Yourself, your queen, your son.
1041	
1042	First Lord	For her, my lord,
1043	I dare my life lay down and will do't, sir,
1044	Please you to accept it, that the queen is spotless
1045	I' the eyes of heaven and to you; I mean,
1046	In this which you accuse her.
1047	
1048	ANTIGONUS	If it prove
1049	She's otherwise, I'll keep my stables where
1050	I lodge my wife; I'll go in couples with her;
1051	Than when I feel and see her no farther trust her;
1052	For every inch of woman in the world,
1053	Ay, every dram of woman's flesh is false, If she be.
1054	
1055	LEONTES	         Hold your peaces.
1056	
1057	First Lord	Good my lord,--
1058	
1059	ANTIGONUS	It is for you we speak, not for ourselves:
1060	You are abused and by some putter-on
1061	That will be damn'd for't; would I knew the villain,
1062	I would land-damn him. Be she honour-flaw'd,
1063	I have three daughters; the eldest is eleven
1064	The second and the third, nine, and some five;
1065	If this prove true, they'll pay for't:
1066	by mine honour,
1067	I'll geld 'em all; fourteen they shall not see,
1068	To bring false generations: they are co-heirs;
1069	And I had rather glib myself than they
1070	Should not produce fair issue.
1071	
1072	LEONTES	Cease; no more.
1073	You smell this business with a sense as cold
1074	As is a dead man's nose: but I do see't and feel't
1075	As you feel doing thus; and see withal
1076	The instruments that feel.
1077	
1078	ANTIGONUS	If it be so,
1079	We need no grave to bury honesty:
1080	There's not a grain of it the face to sweeten
1081	Of the whole dungy earth.
1082	
1083	LEONTES	What! lack I credit?
1084	
1085	First Lord	I had rather you did lack than I, my lord,
1086	Upon this ground; and more it would content me
1087	To have her honour true than your suspicion,
1088	Be blamed for't how you might.
1089	
1090	LEONTES	Why, what need we
1091	Commune with you of this, but rather follow
1092	Our forceful instigation? Our prerogative
1093	Calls not your counsels, but our natural goodness
1094	Imparts this; which if you, or stupefied
1095	Or seeming so in skill, cannot or will not
1096	Relish a truth like us, inform yourselves
1097	We need no more of your advice: the matter,
1098	The loss, the gain, the ordering on't, is all
1099	Properly ours.
1100	
1101	ANTIGONUS	                  And I wish, my liege,
1102	You had only in your silent judgment tried it,
1103	Without more overture.
1104	
1105	LEONTES	How could that be?
1106	Either thou art most ignorant by age,
1107	Or thou wert born a fool. Camillo's flight,
1108	Added to their familiarity,
1109	Which was as gross as ever touch'd conjecture,
1110	That lack'd sight only, nought for approbation
1111	But only seeing, all other circumstances
1112	Made up to the deed, doth push on this proceeding:
1113	Yet, for a greater confirmation,
1114	For in an act of this importance 'twere
1115	Most piteous to be wild, I have dispatch'd in post
1116	To sacred Delphos, to Apollo's temple,
1117	Cleomenes and Dion, whom you know
1118	Of stuff'd sufficiency: now from the oracle
1119	They will bring all; whose spiritual counsel had,
1120	Shall stop or spur me. Have I done well?
1121	
1122	First Lord	Well done, my lord.
1123	
1124	LEONTES	Though I am satisfied and need no more
1125	Than what I know, yet shall the oracle
1126	Give rest to the minds of others, such as he
1127	Whose ignorant credulity will not
1128	Come up to the truth. So have we thought it good
1129	From our free person she should be confined,
1130	Lest that the treachery of the two fled hence
1131	Be left her to perform. Come, follow us;
1132	We are to speak in public; for this business
1133	Will raise us all.
1134	
1135	ANTIGONUS	[Aside]
1136	
1137	To laughter, as I take it,
1138	If the good truth were known.

1151	
1152	SCENE II	A prison.
1153	
1154	
1155	[Enter PAULINA, a Gentleman, and Attendants]
1156	
1157	PAULINA	The keeper of the prison, call to him;
1158	let him have knowledge who I am.
1159	
1160	[Exit Gentleman]
1161	
1162	Good lady,
1163	No court in Europe is too good for thee;
1164	What dost thou then in prison?
1165	
1166	[Re-enter Gentleman, with the Gaoler]
1167	
1168	Now, good sir,
1169	You know me, do you not?
1170	
1171	Gaoler	For a worthy lady
1172	And one whom much I honour.
1173	
1174	PAULINA	Pray you then,
1175	Conduct me to the queen.
1176	
1177	Gaoler	I may not, madam:
1178	To the contrary I have express commandment.
1179	
1180	PAULINA	Here's ado,
1181	To lock up honesty and honour from
1182	The access of gentle visitors!
1183	Is't lawful, pray you,
1184	To see her women? any of them? Emilia?
1185	
1186	Gaoler	So please you, madam,
1187	To put apart these your attendants, I
1188	Shall bring Emilia forth.
1189	
1190	PAULINA	I pray now, call her.
1191	Withdraw yourselves.
1192	
1193	[Exeunt Gentleman and Attendants]
1194	
1195	Gaoler	And, madam,
1196	I must be present at your conference.
1197	
1198	PAULINA	Well, be't so, prithee.
1199	
1200	[Exit Gaoler]
1201	
1202	Here's such ado to make no stain a stain
1203	As passes colouring.
1204	
1205	[Re-enter Gaoler, with EMILIA]
1206	
1207	Dear gentlewoman,
1208	How fares our gracious lady?
1209	
1210	EMILIA	As well as one so great and so forlorn
1211	May hold together: on her frights and griefs,
1212	Which never tender lady hath born greater,
1213	She is something before her time deliver'd.
1214	
1215	PAULINA	A boy?
1216	
1217	EMILIA	     A daughter, and a goodly babe,
1218	Lusty and like to live: the queen receives
1219	Much comfort in't; says 'My poor prisoner,
1220	I am innocent as you.'
1221	
1222	PAULINA	I dare be sworn
1223	These dangerous unsafe lunes i' the king,
1224	beshrew them!
1225	He must be told on't, and he shall: the office
1226	Becomes a woman best; I'll take't upon me:
1227	If I prove honey-mouth'd let my tongue blister
1228	And never to my red-look'd anger be
1229	The trumpet any more. Pray you, Emilia,
1230	Commend my best obedience to the queen:
1231	If she dares trust me with her little babe,
1232	I'll show't the king and undertake to be
1233	Her advocate to the loud'st. We do not know
1234	How he may soften at the sight o' the child:
1235	The silence often of pure innocence
1236	Persuades when speaking fails.
1237	
1238	EMILIA	Most worthy madam,
1239	Your honour and your goodness is so evident
1240	That your free undertaking cannot miss
1241	A thriving issue: there is no lady living
1242	So meet for this great errand. Please your ladyship
1243	To visit the next room, I'll presently
1244	Acquaint the queen of your most noble offer;
1245	Who but to-day hammer'd of this design,
1246	But durst not tempt a minister of honour,
1247	Lest she should be denied.
1248	
1249	PAULINA	Tell her, Emilia.
1250	I'll use that tongue I have: if wit flow from't
1251	As boldness from my bosom, let 't not be doubted
1252	I shall do good.
1253	
1254	EMILIA	                  Now be you blest for it!
1255	I'll to the queen: please you,
1256	come something nearer.
1257	
1258	Gaoler	Madam, if't please the queen to send the babe,
1259	I know not what I shall incur to pass it,
1260	Having no warrant.
1261	
1262	PAULINA	                  You need not fear it, sir:
1263	This child was prisoner to the womb and is
1264	By law and process of great nature thence
1265	Freed and enfranchised, not a party to
1266	The anger of the king nor guilty of,
1267	If any be, the trespass of the queen.
1268	
1269	Gaoler	I do believe it.
1270	
1271	PAULINA	                  Do not you fear: upon mine honour,
1272	I will stand betwixt you and danger.

1281	
1282	ACT II
1283	
1284	
1285	
1286	SCENE III	A room in LEONTES' palace.
1287	
1288	
1289	[Enter LEONTES, ANTIGONUS, Lords, and Servants]
1290	
1291	LEONTES	Nor night nor day no rest: it is but weakness
1292	To bear the matter thus; mere weakness. If
1293	The cause were not in being,--part o' the cause,
1294	She the adulteress; for the harlot king
1295	Is quite beyond mine arm, out of the blank
1296	And level of my brain, plot-proof; but she
1297	I can hook to me: say that she were gone,
1298	Given to the fire, a moiety of my rest
1299	Might come to me again. Who's there?
1300	
1301	First Servant	My lord?
1302	
1303	LEONTES	How does the boy?
1304	
1305	First Servant	                  He took good rest to-night;
1306	'Tis hoped his sickness is discharged.
1307	
1308	LEONTES	To see his nobleness!
1309	Conceiving the dishonour of his mother,
1310	He straight declined, droop'd, took it deeply,
1311	Fasten'd and fix'd the shame on't in himself,
1312	Threw off his spirit, his appetite, his sleep,
1313	And downright languish'd. Leave me solely: go,
1314	See how he fares.
1315	
1316	[Exit Servant]
1317	
1318	Fie, fie! no thought of him:
1319	The thought of my revenges that way
1320	Recoil upon me: in himself too mighty,
1321	And in his parties, his alliance; let him be
1322	Until a time may serve: for present vengeance,
1323	Take it on her. Camillo and Polixenes
1324	Laugh at me, make their pastime at my sorrow:
1325	They should not laugh if I could reach them, nor
1326	Shall she within my power.
1327	
1328	[Enter PAULINA, with a child]
1329	
1330	First Lord	You must not enter.
1331	
1332	PAULINA	Nay, rather, good my lords, be second to me:
1333	Fear you his tyrannous passion more, alas,
1334	Than the queen's life? a gracious innocent soul,
1335	More free than he is jealous.
1336	
1337	ANTIGONUS	That's enough.
1338	
1339	Second Servant	Madam, he hath not slept tonight; commanded
1340	None should come at him.
1341	
1342	PAULINA	Not so hot, good sir:
1343	I come to bring him sleep. 'Tis such as you,
1344	That creep like shadows by him and do sigh
1345	At each his needless heavings, such as you
1346	Nourish the cause of his awaking: I
1347	Do come with words as medicinal as true,
1348	Honest as either, to purge him of that humour
1349	That presses him from sleep.
1350	
1351	LEONTES	What noise there, ho?
1352	
1353	PAULINA	No noise, my lord; but needful conference
1354	About some gossips for your highness.
1355	
1356	LEONTES	How!
1357	Away with that audacious lady! Antigonus,
1358	I charged thee that she should not come about me:
1359	I knew she would.
1360	
1361	ANTIGONUS	                  I told her so, my lord,
1362	On your displeasure's peril and on mine,
1363	She should not visit you.
1364	
1365	LEONTES	What, canst not rule her?
1366	
1367	PAULINA	From all dishonesty he can: in this,
1368	Unless he take the course that you have done,
1369	Commit me for committing honour, trust it,
1370	He shall not rule me.
1371	
1372	ANTIGONUS	La you now, you hear:
1373	When she will take the rein I let her run;
1374	But she'll not stumble.
1375	
1376	PAULINA	Good my liege, I come;
1377	And, I beseech you, hear me, who profess
1378	Myself your loyal servant, your physician,
1379	Your most obedient counsellor, yet that dare
1380	Less appear so in comforting your evils,
1381	Than such as most seem yours: I say, I come
1382	From your good queen.
1383	
1384	LEONTES	Good queen!
1385	
1386	PAULINA	Good queen, my lord,
1387	Good queen; I say good queen;
1388	And would by combat make her good, so were I
1389	A man, the worst about you.
1390	
1391	LEONTES	Force her hence.
1392	
1393	PAULINA	Let him that makes but trifles of his eyes
1394	First hand me: on mine own accord I'll off;
1395	But first I'll do my errand. The good queen,
1396	For she is good, hath brought you forth a daughter;
1397	Here 'tis; commends it to your blessing.
1398	
1399	[Laying down the child]
1400	
1401	LEONTES	Out!
1402	A mankind witch! Hence with her, out o' door:
1403	A most intelligencing bawd!
1404	
1405	PAULINA	Not so:
1406	I am as ignorant in that as you
1407	In so entitling me, and no less honest
1408	Than you are mad; which is enough, I'll warrant,
1409	As this world goes, to pass for honest.
1410	
1411	LEONTES	Traitors!
1412	Will you not push her out? Give her the bastard.
1413	Thou dotard! thou art woman-tired, unroosted
1414	By thy dame Partlet here. Take up the bastard;
1415	Take't up, I say; give't to thy crone.
1416	
1417	PAULINA	For ever
1418	Unvenerable be thy hands, if thou
1419	Takest up the princess by that forced baseness
1420	Which he has put upon't!
1421	
1422	LEONTES	He dreads his wife.
1423	
1424	PAULINA	So I would you did; then 'twere past all doubt
1425	You'ld call your children yours.
1426	
1427	LEONTES	A nest of traitors!
1428	
1429	ANTIGONUS	I am none, by this good light.
1430	
1431	PAULINA	Nor I, nor any
1432	But one that's here, and that's himself, for he
1433	The sacred honour of himself, his queen's,
1434	His hopeful son's, his babe's, betrays to slander,
1435	Whose sting is sharper than the sword's;
1436	and will not--
1437	For, as the case now stands, it is a curse
1438	He cannot be compell'd to't--once remove
1439	The root of his opinion, which is rotten
1440	As ever oak or stone was sound.
1441	
1442	LEONTES	A callat
1443	Of boundless tongue, who late hath beat her husband
1444	And now baits me! This brat is none of mine;
1445	It is the issue of Polixenes:
1446	Hence with it, and together with the dam
1447	Commit them to the fire!
1448	
1449	PAULINA	It is yours;
1450	And, might we lay the old proverb to your charge,
1451	So like you, 'tis the worse. Behold, my lords,
1452	Although the print be little, the whole matter
1453	And copy of the father, eye, nose, lip,
1454	The trick of's frown, his forehead, nay, the valley,
1455	The pretty dimples of his chin and cheek,
1456	His smiles,
1457	The very mould and frame of hand, nail, finger:
1458	And thou, good goddess Nature, which hast made it
1459	So like to him that got it, if thou hast
1460	The ordering of the mind too, 'mongst all colours
1461	No yellow in't, lest she suspect, as he does,
1462	Her children not her husband's!
1463	
1464	LEONTES	A gross hag
1465	And, lozel, thou art worthy to be hang'd,
1466	That wilt not stay her tongue.
1467	
1468	ANTIGONUS	Hang all the husbands
1469	That cannot do that feat, you'll leave yourself
1470	Hardly one subject.
1471	
1472	LEONTES	Once more, take her hence.
1473	
1474	PAULINA	A most unworthy and unnatural lord
1475	Can do no more.
1476	
1477	LEONTES	                  I'll ha' thee burnt.
1478	
1479	PAULINA	I care not:
1480	It is an heretic that makes the fire,
1481	Not she which burns in't. I'll not call you tyrant;
1482	But this most cruel usage of your queen,
1483	Not able to produce more accusation
1484	Than your own weak-hinged fancy, something savours
1485	Of tyranny and will ignoble make you,
1486	Yea, scandalous to the world.
1487	
1488	LEONTES	On your allegiance,
1489	Out of the chamber with her! Were I a tyrant,
1490	Where were her life? she durst not call me so,
1491	If she did know me one. Away with her!
1492	
1493	PAULINA	I pray you, do not push me; I'll be gone.
1494	Look to your babe, my lord; 'tis yours:
1495	Jove send her
1496	A better guiding spirit! What needs these hands?
1497	You, that are thus so tender o'er his follies,
1498	Will never do him good, not one of you.
1499	So, so: farewell; we are gone.
1500	
1501	[Exit]
1502	
1503	LEONTES	Thou, traitor, hast set on thy wife to this.
1504	My child? away with't! Even thou, that hast
1505	A heart so tender o'er it, take it hence
1506	And see it instantly consumed with fire;
1507	Even thou and none but thou. Take it up straight:
1508	Within this hour bring me word 'tis done,
1509	And by good testimony, or I'll seize thy life,
1510	With what thou else call'st thine. If thou refuse
1511	And wilt encounter with my wrath, say so;
1512	The bastard brains with these my proper hands
1513	Shall I dash out. Go, take it to the fire;
1514	For thou set'st on thy wife.
1515	
1516	ANTIGONUS	I did not, sir:
1517	These lords, my noble fellows, if they please,
1518	Can clear me in't.
1519	
1520	Lords	                  We can: my royal liege,
1521	He is not guilty of her coming hither.
1522	
1523	LEONTES	You're liars all.
1524	
1525	First Lord	Beseech your highness, give us better credit:
1526	We have always truly served you, and beseech you
1527	So to esteem of us, and on our knees we beg,
1528	As recompense of our dear services
1529	Past and to come, that you do change this purpose,
1530	Which being so horrible, so bloody, must
1531	Lead on to some foul issue: we all kneel.
1532	
1533	LEONTES	I am a feather for each wind that blows:
1534	Shall I live on to see this bastard kneel
1535	And call me father? better burn it now
1536	Than curse it then. But be it; let it live.
1537	It shall not neither. You, sir, come you hither;
1538	You that have been so tenderly officious
1539	With Lady Margery, your midwife there,
1540	To save this bastard's life,--for 'tis a bastard,
1541	So sure as this beard's grey,
1542	--what will you adventure
1543	To save this brat's life?
1544	
1545	ANTIGONUS	Any thing, my lord,
1546	That my ability may undergo
1547	And nobleness impose: at least thus much:
1548	I'll pawn the little blood which I have left
1549	To save the innocent: any thing possible.
1550	
1551	LEONTES	It shall be possible. Swear by this sword
1552	Thou wilt perform my bidding.
1553	
1554	ANTIGONUS	I will, my lord.
1555	
1556	LEONTES	Mark and perform it, see'st thou! for the fail
1557	Of any point in't shall not only be
1558	Death to thyself but to thy lewd-tongued wife,
1559	Whom for this time we pardon. We enjoin thee,
1560	As thou art liege-man to us, that thou carry
1561	This female bastard hence and that thou bear it
1562	To some remote and desert place quite out
1563	Of our dominions, and that there thou leave it,
1564	Without more mercy, to its own protection
1565	And favour of the climate. As by strange fortune
1566	It came to us, I do in justice charge thee,
1567	On thy soul's peril and thy body's torture,
1568	That thou commend it strangely to some place
1569	Where chance may nurse or end it. Take it up.
1570	
1571	ANTIGONUS	I swear to do this, though a present death
1572	Had been more merciful. Come on, poor babe:
1573	Some powerful spirit instruct the kites and ravens
1574	To be thy nurses! Wolves and bears, they say
1575	Casting their savageness aside have done
1576	Like offices of pity. Sir, be prosperous
1577	In more than this deed does require! And blessing
1578	Against this cruelty fight on thy side,
1579	Poor thing, condemn'd to loss!
1580	
1581	[Exit with the child]
1582	
1583	LEONTES	No, I'll not rear
1584	Another's issue.
1585	
1586	[Enter a Servant]
1587	
1588	Servant	                  Please your highness, posts
1589	From those you sent to the oracle are come
1590	An hour since: Cleomenes and Dion,
1591	Being well arrived from Delphos, are both landed,
1592	Hasting to the court.
1593	
1594	First Lord	So please you, sir, their speed
1595	Hath been beyond account.
1596	
1597	LEONTES	Twenty-three days
1598	They have been absent: 'tis good speed; foretells
1599	The great Apollo suddenly will have
1600	The truth of this appear. Prepare you, lords;
1601	Summon a session, that we may arraign
1602	Our most disloyal lady, for, as she hath
1603	Been publicly accused, so shall she have
1604	A just and open trial. While she lives
1605	My heart will be a burthen to me. Leave me,
1606	And think upon my bidding.

1621	
1622	
1623	
1624	[Enter CLEOMENES and DION]
1625	
1626	CLEOMENES	The climate's delicate, the air most sweet,
1627	Fertile the isle, the temple much surpassing
1628	The common praise it bears.
1629	
1630	DION	I shall report,
1631	For most it caught me, the celestial habits,
1632	Methinks I so should term them, and the reverence
1633	Of the grave wearers. O, the sacrifice!
1634	How ceremonious, solemn and unearthly
1635	It was i' the offering!
1636	
1637	CLEOMENES	But of all, the burst
1638	And the ear-deafening voice o' the oracle,
1639	Kin to Jove's thunder, so surprised my sense.
1640	That I was nothing.
1641	
1642	DION	If the event o' the journey
1643	Prove as successful to the queen,--O be't so!--
1644	As it hath been to us rare, pleasant, speedy,
1645	The time is worth the use on't.
1646	
1647	CLEOMENES	Great Apollo
1648	Turn all to the best! These proclamations,
1649	So forcing faults upon Hermione,
1650	I little like.
1651	
1652	DION	                  The violent carriage of it
1653	Will clear or end the business: when the oracle,
1654	Thus by Apollo's great divine seal'd up,
1655	Shall the contents discover, something rare
1656	Even then will rush to knowledge. Go: fresh horses!
1657	And gracious be the issue!

1667	ACT III
1668	
1669	
1670	
1671	SCENE II	A court of Justice.
1672	
1673	
1674	[Enter LEONTES, Lords, and Officers]
1675	
1676	LEONTES	This sessions, to our great grief we pronounce,
1677	Even pushes 'gainst our heart: the party tried
1678	The daughter of a king, our wife, and one
1679	Of us too much beloved. Let us be clear'd
1680	Of being tyrannous, since we so openly
1681	Proceed in justice, which shall have due course,
1682	Even to the guilt or the purgation.
1683	Produce the prisoner.
1684	
1685	Officer	It is his highness' pleasure that the queen
1686	Appear in person here in court. Silence!
1687	
1688	[Enter HERMIONE guarded;
1689	PAULINA and Ladies attending]
1690	
1691	LEONTES	Read the indictment.
1692	
1693	Officer	[Reads]            Hermione, queen to the worthy
1694	Leontes, king of Sicilia, thou art here accused and
1695	arraigned of high treason, in committing adultery
1696	with Polixenes, king of Bohemia, and conspiring
1697	with Camillo to take away the life of our sovereign
1698	lord the king, thy royal husband: the pretence
1699	whereof being by circumstances partly laid open,
1700	thou, Hermione, contrary to the faith and allegiance
1701	of a true subject, didst counsel and aid them, for
1702	their better safety, to fly away by night.
1703	
1704	HERMIONE	Since what I am to say must be but that
1705	Which contradicts my accusation and
1706	The testimony on my part no other
1707	But what comes from myself, it shall scarce boot me
1708	To say 'not guilty:' mine integrity
1709	Being counted falsehood, shall, as I express it,
1710	Be so received. But thus: if powers divine
1711	Behold our human actions, as they do,
1712	I doubt not then but innocence shall make
1713	False accusation blush and tyranny
1714	Tremble at patience. You, my lord, best know,
1715	Who least will seem to do so, my past life
1716	Hath been as continent, as chaste, as true,
1717	As I am now unhappy; which is more
1718	Than history can pattern, though devised
1719	And play'd to take spectators. For behold me
1720	A fellow of the royal bed, which owe
1721	A moiety of the throne a great king's daughter,
1722	The mother to a hopeful prince, here standing
1723	To prate and talk for life and honour 'fore
1724	Who please to come and hear. For life, I prize it
1725	As I weigh grief, which I would spare: for honour,
1726	'Tis a derivative from me to mine,
1727	And only that I stand for. I appeal
1728	To your own conscience, sir, before Polixenes
1729	Came to your court, how I was in your grace,
1730	How merited to be so; since he came,
1731	With what encounter so uncurrent I
1732	Have strain'd to appear thus: if one jot beyond
1733	The bound of honour, or in act or will
1734	That way inclining, harden'd be the hearts
1735	Of all that hear me, and my near'st of kin
1736	Cry fie upon my grave!
1737	
1738	LEONTES	I ne'er heard yet
1739	That any of these bolder vices wanted
1740	Less impudence to gainsay what they did
1741	Than to perform it first.
1742	
1743	HERMIONE	That's true enough;
1744	Through 'tis a saying, sir, not due to me.
1745	
1746	LEONTES	You will not own it.
1747	
1748	HERMIONE	More than mistress of
1749	Which comes to me in name of fault, I must not
1750	At all acknowledge. For Polixenes,
1751	With whom I am accused, I do confess
1752	I loved him as in honour he required,
1753	With such a kind of love as might become
1754	A lady like me, with a love even such,
1755	So and no other, as yourself commanded:
1756	Which not to have done I think had been in me
1757	Both disobedience and ingratitude
1758	To you and toward your friend, whose love had spoke,
1759	Even since it could speak, from an infant, freely
1760	That it was yours. Now, for conspiracy,
1761	I know not how it tastes; though it be dish'd
1762	For me to try how: all I know of it
1763	Is that Camillo was an honest man;
1764	And why he left your court, the gods themselves,
1765	Wotting no more than I, are ignorant.
1766	
1767	LEONTES	You knew of his departure, as you know
1768	What you have underta'en to do in's absence.
1769	
1770	HERMIONE	Sir,
1771	You speak a language that I understand not:
1772	My life stands in the level of your dreams,
1773	Which I'll lay down.
1774	
1775	LEONTES	Your actions are my dreams;
1776	You had a bastard by Polixenes,
1777	And I but dream'd it. As you were past all shame,--
1778	Those of your fact are so--so past all truth:
1779	Which to deny concerns more than avails; for as
1780	Thy brat hath been cast out, like to itself,
1781	No father owning it,--which is, indeed,
1782	More criminal in thee than it,--so thou
1783	Shalt feel our justice, in whose easiest passage
1784	Look for no less than death.
1785	
1786	HERMIONE	Sir, spare your threats:
1787	The bug which you would fright me with I seek.
1788	To me can life be no commodity:
1789	The crown and comfort of my life, your favour,
1790	I do give lost; for I do feel it gone,
1791	But know not how it went. My second joy
1792	And first-fruits of my body, from his presence
1793	I am barr'd, like one infectious. My third comfort
1794	Starr'd most unluckily, is from my breast,
1795	The innocent milk in its most innocent mouth,
1796	Haled out to murder: myself on every post
1797	Proclaimed a strumpet: with immodest hatred
1798	The child-bed privilege denied, which 'longs
1799	To women of all fashion; lastly, hurried
1800	Here to this place, i' the open air, before
1801	I have got strength of limit. Now, my liege,
1802	Tell me what blessings I have here alive,
1803	That I should fear to die? Therefore proceed.
1804	But yet hear this: mistake me not; no life,
1805	I prize it not a straw, but for mine honour,
1806	Which I would free, if I shall be condemn'd
1807	Upon surmises, all proofs sleeping else
1808	But what your jealousies awake, I tell you
1809	'Tis rigor and not law. Your honours all,
1810	I do refer me to the oracle:
1811	Apollo be my judge!
1812	
1813	First Lord	This your request
1814	Is altogether just: therefore bring forth,
1815	And in Apollos name, his oracle.
1816	
1817	[Exeunt certain Officers]
1818	
1819	HERMIONE	The Emperor of Russia was my father:
1820	O that he were alive, and here beholding
1821	His daughter's trial! that he did but see
1822	The flatness of my misery, yet with eyes
1823	Of pity, not revenge!
1824	
1825	[Re-enter Officers, with CLEOMENES and DION]
1826	
1827	Officer	You here shall swear upon this sword of justice,
1828	That you, Cleomenes and Dion, have
1829	Been both at Delphos, and from thence have brought
1830	The seal'd-up oracle, by the hand deliver'd
1831	Of great Apollo's priest; and that, since then,
1832	You have not dared to break the holy seal
1833	Nor read the secrets in't.
1834	
1835	
1836	CLEOMENES	|
1837	|	All this we swear.
1838	DION	|
1839	
1840	
1841	LEONTES	Break up the seals and read.
1842	
1843	Officer	[Reads]	Hermione is chaste;
1844	Polixenes blameless; Camillo a true subject; Leontes
1845	a jealous tyrant; his innocent babe truly begotten;
1846	and the king shall live without an heir, if that
1847	which is lost be not found.
1848	
1849	Lords	Now blessed be the great Apollo!
1850	
1851	HERMIONE	Praised!
1852	
1853	LEONTES	Hast thou read truth?
1854	
1855	Officer	Ay, my lord; even so
1856	As it is here set down.
1857	
1858	LEONTES	There is no truth at all i' the oracle:
1859	The sessions shall proceed: this is mere falsehood.
1860	
1861	[Enter Servant]
1862	
1863	Servant	My lord the king, the king!
1864	
1865	LEONTES	What is the business?
1866	
1867	Servant	O sir, I shall be hated to report it!
1868	The prince your son, with mere conceit and fear
1869	Of the queen's speed, is gone.
1870	
1871	LEONTES	How! gone!
1872	
1873	Servant	Is dead.
1874	
1875	LEONTES	Apollo's angry; and the heavens themselves
1876	Do strike at my injustice.
1877	
1878	[HERMIONE swoons]
1879	
1880	How now there!
1881	
1882	PAULINA	This news is mortal to the queen: look down
1883	And see what death is doing.
1884	
1885	LEONTES	Take her hence:
1886	Her heart is but o'ercharged; she will recover:
1887	I have too much believed mine own suspicion:
1888	Beseech you, tenderly apply to her
1889	Some remedies for life.
1890	
1891	[Exeunt PAULINA and Ladies, with HERMIONE]
1892	
1893	Apollo, pardon
1894	My great profaneness 'gainst thine oracle!
1895	I'll reconcile me to Polixenes,
1896	New woo my queen, recall the good Camillo,
1897	Whom I proclaim a man of truth, of mercy;
1898	For, being transported by my jealousies
1899	To bloody thoughts and to revenge, I chose
1900	Camillo for the minister to poison
1901	My friend Polixenes: which had been done,
1902	But that the good mind of Camillo tardied
1903	My swift command, though I with death and with
1904	Reward did threaten and encourage him,
1905	Not doing 't and being done: he, most humane
1906	And fill'd with honour, to my kingly guest
1907	Unclasp'd my practise, quit his fortunes here,
1908	Which you knew great, and to the hazard
1909	Of all encertainties himself commended,
1910	No richer than his honour: how he glisters
1911	Thorough my rust! and how his pity
1912	Does my deeds make the blacker!
1913	
1914	[Re-enter PAULINA]
1915	
1916	PAULINA	Woe the while!
1917	O, cut my lace, lest my heart, cracking it,
1918	Break too.
1919	
1920	First Lord	          What fit is this, good lady?
1921	
1922	PAULINA	What studied torments, tyrant, hast for me?
1923	What wheels? racks? fires? what flaying? boiling?
1924	In leads or oils? what old or newer torture
1925	Must I receive, whose every word deserves
1926	To taste of thy most worst? Thy tyranny
1927	Together working with thy jealousies,
1928	Fancies too weak for boys, too green and idle
1929	For girls of nine, O, think what they have done
1930	And then run mad indeed, stark mad! for all
1931	Thy by-gone fooleries were but spices of it.
1932	That thou betray'dst Polixenes,'twas nothing;
1933	That did but show thee, of a fool, inconstant
1934	And damnable ingrateful: nor was't much,
1935	Thou wouldst have poison'd good Camillo's honour,
1936	To have him kill a king: poor trespasses,
1937	More monstrous standing by: whereof I reckon
1938	The casting forth to crows thy baby-daughter
1939	To be or none or little; though a devil
1940	Would have shed water out of fire ere done't:
1941	Nor is't directly laid to thee, the death
1942	Of the young prince, whose honourable thoughts,
1943	Thoughts high for one so tender, cleft the heart
1944	That could conceive a gross and foolish sire
1945	Blemish'd his gracious dam: this is not, no,
1946	Laid to thy answer: but the last,--O lords,
1947	When I have said, cry 'woe!' the queen, the queen,
1948	The sweet'st, dear'st creature's dead,
1949	and vengeance for't
1950	Not dropp'd down yet.
1951	
1952	First Lord	The higher powers forbid!
1953	
1954	PAULINA	I say she's dead; I'll swear't. If word nor oath
1955	Prevail not, go and see: if you can bring
1956	Tincture or lustre in her lip, her eye,
1957	Heat outwardly or breath within, I'll serve you
1958	As I would do the gods. But, O thou tyrant!
1959	Do not repent these things, for they are heavier
1960	Than all thy woes can stir; therefore betake thee
1961	To nothing but despair. A thousand knees
1962	Ten thousand years together, naked, fasting,
1963	Upon a barren mountain and still winter
1964	In storm perpetual, could not move the gods
1965	To look that way thou wert.
1966	
1967	LEONTES	Go on, go on
1968	Thou canst not speak too much; I have deserved
1969	All tongues to talk their bitterest.
1970	
1971	First Lord	Say no more:
1972	Howe'er the business goes, you have made fault
1973	I' the boldness of your speech.
1974	
1975	PAULINA	I am sorry for't:
1976	All faults I make, when I shall come to know them,
1977	I do repent. Alas! I have show'd too much
1978	The rashness of a woman: he is touch'd
1979	To the noble heart. What's gone and what's past help
1980	Should be past grief: do not receive affliction
1981	At my petition; I beseech you, rather
1982	Let me be punish'd, that have minded you
1983	Of what you should forget. Now, good my liege
1984	Sir, royal sir, forgive a foolish woman:
1985	The love I bore your queen--lo, fool again!--
1986	I'll speak of her no more, nor of your children;
1987	I'll not remember you of my own lord,
1988	Who is lost too: take your patience to you,
1989	And I'll say nothing.
1990	
1991	LEONTES	Thou didst speak but well
1992	When most the truth; which I receive much better
1993	Than to be pitied of thee. Prithee, bring me
1994	To the dead bodies of my queen and son:
1995	One grave shall be for both: upon them shall
1996	The causes of their death appear, unto
1997	Our shame perpetual. Once a day I'll visit
1998	The chapel where they lie, and tears shed there
1999	Shall be my recreation: so long as nature
2000	Will bear up with this exercise, so long
2001	I daily vow to use it. Come and lead me
2002	Unto these sorrows.

2015	
2016	SCENE III	Bohemia. A desert country near the sea.
2017	
2018	
2019	[Enter ANTIGONUS with a Child, and a Mariner]
2020	
2021	ANTIGONUS	Thou art perfect then, our ship hath touch'd upon
2022	The deserts of Bohemia?
2023	
2024	Mariner	Ay, my lord: and fear
2025	We have landed in ill time: the skies look grimly
2026	And threaten present blusters. In my conscience,
2027	The heavens with that we have in hand are angry
2028	And frown upon 's.
2029	
2030	ANTIGONUS	Their sacred wills be done! Go, get aboard;
2031	Look to thy bark: I'll not be long before
2032	I call upon thee.
2033	
2034	Mariner	Make your best haste, and go not
2035	Too far i' the land: 'tis like to be loud weather;
2036	Besides, this place is famous for the creatures
2037	Of prey that keep upon't.
2038	
2039	ANTIGONUS	Go thou away:
2040	I'll follow instantly.
2041	
2042	Mariner	I am glad at heart
2043	To be so rid o' the business.
2044	
2045	[Exit]
2046	
2047	ANTIGONUS	Come, poor babe:
2048	I have heard, but not believed,
2049	the spirits o' the dead
2050	May walk again: if such thing be, thy mother
2051	Appear'd to me last night, for ne'er was dream
2052	So like a waking. To me comes a creature,
2053	Sometimes her head on one side, some another;
2054	I never saw a vessel of like sorrow,
2055	So fill'd and so becoming: in pure white robes,
2056	Like very sanctity, she did approach
2057	My cabin where I lay; thrice bow'd before me,
2058	And gasping to begin some speech, her eyes
2059	Became two spouts: the fury spent, anon
2060	Did this break-from her: 'Good Antigonus,
2061	Since fate, against thy better disposition,
2062	Hath made thy person for the thrower-out
2063	Of my poor babe, according to thine oath,
2064	Places remote enough are in Bohemia,
2065	There weep and leave it crying; and, for the babe
2066	Is counted lost for ever, Perdita,
2067	I prithee, call't. For this ungentle business
2068	Put on thee by my lord, thou ne'er shalt see
2069	Thy wife Paulina more.' And so, with shrieks
2070	She melted into air. Affrighted much,
2071	I did in time collect myself and thought
2072	This was so and no slumber. Dreams are toys:
2073	Yet for this once, yea, superstitiously,
2074	I will be squared by this. I do believe
2075	Hermione hath suffer'd death, and that
2076	Apollo would, this being indeed the issue
2077	Of King Polixenes, it should here be laid,
2078	Either for life or death, upon the earth
2079	Of its right father. Blossom, speed thee well!
2080	There lie, and there thy character: there these;
2081	Which may, if fortune please, both breed thee, pretty,
2082	And still rest thine. The storm begins; poor wretch,
2083	That for thy mother's fault art thus exposed
2084	To loss and what may follow! Weep I cannot,
2085	But my heart bleeds; and most accursed am I
2086	To be by oath enjoin'd to this. Farewell!
2087	The day frowns more and more: thou'rt like to have
2088	A lullaby too rough: I never saw
2089	The heavens so dim by day. A savage clamour!
2090	Well may I get aboard! This is the chase:
2091	I am gone for ever.
2092	
2093	[Exit, pursued by a bear]
2094	
2095	[Enter a Shepherd]
2096	
2097	Shepherd	I would there were no age between sixteen and
2098	three-and-twenty, or that youth would sleep out the
2099	rest; for there is nothing in the between but
2100	getting wenches with child, wronging the ancientry,
2101	stealing, fighting--Hark you now! Would any but
2102	these boiled brains of nineteen and two-and-twenty
2103	hunt this weather? They have scared away two of my
2104	best sheep, which I fear the wolf will sooner find
2105	than the master: if any where I have them, 'tis by
2106	the seaside, browsing of ivy. Good luck, an't be thy
2107	will what have we here! Mercy on 's, a barne a very
2108	pretty barne! A boy or a child, I wonder? A
2109	pretty one; a very pretty one: sure, some 'scape:
2110	though I am not bookish, yet I can read
2111	waiting-gentlewoman in the 'scape. This has been
2112	some stair-work, some trunk-work, some
2113	behind-door-work: they were warmer that got this
2114	than the poor thing is here. I'll take it up for
2115	pity: yet I'll tarry till my son come; he hallooed
2116	but even now. Whoa, ho, hoa!
2117	
2118	[Enter Clown]
2119	
2120	Clown	Hilloa, loa!
2121	
2122	Shepherd	What, art so near? If thou'lt see a thing to talk
2123	on when thou art dead and rotten, come hither. What
2124	ailest thou, man?
2125	
2126	Clown	I have seen two such sights, by sea and by land!
2127	but I am not to say it is a sea, for it is now the
2128	sky: betwixt the firmament and it you cannot thrust
2129	a bodkin's point.
2130	
2131	Shepherd	Why, boy, how is it?
2132	
2133	Clown	I would you did but see how it chafes, how it rages,
2134	how it takes up the shore! but that's not the
2135	point. O, the most piteous cry of the poor souls!
2136	sometimes to see 'em, and not to see 'em; now the
2137	ship boring the moon with her main-mast, and anon
2138	swallowed with yest and froth, as you'ld thrust a
2139	cork into a hogshead. And then for the
2140	land-service, to see how the bear tore out his
2141	shoulder-bone; how he cried to me for help and said
2142	his name was Antigonus, a nobleman. But to make an
2143	end of the ship, to see how the sea flap-dragoned
2144	it: but, first, how the poor souls roared, and the
2145	sea mocked them; and how the poor gentleman roared
2146	and the bear mocked him, both roaring louder than
2147	the sea or weather.
2148	
2149	Shepherd	Name of mercy, when was this, boy?
2150	
2151	Clown	Now, now: I have not winked since I saw these
2152	sights: the men are not yet cold under water, nor
2153	the bear half dined on the gentleman: he's at it
2154	now.
2155	
2156	Shepherd	Would I had been by, to have helped the old man!
2157	
2158	Clown	I would you had been by the ship side, to have
2159	helped her: there your charity would have lacked footing.
2160	
2161	Shepherd	Heavy matters! heavy matters! but look thee here,
2162	boy. Now bless thyself: thou mettest with things
2163	dying, I with things newborn. Here's a sight for
2164	thee; look thee, a bearing-cloth for a squire's
2165	child! look thee here; take up, take up, boy;
2166	open't. So, let's see: it was told me I should be
2167	rich by the fairies. This is some changeling:
2168	open't. What's within, boy?
2169	
2170	Clown	You're a made old man: if the sins of your youth
2171	are forgiven you, you're well to live. Gold! all gold!
2172	
2173	Shepherd	This is fairy gold, boy, and 'twill prove so: up
2174	with't, keep it close: home, home, the next way.
2175	We are lucky, boy; and to be so still requires
2176	nothing but secrecy. Let my sheep go: come, good
2177	boy, the next way home.
2178	
2179	Clown	Go you the next way with your findings. I'll go see
2180	if the bear be gone from the gentleman and how much
2181	he hath eaten: they are never curst but when they
2182	are hungry: if there be any of him left, I'll bury
2183	it.
2184	
2185	Shepherd	That's a good deed. If thou mayest discern by that
2186	which is left of him what he is, fetch me to the
2187	sight of him.
2188	
2189	Clown	Marry, will I; and you shall help to put him i' the ground.
2190	
2191	Shepherd	'Tis a lucky day, boy, and we'll do good deeds on't.

2208	[Enter Time, the Chorus]
2209	
2210	Time	I, that please some, try all, both joy and terror
2211	Of good and bad, that makes and unfolds error,
2212	Now take upon me, in the name of Time,
2213	To use my wings. Impute it not a crime
2214	To me or my swift passage, that I slide
2215	O'er sixteen years and leave the growth untried
2216	Of that wide gap, since it is in my power
2217	To o'erthrow law and in one self-born hour
2218	To plant and o'erwhelm custom. Let me pass
2219	The same I am, ere ancient'st order was
2220	Or what is now received: I witness to
2221	The times that brought them in; so shall I do
2222	To the freshest things now reigning and make stale
2223	The glistering of this present, as my tale
2224	Now seems to it. Your patience this allowing,
2225	I turn my glass and give my scene such growing
2226	As you had slept between: Leontes leaving,
2227	The effects of his fond jealousies so grieving
2228	That he shuts up himself, imagine me,
2229	Gentle spectators, that I now may be
2230	In fair Bohemia, and remember well,
2231	I mentioned a son o' the king's, which Florizel
2232	I now name to you; and with speed so pace
2233	To speak of Perdita, now grown in grace
2234	Equal with wondering: what of her ensues
2235	I list not prophecy; but let Time's news
2236	Be known when 'tis brought forth.
2237	A shepherd's daughter,
2238	And what to her adheres, which follows after,
2239	Is the argument of Time. Of this allow,
2240	If ever you have spent time worse ere now;
2241	If never, yet that Time himself doth say
2242	He wishes earnestly you never may.

2252	ACT IV
2253	
2254	
2255	
2256	SCENE II	Bohemia. The palace of POLIXENES.
2257	
2258	
2259	[Enter POLIXENES and CAMILLO]
2260	
2261	POLIXENES	I pray thee, good Camillo, be no more importunate:
2262	'tis a sickness denying thee any thing; a death to
2263	grant this.
2264	
2265	CAMILLO	It is fifteen years since I saw my country: though
2266	I have for the most part been aired abroad, I
2267	desire to lay my bones there. Besides, the penitent
2268	king, my master, hath sent for me; to whose feeling
2269	sorrows I might be some allay, or I o'erween to
2270	think so, which is another spur to my departure.
2271	
2272	POLIXENES	As thou lovest me, Camillo, wipe not out the rest of
2273	thy services by leaving me now: the need I have of
2274	thee thine own goodness hath made; better not to
2275	have had thee than thus to want thee: thou, having
2276	made me businesses which none without thee can
2277	sufficiently manage, must either stay to execute
2278	them thyself or take away with thee the very
2279	services thou hast done; which if I have not enough
2280	considered, as too much I cannot, to be more
2281	thankful to thee shall be my study, and my profit
2282	therein the heaping friendships. Of that fatal
2283	country, Sicilia, prithee speak no more; whose very
2284	naming punishes me with the remembrance of that
2285	penitent, as thou callest him, and reconciled king,
2286	my brother; whose loss of his most precious queen
2287	and children are even now to be afresh lamented.
2288	Say to me, when sawest thou the Prince Florizel, my
2289	son? Kings are no less unhappy, their issue not
2290	being gracious, than they are in losing them when
2291	they have approved their virtues.
2292	
2293	CAMILLO	Sir, it is three days since I saw the prince. What
2294	his happier affairs may be, are to me unknown: but I
2295	have missingly noted, he is of late much retired
2296	from court and is less frequent to his princely
2297	exercises than formerly he hath appeared.
2298	
2299	POLIXENES	I have considered so much, Camillo, and with some
2300	care; so far that I have eyes under my service which
2301	look upon his removedness; from whom I have this
2302	intelligence, that he is seldom from the house of a
2303	most homely shepherd; a man, they say, that from
2304	very nothing, and beyond the imagination of his
2305	neighbours, is grown into an unspeakable estate.
2306	
2307	CAMILLO	I have heard, sir, of such a man, who hath a
2308	daughter of most rare note: the report of her is
2309	extended more than can be thought to begin from such a cottage.
2310	
2311	POLIXENES	That's likewise part of my intelligence; but, I
2312	fear, the angle that plucks our son thither. Thou
2313	shalt accompany us to the place; where we will, not
2314	appearing what we are, have some question with the
2315	shepherd; from whose simplicity I think it not
2316	uneasy to get the cause of my son's resort thither.
2317	Prithee, be my present partner in this business, and
2318	lay aside the thoughts of Sicilia.
2319	
2320	CAMILLO	I willingly obey your command.
2321	
2322	POLIXENES	My best Camillo! We must disguise ourselves.

2337	
2338	
2339	[Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing]
2340	
2341	AUTOLYCUS	When daffodils begin to peer,
2342	With heigh! the doxy over the dale,
2343	Why, then comes in the sweet o' the year;
2344	For the red blood reigns in the winter's pale.
2345	
2346	The white sheet bleaching on the hedge,
2347	With heigh! the sweet birds, O, how they sing!
2348	Doth set my pugging tooth on edge;
2349	For a quart of ale is a dish for a king.
2350	
2351	The lark, that tirra-lyra chants,
2352	With heigh! with heigh! the thrush and the jay,
2353	Are summer songs for me and my aunts,
2354	While we lie tumbling in the hay.
2355	
2356	I have served Prince Florizel and in my time
2357	wore three-pile; but now I am out of service:
2358	
2359	But shall I go mourn for that, my dear?
2360	The pale moon shines by night:
2361	And when I wander here and there,
2362	I then do most go right.
2363	
2364	If tinkers may have leave to live,
2365	And bear the sow-skin budget,
2366	Then my account I well may, give,
2367	And in the stocks avouch it.
2368	
2369	My traffic is sheets; when the kite builds, look to
2370	lesser linen. My father named me Autolycus; who
2371	being, as I am, littered under Mercury, was likewise
2372	a snapper-up of unconsidered trifles. With die and
2373	drab I purchased this caparison, and my revenue is
2374	the silly cheat. Gallows and knock are too powerful
2375	on the highway: beating and hanging are terrors to
2376	me: for the life to come, I sleep out the thought
2377	of it. A prize! a prize!
2378	
2379	[Enter Clown]
2380	
2381	Clown	Let me see: every 'leven wether tods; every tod
2382	yields pound and odd shilling; fifteen hundred
2383	shorn. what comes the wool to?
2384	
2385	AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]
2386	
2387	If the springe hold, the cock's mine.
2388	
2389	Clown	I cannot do't without counters. Let me see; what am
2390	I to buy for our sheep-shearing feast? Three pound
2391	of sugar, five pound of currants, rice,--what will
2392	this sister of mine do with rice? But my father
2393	hath made her mistress of the feast, and she lays it
2394	on. She hath made me four and twenty nose-gays for
2395	the shearers, three-man-song-men all, and very good
2396	ones; but they are most of them means and bases; but
2397	one puritan amongst them, and he sings psalms to
2398	horn-pipes. I must have saffron to colour the warden
2399	pies; mace; dates?--none, that's out of my note;
2400	nutmegs, seven; a race or two of ginger, but that I
2401	may beg; four pound of prunes, and as many of
2402	raisins o' the sun.
2403	
2404	AUTOLYCUS	O that ever I was born!
2405	
2406	[Grovelling on the ground]
2407	
2408	Clown	I' the name of me--
2409	
2410	AUTOLYCUS	O, help me, help me! pluck but off these rags; and
2411	then, death, death!
2412	
2413	Clown	Alack, poor soul! thou hast need of more rags to lay
2414	on thee, rather than have these off.
2415	
2416	AUTOLYCUS	O sir, the loathsomeness of them offends me more
2417	than the stripes I have received, which are mighty
2418	ones and millions.
2419	
2420	Clown	Alas, poor man! a million of beating may come to a
2421	great matter.
2422	
2423	AUTOLYCUS	I am robbed, sir, and beaten; my money and apparel
2424	ta'en from me, and these detestable things put upon
2425	me.
2426	
2427	Clown	What, by a horseman, or a footman?
2428	
2429	AUTOLYCUS	A footman, sweet sir, a footman.
2430	
2431	Clown	Indeed, he should be a footman by the garments he
2432	has left with thee: if this be a horseman's coat,
2433	it hath seen very hot service. Lend me thy hand,
2434	I'll help thee: come, lend me thy hand.
2435	
2436	AUTOLYCUS	O, good sir, tenderly, O!
2437	
2438	Clown	Alas, poor soul!
2439	
2440	AUTOLYCUS	O, good sir, softly, good sir! I fear, sir, my
2441	shoulder-blade is out.
2442	
2443	Clown	How now! canst stand?
2444	
2445	AUTOLYCUS	[Picking his pocket]
2446	
2447	Softly, dear sir; good sir, softly. You ha' done me
2448	a charitable office.
2449	
2450	Clown	Dost lack any money? I have a little money for thee.
2451	
2452	AUTOLYCUS	No, good sweet sir; no, I beseech you, sir: I have
2453	a kinsman not past three quarters of a mile hence,
2454	unto whom I was going; I shall there have money, or
2455	any thing I want: offer me no money, I pray you;
2456	that kills my heart.
2457	
2458	Clown	What manner of fellow was he that robbed you?
2459	
2460	AUTOLYCUS	A fellow, sir, that I have known to go about with
2461	troll-my-dames; I knew him once a servant of the
2462	prince: I cannot tell, good sir, for which of his
2463	virtues it was, but he was certainly whipped out of the court.
2464	
2465	Clown	His vices, you would say; there's no virtue whipped
2466	out of the court: they cherish it to make it stay
2467	there; and yet it will no more but abide.
2468	
2469	AUTOLYCUS	Vices, I would say, sir. I know this man well: he
2470	hath been since an ape-bearer; then a
2471	process-server, a bailiff; then he compassed a
2472	motion of the Prodigal Son, and married a tinker's
2473	wife within a mile where my land and living lies;
2474	and, having flown over many knavish professions, he
2475	settled only in rogue: some call him Autolycus.
2476	
2477	Clown	Out upon him! prig, for my life, prig: he haunts
2478	wakes, fairs and bear-baitings.
2479	
2480	AUTOLYCUS	Very true, sir; he, sir, he; that's the rogue that
2481	put me into this apparel.
2482	
2483	Clown	Not a more cowardly rogue in all Bohemia: if you had
2484	but looked big and spit at him, he'ld have run.
2485	
2486	AUTOLYCUS	I must confess to you, sir, I am no fighter: I am
2487	false of heart that way; and that he knew, I warrant
2488	him.
2489	
2490	Clown	How do you now?
2491	
2492	AUTOLYCUS	Sweet sir, much better than I was; I can stand and
2493	walk: I will even take my leave of you, and pace
2494	softly towards my kinsman's.
2495	
2496	Clown	Shall I bring thee on the way?
2497	
2498	AUTOLYCUS	No, good-faced sir; no, sweet sir.
2499	
2500	Clown	Then fare thee well: I must go buy spices for our
2501	sheep-shearing.
2502	
2503	AUTOLYCUS	Prosper you, sweet sir!
2504	
2505	[Exit Clown]
2506	
2507	Your purse is not hot enough to purchase your spice.
2508	I'll be with you at your sheep-shearing too: if I
2509	make not this cheat bring out another and the
2510	shearers prove sheep, let me be unrolled and my name
2511	put in the book of virtue!
2512	
2513	[Sings]
2514	
2515	Jog on, jog on, the foot-path way,
2516	And merrily hent the stile-a:
2517	A merry heart goes all the day,
2518	Your sad tires in a mile-a.

2532	SCENE IV	The Shepherd's cottage.
2533	
2534	
2535	[Enter FLORIZEL and PERDITA]
2536	
2537	FLORIZEL	These your unusual weeds to each part of you
2538	Do give a life: no shepherdess, but Flora
2539	Peering in April's front. This your sheep-shearing
2540	Is as a meeting of the petty gods,
2541	And you the queen on't.
2542	
2543	PERDITA	Sir, my gracious lord,
2544	To chide at your extremes it not becomes me:
2545	O, pardon, that I name them! Your high self,
2546	The gracious mark o' the land, you have obscured
2547	With a swain's wearing, and me, poor lowly maid,
2548	Most goddess-like prank'd up: but that our feasts
2549	In every mess have folly and the feeders
2550	Digest it with a custom, I should blush
2551	To see you so attired, sworn, I think,
2552	To show myself a glass.
2553	
2554	FLORIZEL	I bless the time
2555	When my good falcon made her flight across
2556	Thy father's ground.
2557	
2558	PERDITA	Now Jove afford you cause!
2559	To me the difference forges dread; your greatness
2560	Hath not been used to fear. Even now I tremble
2561	To think your father, by some accident,
2562	Should pass this way as you did: O, the Fates!
2563	How would he look, to see his work so noble
2564	Vilely bound up? What would he say? Or how
2565	Should I, in these my borrow'd flaunts, behold
2566	The sternness of his presence?
2567	
2568	FLORIZEL	Apprehend
2569	Nothing but jollity. The gods themselves,
2570	Humbling their deities to love, have taken
2571	The shapes of beasts upon them: Jupiter
2572	Became a bull, and bellow'd; the green Neptune
2573	A ram, and bleated; and the fire-robed god,
2574	Golden Apollo, a poor humble swain,
2575	As I seem now. Their transformations
2576	Were never for a piece of beauty rarer,
2577	Nor in a way so chaste, since my desires
2578	Run not before mine honour, nor my lusts
2579	Burn hotter than my faith.
2580	
2581	PERDITA	O, but, sir,
2582	Your resolution cannot hold, when 'tis
2583	Opposed, as it must be, by the power of the king:
2584	One of these two must be necessities,
2585	Which then will speak, that you must
2586	change this purpose,
2587	Or I my life.
2588	
2589	FLORIZEL	                  Thou dearest Perdita,
2590	With these forced thoughts, I prithee, darken not
2591	The mirth o' the feast. Or I'll be thine, my fair,
2592	Or not my father's. For I cannot be
2593	Mine own, nor any thing to any, if
2594	I be not thine. To this I am most constant,
2595	Though destiny say no. Be merry, gentle;
2596	Strangle such thoughts as these with any thing
2597	That you behold the while. Your guests are coming:
2598	Lift up your countenance, as it were the day
2599	Of celebration of that nuptial which
2600	We two have sworn shall come.
2601	
2602	PERDITA	O lady Fortune,
2603	Stand you auspicious!
2604	
2605	FLORIZEL	See, your guests approach:
2606	Address yourself to entertain them sprightly,
2607	And let's be red with mirth.

2612	Shepherd	Fie, daughter! when my old wife lived, upon
2613	This day she was both pantler, butler, cook,
2614	Both dame and servant; welcomed all, served all;
2615	Would sing her song and dance her turn; now here,
2616	At upper end o' the table, now i' the middle;
2617	On his shoulder, and his; her face o' fire
2618	With labour and the thing she took to quench it,
2619	She would to each one sip. You are retired,
2620	As if you were a feasted one and not
2621	The hostess of the meeting: pray you, bid
2622	These unknown friends to's welcome; for it is
2623	A way to make us better friends, more known.
2624	Come, quench your blushes and present yourself
2625	That which you are, mistress o' the feast: come on,
2626	And bid us welcome to your sheep-shearing,
2627	As your good flock shall prosper.
2628	
2629	PERDITA	[To POLIXENES]                  Sir, welcome:
2630	It is my father's will I should take on me
2631	The hostess-ship o' the day.
2632	
2633	[To CAMILLO]
2634	
2635	You're welcome, sir.
2636	Give me those flowers there, Dorcas. Reverend sirs,
2637	For you there's rosemary and rue; these keep
2638	Seeming and savour all the winter long:
2639	Grace and remembrance be to you both,
2640	And welcome to our shearing!
2641	
2642	POLIXENES	Shepherdess,
2643	A fair one are you--well you fit our ages
2644	With flowers of winter.
2645	
2646	PERDITA	Sir, the year growing ancient,
2647	Not yet on summer's death, nor on the birth
2648	Of trembling winter, the fairest
2649	flowers o' the season
2650	Are our carnations and streak'd gillyvors,
2651	Which some call nature's bastards: of that kind
2652	Our rustic garden's barren; and I care not
2653	To get slips of them.
2654	
2655	POLIXENES	Wherefore, gentle maiden,
2656	Do you neglect them?
2657	
2658	PERDITA	For I have heard it said
2659	There is an art which in their piedness shares
2660	With great creating nature.
2661	
2662	POLIXENES	Say there be;
2663	Yet nature is made better by no mean
2664	But nature makes that mean: so, over that art
2665	Which you say adds to nature, is an art
2666	That nature makes. You see, sweet maid, we marry
2667	A gentler scion to the wildest stock,
2668	And make conceive a bark of baser kind
2669	By bud of nobler race: this is an art
2670	Which does mend nature, change it rather, but
2671	The art itself is nature.
2672	
2673	PERDITA	So it is.
2674	
2675	POLIXENES	Then make your garden rich in gillyvors,
2676	And do not call them bastards.
2677	
2678	PERDITA	I'll not put
2679	The dibble in earth to set one slip of them;
2680	No more than were I painted I would wish
2681	This youth should say 'twere well and only therefore
2682	Desire to breed by me. Here's flowers for you;
2683	Hot lavender, mints, savoury, marjoram;
2684	The marigold, that goes to bed wi' the sun
2685	And with him rises weeping: these are flowers
2686	Of middle summer, and I think they are given
2687	To men of middle age. You're very welcome.
2688	
2689	CAMILLO	I should leave grazing, were I of your flock,
2690	And only live by gazing.
2691	
2692	PERDITA	Out, alas!
2693	You'd be so lean, that blasts of January
2694	Would blow you through and through.
2695	Now, my fair'st friend,
2696	I would I had some flowers o' the spring that might
2697	Become your time of day; and yours, and yours,
2698	That wear upon your virgin branches yet
2699	Your maidenheads growing: O Proserpina,
2700	For the flowers now, that frighted thou let'st fall
2701	From Dis's waggon! daffodils,
2702	That come before the swallow dares, and take
2703	The winds of March with beauty; violets dim,
2704	But sweeter than the lids of Juno's eyes
2705	Or Cytherea's breath; pale primroses
2706	That die unmarried, ere they can behold
2707	Bight Phoebus in his strength--a malady
2708	Most incident to maids; bold oxlips and
2709	The crown imperial; lilies of all kinds,
2710	The flower-de-luce being one! O, these I lack,
2711	To make you garlands of, and my sweet friend,
2712	To strew him o'er and o'er!
2713	
2714	FLORIZEL	What, like a corse?
2715	
2716	PERDITA	No, like a bank for love to lie and play on;
2717	Not like a corse; or if, not to be buried,
2718	But quick and in mine arms. Come, take your flowers:
2719	Methinks I play as I have seen them do
2720	In Whitsun pastorals: sure this robe of mine
2721	Does change my disposition.
2722	
2723	FLORIZEL	What you do
2724	Still betters what is done. When you speak, sweet.
2725	I'ld have you do it ever: when you sing,
2726	I'ld have you buy and sell so, so give alms,
2727	Pray so; and, for the ordering your affairs,
2728	To sing them too: when you do dance, I wish you
2729	A wave o' the sea, that you might ever do
2730	Nothing but that; move still, still so,
2731	And own no other function: each your doing,
2732	So singular in each particular,
2733	Crowns what you are doing in the present deed,
2734	That all your acts are queens.
2735	
2736	PERDITA	O Doricles,
2737	Your praises are too large: but that your youth,
2738	And the true blood which peepeth fairly through't,
2739	Do plainly give you out an unstain'd shepherd,
2740	With wisdom I might fear, my Doricles,
2741	You woo'd me the false way.
2742	
2743	FLORIZEL	I think you have
2744	As little skill to fear as I have purpose
2745	To put you to't. But come; our dance, I pray:
2746	Your hand, my Perdita: so turtles pair,
2747	That never mean to part.
2748	
2749	PERDITA	I'll swear for 'em.
2750	
2751	POLIXENES	This is the prettiest low-born lass that ever
2752	Ran on the green-sward: nothing she does or seems
2753	But smacks of something greater than herself,
2754	Too noble for this place.
2755	
2756	CAMILLO	He tells her something
2757	That makes her blood look out: good sooth, she is
2758	The queen of curds and cream.
2759	
2760	Clown	Come on, strike up!
2761	
2762	DORCAS	Mopsa must be your mistress: marry, garlic,
2763	To mend her kissing with!
2764	
2765	MOPSA	Now, in good time!
2766	
2767	Clown	Not a word, a word; we stand upon our manners.
2768	Come, strike up!
2769	
2770	[Music. Here a dance of Shepherds and
2771	Shepherdesses]
2772	
2773	POLIXENES	Pray, good shepherd, what fair swain is this
2774	Which dances with your daughter?
2775	
2776	Shepherd	They call him Doricles; and boasts himself
2777	To have a worthy feeding: but I have it
2778	Upon his own report and I believe it;
2779	He looks like sooth. He says he loves my daughter:
2780	I think so too; for never gazed the moon
2781	Upon the water as he'll stand and read
2782	As 'twere my daughter's eyes: and, to be plain.
2783	I think there is not half a kiss to choose
2784	Who loves another best.
2785	
2786	POLIXENES	She dances featly.
2787	
2788	Shepherd	So she does any thing; though I report it,
2789	That should be silent: if young Doricles
2790	Do light upon her, she shall bring him that
2791	Which he not dreams of.
2792	
2793	[Enter Servant]
2794	
2795	Servant	O master, if you did but hear the pedlar at the
2796	door, you would never dance again after a tabour and
2797	pipe; no, the bagpipe could not move you: he sings
2798	several tunes faster than you'll tell money; he
2799	utters them as he had eaten ballads and all men's
2800	ears grew to his tunes.
2801	
2802	Clown	He could never come better; he shall come in. I
2803	love a ballad but even too well, if it be doleful
2804	matter merrily set down, or a very pleasant thing
2805	indeed and sung lamentably.
2806	
2807	Servant	He hath songs for man or woman, of all sizes; no
2808	milliner can so fit his customers with gloves: he
2809	has the prettiest love-songs for maids; so without
2810	bawdry, which is strange; with such delicate
2811	burthens of dildos and fadings, 'jump her and thump
2812	her;' and where some stretch-mouthed rascal would,
2813	as it were, mean mischief and break a foul gap into
2814	the matter, he makes the maid to answer 'Whoop, do me
2815	no harm, good man;' puts him off, slights him, with
2816	'Whoop, do me no harm, good man.'
2817	
2818	POLIXENES	This is a brave fellow.
2819	
2820	Clown	Believe me, thou talkest of an admirable conceited
2821	fellow. Has he any unbraided wares?
2822	
2823	Servant	He hath ribbons of an the colours i' the rainbow;
2824	points more than all the lawyers in Bohemia can
2825	learnedly handle, though they come to him by the
2826	gross: inkles, caddisses, cambrics, lawns: why, he
2827	sings 'em over as they were gods or goddesses; you
2828	would think a smock were a she-angel, he so chants
2829	to the sleeve-hand and the work about the square on't.
2830	
2831	Clown	Prithee bring him in; and let him approach singing.
2832	
2833	PERDITA	Forewarn him that he use no scurrilous words in 's tunes.
2834	
2835	[Exit Servant]
2836	
2837	Clown	You have of these pedlars, that have more in them
2838	than you'ld think, sister.
2839	
2840	PERDITA	Ay, good brother, or go about to think.
2841	
2842	[Enter AUTOLYCUS, singing]
2843	
2844	AUTOLYCUS	     Lawn as white as driven snow;
2845	Cyprus black as e'er was crow;
2846	Gloves as sweet as damask roses;
2847	Masks for faces and for noses;
2848	Bugle bracelet, necklace amber,
2849	Perfume for a lady's chamber;
2850	Golden quoifs and stomachers,
2851	For my lads to give their dears:
2852	Pins and poking-sticks of steel,
2853	What maids lack from head to heel:
2854	Come buy of me, come; come buy, come buy;
2855	Buy lads, or else your lasses cry: Come buy.
2856	
2857	Clown	If I were not in love with Mopsa, thou shouldst take
2858	no money of me; but being enthralled as I am, it
2859	will also be the bondage of certain ribbons and gloves.
2860	
2861	MOPSA	I was promised them against the feast; but they come
2862	not too late now.
2863	
2864	DORCAS	He hath promised you more than that, or there be liars.
2865	
2866	MOPSA	He hath paid you all he promised you; may be, he has
2867	paid you more, which will shame you to give him again.
2868	
2869	Clown	Is there no manners left among maids? will they
2870	wear their plackets where they should bear their
2871	faces? Is there not milking-time, when you are
2872	going to bed, or kiln-hole, to whistle off these
2873	secrets, but you must be tittle-tattling before all
2874	our guests? 'tis well they are whispering: clamour
2875	your tongues, and not a word more.
2876	
2877	MOPSA	I have done. Come, you promised me a tawdry-lace
2878	and a pair of sweet gloves.
2879	
2880	Clown	Have I not told thee how I was cozened by the way
2881	and lost all my money?
2882	
2883	AUTOLYCUS	And indeed, sir, there are cozeners abroad;
2884	therefore it behoves men to be wary.
2885	
2886	Clown	Fear not thou, man, thou shalt lose nothing here.
2887	
2888	AUTOLYCUS	I hope so, sir; for I have about me many parcels of charge.
2889	
2890	Clown	What hast here? ballads?
2891	
2892	MOPSA	Pray now, buy some: I love a ballad in print o'
2893	life, for then we are sure they are true.
2894	
2895	AUTOLYCUS	Here's one to a very doleful tune, how a usurer's
2896	wife was brought to bed of twenty money-bags at a
2897	burthen and how she longed to eat adders' heads and
2898	toads carbonadoed.
2899	
2900	MOPSA	Is it true, think you?
2901	
2902	AUTOLYCUS	Very true, and but a month old.
2903	
2904	DORCAS	Bless me from marrying a usurer!
2905	
2906	AUTOLYCUS	Here's the midwife's name to't, one Mistress
2907	Tale-porter, and five or six honest wives that were
2908	present. Why should I carry lies abroad?
2909	
2910	MOPSA	Pray you now, buy it.
2911	
2912	Clown	Come on, lay it by: and let's first see moe
2913	ballads; we'll buy the other things anon.
2914	
2915	AUTOLYCUS	Here's another ballad of a fish, that appeared upon
2916	the coast on Wednesday the four-score of April,
2917	forty thousand fathom above water, and sung this
2918	ballad against the hard hearts of maids: it was
2919	thought she was a woman and was turned into a cold
2920	fish for she would not exchange flesh with one that
2921	loved her: the ballad is very pitiful and as true.
2922	
2923	DORCAS	Is it true too, think you?
2924	
2925	AUTOLYCUS	Five justices' hands at it, and witnesses more than
2926	my pack will hold.
2927	
2928	Clown	Lay it by too: another.
2929	
2930	AUTOLYCUS	This is a merry ballad, but a very pretty one.
2931	
2932	MOPSA	Let's have some merry ones.
2933	
2934	AUTOLYCUS	Why, this is a passing merry one and goes to
2935	the tune of 'Two maids wooing a man:' there's
2936	scarce a maid westward but she sings it; 'tis in
2937	request, I can tell you.
2938	
2939	MOPSA	We can both sing it: if thou'lt bear a part, thou
2940	shalt hear; 'tis in three parts.
2941	
2942	DORCAS	We had the tune on't a month ago.
2943	
2944	AUTOLYCUS	I can bear my part; you must know 'tis my
2945	occupation; have at it with you.
2946	[SONG]
2947	
2948	AUTOLYCUS	Get you hence, for I must go
2949	Where it fits not you to know.
2950	
2951	DORCAS	     Whither?
2952	
2953	MOPSA	                  O, whither?
2954	
2955	DORCAS	Whither?
2956	
2957	MOPSA	     It becomes thy oath full well,
2958	Thou to me thy secrets tell.
2959	
2960	DORCAS	          Me too, let me go thither.
2961	
2962	MOPSA	     Or thou goest to the orange or mill.
2963	
2964	DORCAS	     If to either, thou dost ill.
2965	
2966	AUTOLYCUS	Neither.
2967	
2968	DORCAS	       What, neither?
2969	
2970	AUTOLYCUS	Neither.
2971	
2972	DORCAS	     Thou hast sworn my love to be.
2973	
2974	MOPSA	     Thou hast sworn it more to me:
2975	Then whither goest? say, whither?
2976	
2977	Clown	We'll have this song out anon by ourselves: my
2978	father and the gentlemen are in sad talk, and we'll
2979	not trouble them. Come, bring away thy pack after
2980	me. Wenches, I'll buy for you both. Pedlar, let's
2981	have the first choice. Follow me, girls.
2982	
2983	[Exit with DORCAS and MOPSA]
2984	
2985	AUTOLYCUS	And you shall pay well for 'em.
2986	
2987	[Follows singing]
2988	
2989	Will you buy any tape,
2990	Or lace for your cape,
2991	My dainty duck, my dear-a?
2992	Any silk, any thread,
2993	Any toys for your head,
2994	Of the new'st and finest, finest wear-a?
2995	Come to the pedlar;
2996	Money's a medler.
2997	That doth utter all men's ware-a.
2998	
2999	[Exit]
3000	
3001	[Re-enter Servant]
3002	
3003	Servant	Master, there is three carters, three shepherds,
3004	three neat-herds, three swine-herds, that have made
3005	themselves all men of hair, they call themselves
3006	Saltiers, and they have a dance which the wenches
3007	say is a gallimaufry of gambols, because they are
3008	not in't; but they themselves are o' the mind, if it
3009	be not too rough for some that know little but
3010	bowling, it will please plentifully.
3011	
3012	Shepherd	Away! we'll none on 't: here has been too much
3013	homely foolery already. I know, sir, we weary you.
3014	
3015	POLIXENES	You weary those that refresh us: pray, let's see
3016	these four threes of herdsmen.
3017	
3018	Servant	One three of them, by their own report, sir, hath
3019	danced before the king; and not the worst of the
3020	three but jumps twelve foot and a half by the squier.
3021	
3022	Shepherd	Leave your prating: since these good men are
3023	pleased, let them come in; but quickly now.
3024	
3025	Servant	Why, they stay at door, sir.
3026	
3027	[Exit]
3028	
3029	[Here a dance of twelve Satyrs]
3030	
3031	POLIXENES	O, father, you'll know more of that hereafter.
3032	
3033	[To CAMILLO]
3034	
3035	Is it not too far gone? 'Tis time to part them.
3036	He's simple and tells much.
3037	
3038	[To FLORIZEL]
3039	
3040	How now, fair shepherd!
3041	Your heart is full of something that does take
3042	Your mind from feasting. Sooth, when I was young
3043	And handed love as you do, I was wont
3044	To load my she with knacks: I would have ransack'd
3045	The pedlar's silken treasury and have pour'd it
3046	To her acceptance; you have let him go
3047	And nothing marted with him. If your lass
3048	Interpretation should abuse and call this
3049	Your lack of love or bounty, you were straited
3050	For a reply, at least if you make a care
3051	Of happy holding her.
3052	
3053	FLORIZEL	Old sir, I know
3054	She prizes not such trifles as these are:
3055	The gifts she looks from me are pack'd and lock'd
3056	Up in my heart; which I have given already,
3057	But not deliver'd. O, hear me breathe my life
3058	Before this ancient sir, who, it should seem,
3059	Hath sometime loved! I take thy hand, this hand,
3060	As soft as dove's down and as white as it,
3061	Or Ethiopian's tooth, or the fann'd
3062	snow that's bolted
3063	By the northern blasts twice o'er.
3064	
3065	POLIXENES	What follows this?
3066	How prettily the young swain seems to wash
3067	The hand was fair before! I have put you out:
3068	But to your protestation; let me hear
3069	What you profess.
3070	
3071	FLORIZEL	                  Do, and be witness to 't.
3072	
3073	POLIXENES	And this my neighbour too?
3074	
3075	FLORIZEL	And he, and more
3076	Than he, and men, the earth, the heavens, and all:
3077	That, were I crown'd the most imperial monarch,
3078	Thereof most worthy, were I the fairest youth
3079	That ever made eye swerve, had force and knowledge
3080	More than was ever man's, I would not prize them
3081	Without her love; for her employ them all;
3082	Commend them and condemn them to her service
3083	Or to their own perdition.
3084	
3085	POLIXENES	Fairly offer'd.
3086	
3087	CAMILLO	This shows a sound affection.
3088	
3089	Shepherd	But, my daughter,
3090	Say you the like to him?
3091	
3092	PERDITA	I cannot speak
3093	So well, nothing so well; no, nor mean better:
3094	By the pattern of mine own thoughts I cut out
3095	The purity of his.
3096	
3097	Shepherd	                  Take hands, a bargain!
3098	And, friends unknown, you shall bear witness to 't:
3099	I give my daughter to him, and will make
3100	Her portion equal his.
3101	
3102	FLORIZEL	O, that must be
3103	I' the virtue of your daughter: one being dead,
3104	I shall have more than you can dream of yet;
3105	Enough then for your wonder. But, come on,
3106	Contract us 'fore these witnesses.
3107	
3108	Shepherd	Come, your hand;
3109	And, daughter, yours.
3110	
3111	POLIXENES	Soft, swain, awhile, beseech you;
3112	Have you a father?
3113	
3114	FLORIZEL	                  I have: but what of him?
3115	
3116	POLIXENES	Knows he of this?
3117	
3118	FLORIZEL	                  He neither does nor shall.
3119	
3120	POLIXENES	Methinks a father
3121	Is at the nuptial of his son a guest
3122	That best becomes the table. Pray you once more,
3123	Is not your father grown incapable
3124	Of reasonable affairs? is he not stupid
3125	With age and altering rheums? can he speak? hear?
3126	Know man from man? dispute his own estate?
3127	Lies he not bed-rid? and again does nothing
3128	But what he did being childish?
3129	
3130	FLORIZEL	No, good sir;
3131	He has his health and ampler strength indeed
3132	Than most have of his age.
3133	
3134	POLIXENES	By my white beard,
3135	You offer him, if this be so, a wrong
3136	Something unfilial: reason my son
3137	Should choose himself a wife, but as good reason
3138	The father, all whose joy is nothing else
3139	But fair posterity, should hold some counsel
3140	In such a business.
3141	
3142	FLORIZEL	I yield all this;
3143	But for some other reasons, my grave sir,
3144	Which 'tis not fit you know, I not acquaint
3145	My father of this business.
3146	
3147	POLIXENES	Let him know't.
3148	
3149	FLORIZEL	He shall not.
3150	
3151	POLIXENES	                  Prithee, let him.
3152	
3153	FLORIZEL	No, he must not.
3154	
3155	Shepherd	Let him, my son: he shall not need to grieve
3156	At knowing of thy choice.
3157	
3158	FLORIZEL	Come, come, he must not.
3159	Mark our contract.
3160	
3161	POLIXENES	                  Mark your divorce, young sir,
3162	
3163	[Discovering himself]
3164	
3165	Whom son I dare not call; thou art too base
3166	To be acknowledged: thou a sceptre's heir,
3167	That thus affect'st a sheep-hook! Thou old traitor,
3168	I am sorry that by hanging thee I can
3169	But shorten thy life one week. And thou, fresh piece
3170	Of excellent witchcraft, who of force must know
3171	The royal fool thou copest with,--
3172	
3173	Shepherd	O, my heart!
3174	
3175	POLIXENES	I'll have thy beauty scratch'd with briers, and made
3176	More homely than thy state. For thee, fond boy,
3177	If I may ever know thou dost but sigh
3178	That thou no more shalt see this knack, as never
3179	I mean thou shalt, we'll bar thee from succession;
3180	Not hold thee of our blood, no, not our kin,
3181	Far than Deucalion off: mark thou my words:
3182	Follow us to the court. Thou churl, for this time,
3183	Though full of our displeasure, yet we free thee
3184	From the dead blow of it. And you, enchantment.--
3185	Worthy enough a herdsman: yea, him too,
3186	That makes himself, but for our honour therein,
3187	Unworthy thee,--if ever henceforth thou
3188	These rural latches to his entrance open,
3189	Or hoop his body more with thy embraces,
3190	I will devise a death as cruel for thee
3191	As thou art tender to't.
3192	
3193	[Exit]
3194	
3195	PERDITA	Even here undone!
3196	I was not much afeard; for once or twice
3197	I was about to speak and tell him plainly,
3198	The selfsame sun that shines upon his court
3199	Hides not his visage from our cottage but
3200	Looks on alike. Will't please you, sir, be gone?
3201	I told you what would come of this: beseech you,
3202	Of your own state take care: this dream of mine,--
3203	Being now awake, I'll queen it no inch farther,
3204	But milk my ewes and weep.
3205	
3206	CAMILLO	Why, how now, father!
3207	Speak ere thou diest.
3208	
3209	Shepherd	I cannot speak, nor think
3210	Nor dare to know that which I know. O sir!
3211	You have undone a man of fourscore three,
3212	That thought to fill his grave in quiet, yea,
3213	To die upon the bed my father died,
3214	To lie close by his honest bones: but now
3215	Some hangman must put on my shroud and lay me
3216	Where no priest shovels in dust. O cursed wretch,
3217	That knew'st this was the prince,
3218	and wouldst adventure
3219	To mingle faith with him! Undone! undone!
3220	If I might die within this hour, I have lived
3221	To die when I desire.
3222	
3223	[Exit]
3224	
3225	FLORIZEL	Why look you so upon me?
3226	I am but sorry, not afeard; delay'd,
3227	But nothing alter'd: what I was, I am;
3228	More straining on for plucking back, not following
3229	My leash unwillingly.
3230	
3231	CAMILLO	Gracious my lord,
3232	You know your father's temper: at this time
3233	He will allow no speech, which I do guess
3234	You do not purpose to him; and as hardly
3235	Will he endure your sight as yet, I fear:
3236	Then, till the fury of his highness settle,
3237	Come not before him.
3238	
3239	FLORIZEL	I not purpose it.
3240	I think, Camillo?
3241	
3242	CAMILLO	                  Even he, my lord.
3243	
3244	PERDITA	How often have I told you 'twould be thus!
3245	How often said, my dignity would last
3246	But till 'twere known!
3247	
3248	FLORIZEL	It cannot fail but by
3249	The violation of my faith; and then
3250	Let nature crush the sides o' the earth together
3251	And mar the seeds within! Lift up thy looks:
3252	From my succession wipe me, father; I
3253	Am heir to my affection.
3254	
3255	CAMILLO	Be advised.
3256	
3257	FLORIZEL	I am, and by my fancy: if my reason
3258	Will thereto be obedient, I have reason;
3259	If not, my senses, better pleased with madness,
3260	Do bid it welcome.
3261	
3262	CAMILLO	                  This is desperate, sir.
3263	
3264	FLORIZEL	So call it: but it does fulfil my vow;
3265	I needs must think it honesty. Camillo,
3266	Not for Bohemia, nor the pomp that may
3267	Be thereat glean'd, for all the sun sees or
3268	The close earth wombs or the profound sea hides
3269	In unknown fathoms, will I break my oath
3270	To this my fair beloved: therefore, I pray you,
3271	As you have ever been my father's honour'd friend,
3272	When he shall miss me,--as, in faith, I mean not
3273	To see him any more,--cast your good counsels
3274	Upon his passion; let myself and fortune
3275	Tug for the time to come. This you may know
3276	And so deliver, I am put to sea
3277	With her whom here I cannot hold on shore;
3278	And most opportune to our need I have
3279	A vessel rides fast by, but not prepared
3280	For this design. What course I mean to hold
3281	Shall nothing benefit your knowledge, nor
3282	Concern me the reporting.
3283	
3284	CAMILLO	O my lord!
3285	I would your spirit were easier for advice,
3286	Or stronger for your need.
3287	
3288	FLORIZEL	Hark, Perdita
3289	
3290	[Drawing her aside]
3291	
3292	I'll hear you by and by.
3293	
3294	CAMILLO	He's irremoveable,
3295	Resolved for flight. Now were I happy, if
3296	His going I could frame to serve my turn,
3297	Save him from danger, do him love and honour,
3298	Purchase the sight again of dear Sicilia
3299	And that unhappy king, my master, whom
3300	I so much thirst to see.
3301	
3302	FLORIZEL	Now, good Camillo;
3303	I am so fraught with curious business that
3304	I leave out ceremony.
3305	
3306	CAMILLO	Sir, I think
3307	You have heard of my poor services, i' the love
3308	That I have borne your father?
3309	
3310	FLORIZEL	Very nobly
3311	Have you deserved: it is my father's music
3312	To speak your deeds, not little of his care
3313	To have them recompensed as thought on.
3314	
3315	CAMILLO	Well, my lord,
3316	If you may please to think I love the king
3317	And through him what is nearest to him, which is
3318	Your gracious self, embrace but my direction:
3319	If your more ponderous and settled project
3320	May suffer alteration, on mine honour,
3321	I'll point you where you shall have such receiving
3322	As shall become your highness; where you may
3323	Enjoy your mistress, from the whom, I see,
3324	There's no disjunction to be made, but by--
3325	As heavens forefend!--your ruin; marry her,
3326	And, with my best endeavours in your absence,
3327	Your discontenting father strive to qualify
3328	And bring him up to liking.
3329	
3330	FLORIZEL	How, Camillo,
3331	May this, almost a miracle, be done?
3332	That I may call thee something more than man
3333	And after that trust to thee.
3334	
3335	CAMILLO	Have you thought on
3336	A place whereto you'll go?
3337	
3338	FLORIZEL	Not any yet:
3339	But as the unthought-on accident is guilty
3340	To what we wildly do, so we profess
3341	Ourselves to be the slaves of chance and flies
3342	Of every wind that blows.
3343	
3344	CAMILLO	Then list to me:
3345	This follows, if you will not change your purpose
3346	But undergo this flight, make for Sicilia,
3347	And there present yourself and your fair princess,
3348	For so I see she must be, 'fore Leontes:
3349	She shall be habited as it becomes
3350	The partner of your bed. Methinks I see
3351	Leontes opening his free arms and weeping
3352	His welcomes forth; asks thee the son forgiveness,
3353	As 'twere i' the father's person; kisses the hands
3354	Of your fresh princess; o'er and o'er divides him
3355	'Twixt his unkindness and his kindness; the one
3356	He chides to hell and bids the other grow
3357	Faster than thought or time.
3358	
3359	FLORIZEL	Worthy Camillo,
3360	What colour for my visitation shall I
3361	Hold up before him?
3362	
3363	CAMILLO	Sent by the king your father
3364	To greet him and to give him comforts. Sir,
3365	The manner of your bearing towards him, with
3366	What you as from your father shall deliver,
3367	Things known betwixt us three, I'll write you down:
3368	The which shall point you forth at every sitting
3369	What you must say; that he shall not perceive
3370	But that you have your father's bosom there
3371	And speak his very heart.
3372	
3373	FLORIZEL	I am bound to you:
3374	There is some sap in this.
3375	
3376	CAMILLO	A cause more promising
3377	Than a wild dedication of yourselves
3378	To unpath'd waters, undream'd shores, most certain
3379	To miseries enough; no hope to help you,
3380	But as you shake off one to take another;
3381	Nothing so certain as your anchors, who
3382	Do their best office, if they can but stay you
3383	Where you'll be loath to be: besides you know
3384	Prosperity's the very bond of love,
3385	Whose fresh complexion and whose heart together
3386	Affliction alters.
3387	
3388	PERDITA	                  One of these is true:
3389	I think affliction may subdue the cheek,
3390	But not take in the mind.
3391	
3392	CAMILLO	Yea, say you so?
3393	There shall not at your father's house these
3394	seven years
3395	Be born another such.
3396	
3397	FLORIZEL	My good Camillo,
3398	She is as forward of her breeding as
3399	She is i' the rear our birth.
3400	
3401	CAMILLO	I cannot say 'tis pity
3402	She lacks instructions, for she seems a mistress
3403	To most that teach.
3404	
3405	PERDITA	Your pardon, sir; for this
3406	I'll blush you thanks.
3407	
3408	FLORIZEL	My prettiest Perdita!
3409	But O, the thorns we stand upon! Camillo,
3410	Preserver of my father, now of me,
3411	The medicine of our house, how shall we do?
3412	We are not furnish'd like Bohemia's son,
3413	Nor shall appear in Sicilia.
3414	
3415	CAMILLO	My lord,
3416	Fear none of this: I think you know my fortunes
3417	Do all lie there: it shall be so my care
3418	To have you royally appointed as if
3419	The scene you play were mine. For instance, sir,
3420	That you may know you shall not want, one word.
3421	
3422	[They talk aside]
3423	
3424	[Re-enter AUTOLYCUS]
3425	
3426	AUTOLYCUS	Ha, ha! what a fool Honesty is! and Trust, his
3427	sworn brother, a very simple gentleman! I have sold
3428	all my trumpery; not a counterfeit stone, not a
3429	ribbon, glass, pomander, brooch, table-book, ballad,
3430	knife, tape, glove, shoe-tie, bracelet, horn-ring,
3431	to keep my pack from fasting: they throng who
3432	should buy first, as if my trinkets had been
3433	hallowed and brought a benediction to the buyer:
3434	by which means I saw whose purse was best in
3435	picture; and what I saw, to my good use I
3436	remembered. My clown, who wants but something to
3437	be a reasonable man, grew so in love with the
3438	wenches' song, that he would not stir his pettitoes
3439	till he had both tune and words; which so drew the
3440	rest of the herd to me that all their other senses
3441	stuck in ears: you might have pinched a placket, it
3442	was senseless; 'twas nothing to geld a codpiece of a
3443	purse; I could have filed keys off that hung in
3444	chains: no hearing, no feeling, but my sir's song,
3445	and admiring the nothing of it. So that in this
3446	time of lethargy I picked and cut most of their
3447	festival purses; and had not the old man come in
3448	with a whoo-bub against his daughter and the king's
3449	son and scared my choughs from the chaff, I had not
3450	left a purse alive in the whole army.
3451	
3452	[CAMILLO, FLORIZEL, and PERDITA come forward]
3453	
3454	CAMILLO	Nay, but my letters, by this means being there
3455	So soon as you arrive, shall clear that doubt.
3456	
3457	FLORIZEL	And those that you'll procure from King Leontes--
3458	
3459	CAMILLO	Shall satisfy your father.
3460	
3461	PERDITA	Happy be you!
3462	All that you speak shows fair.
3463	
3464	CAMILLO	Who have we here?
3465	
3466	[Seeing AUTOLYCUS]
3467	
3468	We'll make an instrument of this, omit
3469	Nothing may give us aid.
3470	
3471	AUTOLYCUS	If they have overheard me now, why, hanging.
3472	
3473	CAMILLO	How now, good fellow! why shakest thou so? Fear
3474	not, man; here's no harm intended to thee.
3475	
3476	AUTOLYCUS	I am a poor fellow, sir.
3477	
3478	CAMILLO	Why, be so still; here's nobody will steal that from
3479	thee: yet for the outside of thy poverty we must
3480	make an exchange; therefore discase thee instantly,
3481	--thou must think there's a necessity in't,--and
3482	change garments with this gentleman: though the
3483	pennyworth on his side be the worst, yet hold thee,
3484	there's some boot.
3485	
3486	AUTOLYCUS	I am a poor fellow, sir.
3487	
3488	[Aside]
3489	
3490	I know ye well enough.
3491	
3492	CAMILLO	Nay, prithee, dispatch: the gentleman is half
3493	flayed already.
3494	
3495	AUTOLYCUS	Are you in earnest, sir?
3496	
3497	[Aside]
3498	
3499	I smell the trick on't.
3500	
3501	FLORIZEL	Dispatch, I prithee.
3502	
3503	AUTOLYCUS	Indeed, I have had earnest: but I cannot with
3504	conscience take it.
3505	
3506	CAMILLO	Unbuckle, unbuckle.
3507	
3508	[FLORIZEL and AUTOLYCUS exchange garments]
3509	
3510	Fortunate mistress,--let my prophecy
3511	Come home to ye!--you must retire yourself
3512	Into some covert: take your sweetheart's hat
3513	And pluck it o'er your brows, muffle your face,
3514	Dismantle you, and, as you can, disliken
3515	The truth of your own seeming; that you may--
3516	For I do fear eyes over--to shipboard
3517	Get undescried.
3518	
3519	PERDITA	                  I see the play so lies
3520	That I must bear a part.
3521	
3522	CAMILLO	No remedy.
3523	Have you done there?
3524	
3525	FLORIZEL	Should I now meet my father,
3526	He would not call me son.
3527	
3528	CAMILLO	Nay, you shall have no hat.
3529	
3530	[Giving it to PERDITA]
3531	
3532	Come, lady, come. Farewell, my friend.
3533	
3534	AUTOLYCUS	Adieu, sir.
3535	
3536	FLORIZEL	O Perdita, what have we twain forgot!
3537	Pray you, a word.
3538	
3539	CAMILLO	[Aside]  What I do next, shall be to tell the king
3540	Of this escape and whither they are bound;
3541	Wherein my hope is I shall so prevail
3542	To force him after: in whose company
3543	I shall review Sicilia, for whose sight
3544	I have a woman's longing.
3545	
3546	FLORIZEL	Fortune speed us!
3547	Thus we set on, Camillo, to the sea-side.
3548	
3549	CAMILLO	The swifter speed the better.
3550	
3551	[Exeunt FLORIZEL, PERDITA, and CAMILLO]
3552	
3553	AUTOLYCUS	I understand the business, I hear it: to have an
3554	open ear, a quick eye, and a nimble hand, is
3555	necessary for a cut-purse; a good nose is requisite
3556	also, to smell out work for the other senses. I see
3557	this is the time that the unjust man doth thrive.
3558	What an exchange had this been without boot! What
3559	a boot is here with this exchange! Sure the gods do
3560	this year connive at us, and we may do any thing
3561	extempore. The prince himself is about a piece of
3562	iniquity, stealing away from his father with his
3563	clog at his heels: if I thought it were a piece of
3564	honesty to acquaint the king withal, I would not
3565	do't: I hold it the more knavery to conceal it;
3566	and therein am I constant to my profession.
3567	
3568	[Re-enter Clown and Shepherd]
3569	
3570	Aside, aside; here is more matter for a hot brain:
3571	every lane's end, every shop, church, session,
3572	hanging, yields a careful man work.
3573	
3574	Clown	See, see; what a man you are now!
3575	There is no other way but to tell the king
3576	she's a changeling and none of your flesh and blood.
3577	
3578	Shepherd	Nay, but hear me.
3579	
3580	Clown	Nay, but hear me.
3581	
3582	Shepherd	Go to, then.
3583	
3584	Clown	She being none of your flesh and blood, your flesh
3585	and blood has not offended the king; and so your
3586	flesh and blood is not to be punished by him. Show
3587	those things you found about her, those secret
3588	things, all but what she has with her: this being
3589	done, let the law go whistle: I warrant you.
3590	
3591	Shepherd	I will tell the king all, every word, yea, and his
3592	son's pranks too; who, I may say, is no honest man,
3593	neither to his father nor to me, to go about to make
3594	me the king's brother-in-law.
3595	
3596	Clown	Indeed, brother-in-law was the farthest off you
3597	could have been to him and then your blood had been
3598	the dearer by I know how much an ounce.
3599	
3600	AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]  Very wisely, puppies!
3601	
3602	Shepherd	Well, let us to the king: there is that in this
3603	fardel will make him scratch his beard.
3604	
3605	AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]  I know not what impediment this complaint
3606	may be to the flight of my master.
3607	
3608	Clown	Pray heartily he be at palace.
3609	
3610	AUTOLYCUS	[Aside]  Though I am not naturally honest, I am so
3611	sometimes by chance: let me pocket up my pedlar's excrement.
3612	
3613	[Takes off his false beard]
3614	
3615	How now, rustics! whither are you bound?
3616	
3617	Shepherd	To the palace, an it like your worship.
3618	
3619	AUTOLYCUS	Your affairs there, what, with whom, the condition
3620	of that fardel, the place of your dwelling, your
3621	names, your ages, of what having, breeding, and any
3622	thing that is fitting to be known, discover.
3623	
3624	Clown	We are but plain fellows, sir.
3625	
3626	AUTOLYCUS	A lie; you are rough and hairy. Let me have no
3627	lying: it becomes none but tradesmen, and they
3628	often give us soldiers the lie: but we pay them for
3629	it with stamped coin, not stabbing steel; therefore
3630	they do not give us the lie.
3631	
3632	Clown	Your worship had like to have given us one, if you
3633	had not taken yourself with the manner.
3634	
3635	Shepherd	Are you a courtier, an't like you, sir?
3636	
3637	AUTOLYCUS	Whether it like me or no, I am a courtier. Seest
3638	thou not the air of the court in these enfoldings?
3639	hath not my gait in it the measure of the court?
3640	receives not thy nose court-odor from me? reflect I
3641	not on thy baseness court-contempt? Thinkest thou,
3642	for that I insinuate, or toaze from thee thy
3643	business, I am therefore no courtier? I am courtier
3644	cap-a-pe; and one that will either push on or pluck
3645	back thy business there: whereupon I command thee to
3646	open thy affair.
3647	
3648	Shepherd	My business, sir, is to the king.
3649	
3650	AUTOLYCUS	What advocate hast thou to him?
3651	
3652	Shepherd	I know not, an't like you.
3653	
3654	Clown	Advocate's the court-word for a pheasant: say you
3655	have none.
3656	
3657	Shepherd	None, sir; I have no pheasant, cock nor hen.
3658	
3659	AUTOLYCUS	How blessed are we that are not simple men!
3660	Yet nature might have made me as these are,
3661	Therefore I will not disdain.
3662	
3663	Clown	This cannot be but a great courtier.
3664	
3665	Shepherd	His garments are rich, but he wears
3666	them not handsomely.
3667	
3668	Clown	He seems to be the more noble in being fantastical:
3669	a great man, I'll warrant; I know by the picking
3670	on's teeth.
3671	
3672	AUTOLYCUS	The fardel there? what's i' the fardel?
3673	Wherefore that box?
3674	
3675	Shepherd	Sir, there lies such secrets in this fardel and box,
3676	which none must know but the king; and which he
3677	shall know within this hour, if I may come to the
3678	speech of him.
3679	
3680	AUTOLYCUS	Age, thou hast lost thy labour.
3681	
3682	Shepherd	Why, sir?
3683	
3684	AUTOLYCUS	The king is not at the palace; he is gone aboard a
3685	new ship to purge melancholy and air himself: for,
3686	if thou beest capable of things serious, thou must
3687	know the king is full of grief.
3688	
3689	Shepard	So 'tis said, sir; about his son, that should have
3690	married a shepherd's daughter.
3691	
3692	AUTOLYCUS	If that shepherd be not in hand-fast, let him fly:
3693	the curses he shall have, the tortures he shall
3694	feel, will break the back of man, the heart of monster.
3695	
3696	Clown	Think you so, sir?
3697	
3698	AUTOLYCUS	Not he alone shall suffer what wit can make heavy
3699	and vengeance bitter; but those that are germane to
3700	him, though removed fifty times, shall all come
3701	under the hangman: which though it be great pity,
3702	yet it is necessary. An old sheep-whistling rogue a
3703	ram-tender, to offer to have his daughter come into
3704	grace! Some say he shall be stoned; but that death
3705	is too soft for him, say I	draw our throne into a
3706	sheep-cote! all deaths are too few, the sharpest too easy.
3707	
3708	Clown	Has the old man e'er a son, sir, do you hear. an't
3709	like you, sir?
3710	
3711	AUTOLYCUS	He has a son, who shall be flayed alive; then
3712	'nointed over with honey, set on the head of a
3713	wasp's nest; then stand till he be three quarters
3714	and a dram dead; then recovered again with
3715	aqua-vitae or some other hot infusion; then, raw as
3716	he is, and in the hottest day prognostication
3717	proclaims, shall be be set against a brick-wall, the
3718	sun looking with a southward eye upon him, where he
3719	is to behold him with flies blown to death. But what
3720	talk we of these traitorly rascals, whose miseries
3721	are to be smiled at, their offences being so
3722	capital? Tell me, for you seem to be honest plain
3723	men, what you have to the king: being something
3724	gently considered, I'll bring you where he is
3725	aboard, tender your persons to his presence,
3726	whisper him in your behalfs; and if it be in man
3727	besides the king to effect your suits, here is man
3728	shall do it.
3729	
3730	Clown	He seems to be of great authority: close with him,
3731	give him gold; and though authority be a stubborn
3732	bear, yet he is oft led by the nose with gold: show
3733	the inside of your purse to the outside of his hand,
3734	and no more ado. Remember 'stoned,' and 'flayed alive.'
3735	
3736	Shepherd	An't please you, sir, to undertake the business for
3737	us, here is that gold I have: I'll make it as much
3738	more and leave this young man in pawn till I bring it you.
3739	
3740	AUTOLYCUS	After I have done what I promised?
3741	
3742	Shepherd	Ay, sir.
3743	
3744	AUTOLYCUS	Well, give me the moiety. Are you a party in this business?
3745	
3746	Clown	In some sort, sir: but though my case be a pitiful
3747	one, I hope I shall not be flayed out of it.
3748	
3749	AUTOLYCUS	O, that's the case of the shepherd's son: hang him,
3750	he'll be made an example.
3751	
3752	Clown	Comfort, good comfort! We must to the king and show
3753	our strange sights: he must know 'tis none of your
3754	daughter nor my sister; we are gone else. Sir, I
3755	will give you as much as this old man does when the
3756	business is performed, and remain, as he says, your
3757	pawn till it be brought you.
3758	
3759	AUTOLYCUS	I will trust you. Walk before toward the sea-side;
3760	go on the right hand: I will but look upon the
3761	hedge and follow you.
3762	
3763	Clown	We are blest in this man, as I may say, even blest.
3764	
3765	Shepherd	Let's before as he bids us: he was provided to do us good.
3766	
3767	[Exeunt Shepherd and Clown]
3768	
3769	AUTOLYCUS	If I had a mind to be honest, I see Fortune would
3770	not suffer me: she drops booties in my mouth. I am
3771	courted now with a double occasion, gold and a means
3772	to do the prince my master good; which who knows how
3773	that may turn back to my advancement? I will bring
3774	these two moles, these blind ones, aboard him: if he
3775	think it fit to shore them again and that the
3776	complaint they have to the king concerns him
3777	nothing, let him call me rogue for being so far
3778	officious; for I am proof against that title and
3779	what shame else belongs to't. To him will I present
3780	them: there may be matter in it.
3781	
3782	[Exit]

3786	
3787	THE WINTER'S TALE
3788	
3789	
3790	ACT V
3791	
3792	
3793	
3794	SCENE I	A room in LEONTES' palace.
3795	
3796	
3797	[Enter LEONTES, CLEOMENES, DION, PAULINA, and Servants]
3798	
3799	CLEOMENES	Sir, you have done enough, and have perform'd
3800	A saint-like sorrow: no fault could you make,
3801	Which you have not redeem'd; indeed, paid down
3802	More penitence than done trespass: at the last,
3803	Do as the heavens have done, forget your evil;
3804	With them forgive yourself.
3805	
3806	LEONTES	Whilst I remember
3807	Her and her virtues, I cannot forget
3808	My blemishes in them, and so still think of
3809	The wrong I did myself; which was so much,
3810	That heirless it hath made my kingdom and
3811	Destroy'd the sweet'st companion that e'er man
3812	Bred his hopes out of.
3813	
3814	PAULINA	True, too true, my lord:
3815	If, one by one, you wedded all the world,
3816	Or from the all that are took something good,
3817	To make a perfect woman, she you kill'd
3818	Would be unparallel'd.
3819	
3820	LEONTES	I think so. Kill'd!
3821	She I kill'd! I did so: but thou strikest me
3822	Sorely, to say I did; it is as bitter
3823	Upon thy tongue as in my thought: now, good now,
3824	Say so but seldom.
3825	
3826	CLEOMENES	                  Not at all, good lady:
3827	You might have spoken a thousand things that would
3828	Have done the time more benefit and graced
3829	Your kindness better.
3830	
3831	PAULINA	You are one of those
3832	Would have him wed again.
3833	
3834	DION	If you would not so,
3835	You pity not the state, nor the remembrance
3836	Of his most sovereign name; consider little
3837	What dangers, by his highness' fail of issue,
3838	May drop upon his kingdom and devour
3839	Incertain lookers on. What were more holy
3840	Than to rejoice the former queen is well?
3841	What holier than, for royalty's repair,
3842	For present comfort and for future good,
3843	To bless the bed of majesty again
3844	With a sweet fellow to't?
3845	
3846	PAULINA	There is none worthy,
3847	Respecting her that's gone. Besides, the gods
3848	Will have fulfill'd their secret purposes;
3849	For has not the divine Apollo said,
3850	Is't not the tenor of his oracle,
3851	That King Leontes shall not have an heir
3852	Till his lost child be found? which that it shall,
3853	Is all as monstrous to our human reason
3854	As my Antigonus to break his grave
3855	And come again to me; who, on my life,
3856	Did perish with the infant. 'Tis your counsel
3857	My lord should to the heavens be contrary,
3858	Oppose against their wills.
3859	
3860	[To LEONTES]
3861	
3862	Care not for issue;
3863	The crown will find an heir: great Alexander
3864	Left his to the worthiest; so his successor
3865	Was like to be the best.
3866	
3867	LEONTES	Good Paulina,
3868	Who hast the memory of Hermione,
3869	I know, in honour, O, that ever I
3870	Had squared me to thy counsel! then, even now,
3871	I might have look'd upon my queen's full eyes,
3872	Have taken treasure from her lips--
3873	
3874	PAULINA	And left them
3875	More rich for what they yielded.
3876	
3877	LEONTES	Thou speak'st truth.
3878	No more such wives; therefore, no wife: one worse,
3879	And better used, would make her sainted spirit
3880	Again possess her corpse, and on this stage,
3881	Where we're offenders now, appear soul-vex'd,
3882	And begin, 'Why to me?'
3883	
3884	PAULINA	Had she such power,
3885	She had just cause.
3886	
3887	LEONTES	She had; and would incense me
3888	To murder her I married.
3889	
3890	PAULINA	I should so.
3891	Were I the ghost that walk'd, I'ld bid you mark
3892	Her eye, and tell me for what dull part in't
3893	You chose her; then I'ld shriek, that even your ears
3894	Should rift to hear me; and the words that follow'd
3895	Should be 'Remember mine.'
3896	
3897	LEONTES	Stars, stars,
3898	And all eyes else dead coals! Fear thou no wife;
3899	I'll have no wife, Paulina.
3900	
3901	PAULINA	Will you swear
3902	Never to marry but by my free leave?
3903	
3904	LEONTES	Never, Paulina; so be blest my spirit!
3905	
3906	PAULINA	Then, good my lords, bear witness to his oath.
3907	
3908	CLEOMENES	You tempt him over-much.
3909	
3910	PAULINA	Unless another,
3911	As like Hermione as is her picture,
3912	Affront his eye.
3913	
3914	CLEOMENES	                  Good madam,--
3915	
3916	PAULINA	I have done.
3917	Yet, if my lord will marry,--if you will, sir,
3918	No remedy, but you will,--give me the office
3919	To choose you a queen: she shall not be so young
3920	As was your former; but she shall be such
3921	As, walk'd your first queen's ghost,
3922	it should take joy
3923	To see her in your arms.
3924	
3925	LEONTES	My true Paulina,
3926	We shall not marry till thou bid'st us.
3927	
3928	PAULINA	That
3929	Shall be when your first queen's again in breath;
3930	Never till then.
3931	
3932	[Enter a Gentleman]
3933	
3934	Gentleman	One that gives out himself Prince Florizel,
3935	Son of Polixenes, with his princess, she
3936	The fairest I have yet beheld, desires access
3937	To your high presence.
3938	
3939	LEONTES	What with him? he comes not
3940	Like to his father's greatness: his approach,
3941	So out of circumstance and sudden, tells us
3942	'Tis not a visitation framed, but forced
3943	By need and accident. What train?
3944	
3945	Gentleman	But few,
3946	And those but mean.
3947	
3948	LEONTES	His princess, say you, with him?
3949	
3950	Gentleman	Ay, the most peerless piece of earth, I think,
3951	That e'er the sun shone bright on.
3952	
3953	PAULINA	O Hermione,
3954	As every present time doth boast itself
3955	Above a better gone, so must thy grave
3956	Give way to what's seen now! Sir, you yourself
3957	Have said and writ so, but your writing now
3958	Is colder than that theme, 'She had not been,
3959	Nor was not to be equall'd;'--thus your verse
3960	Flow'd with her beauty once: 'tis shrewdly ebb'd,
3961	To say you have seen a better.
3962	
3963	Gentleman	Pardon, madam:
3964	The one I have almost forgot,--your pardon,--
3965	The other, when she has obtain'd your eye,
3966	Will have your tongue too. This is a creature,
3967	Would she begin a sect, might quench the zeal
3968	Of all professors else, make proselytes
3969	Of who she but bid follow.
3970	
3971	PAULINA	How! not women?
3972	
3973	Gentleman	Women will love her, that she is a woman
3974	More worth than any man; men, that she is
3975	The rarest of all women.
3976	
3977	LEONTES	Go, Cleomenes;
3978	Yourself, assisted with your honour'd friends,
3979	Bring them to our embracement. Still, 'tis strange
3980	
3981	[Exeunt CLEOMENES and others]
3982	
3983	He thus should steal upon us.
3984	
3985	PAULINA	Had our prince,
3986	Jewel of children, seen this hour, he had pair'd
3987	Well with this lord: there was not full a month
3988	Between their births.
3989	
3990	LEONTES	Prithee, no more; cease; thou know'st
3991	He dies to me again when talk'd of: sure,
3992	When I shall see this gentleman, thy speeches
3993	Will bring me to consider that which may
3994	Unfurnish me of reason. They are come.
3995	
3996	[Re-enter CLEOMENES and others, with FLORIZEL and PERDITA]
3997	
3998	Your mother was most true to wedlock, prince;
3999	For she did print your royal father off,
4000	Conceiving you: were I but twenty-one,
4001	Your father's image is so hit in you,
4002	His very air, that I should call you brother,
4003	As I did him, and speak of something wildly
4004	By us perform'd before. Most dearly welcome!
4005	And your fair princess,--goddess!--O, alas!
4006	I lost a couple, that 'twixt heaven and earth
4007	Might thus have stood begetting wonder as
4008	You, gracious couple, do: and then I lost--
4009	All mine own folly--the society,
4010	Amity too, of your brave father, whom,
4011	Though bearing misery, I desire my life
4012	Once more to look on him.
4013	
4014	FLORIZEL	By his command
4015	Have I here touch'd Sicilia and from him
4016	Give you all greetings that a king, at friend,
4017	Can send his brother: and, but infirmity
4018	Which waits upon worn times hath something seized
4019	His wish'd ability, he had himself
4020	The lands and waters 'twixt your throne and his
4021	Measured to look upon you; whom he loves--
4022	He bade me say so--more than all the sceptres
4023	And those that bear them living.
4024	
4025	LEONTES	O my brother,
4026	Good gentleman! the wrongs I have done thee stir
4027	Afresh within me, and these thy offices,
4028	So rarely kind, are as interpreters
4029	Of my behind-hand slackness. Welcome hither,
4030	As is the spring to the earth. And hath he too
4031	Exposed this paragon to the fearful usage,
4032	At least ungentle, of the dreadful Neptune,
4033	To greet a man not worth her pains, much less
4034	The adventure of her person?
4035	
4036	FLORIZEL	Good my lord,
4037	She came from Libya.
4038	
4039	LEONTES	Where the warlike Smalus,
4040	That noble honour'd lord, is fear'd and loved?
4041	
4042	FLORIZEL	Most royal sir, from thence; from him, whose daughter
4043	His tears proclaim'd his, parting with her: thence,
4044	A prosperous south-wind friendly, we have cross'd,
4045	To execute the charge my father gave me
4046	For visiting your highness: my best train
4047	I have from your Sicilian shores dismiss'd;
4048	Who for Bohemia bend, to signify
4049	Not only my success in Libya, sir,
4050	But my arrival and my wife's in safety
4051	Here where we are.
4052	
4053	LEONTES	                  The blessed gods
4054	Purge all infection from our air whilst you
4055	Do climate here! You have a holy father,
4056	A graceful gentleman; against whose person,
4057	So sacred as it is, I have done sin:
4058	For which the heavens, taking angry note,
4059	Have left me issueless; and your father's blest,
4060	As he from heaven merits it, with you
4061	Worthy his goodness. What might I have been,
4062	Might I a son and daughter now have look'd on,
4063	Such goodly things as you!
4064	
4065	[Enter a Lord]
4066	
4067	Lord	Most noble sir,
4068	That which I shall report will bear no credit,
4069	Were not the proof so nigh. Please you, great sir,
4070	Bohemia greets you from himself by me;
4071	Desires you to attach his son, who has--
4072	His dignity and duty both cast off--
4073	Fled from his father, from his hopes, and with
4074	A shepherd's daughter.
4075	
4076	LEONTES	Where's Bohemia? speak.
4077	
4078	Lord	Here in your city; I now came from him:
4079	I speak amazedly; and it becomes
4080	My marvel and my message. To your court
4081	Whiles he was hastening, in the chase, it seems,
4082	Of this fair couple, meets he on the way
4083	The father of this seeming lady and
4084	Her brother, having both their country quitted
4085	With this young prince.
4086	
4087	FLORIZEL	Camillo has betray'd me;
4088	Whose honour and whose honesty till now
4089	Endured all weathers.
4090	
4091	Lord	Lay't so to his charge:
4092	He's with the king your father.
4093	
4094	LEONTES	Who? Camillo?
4095	
4096	Lord	Camillo, sir; I spake with him; who now
4097	Has these poor men in question. Never saw I
4098	Wretches so quake: they kneel, they kiss the earth;
4099	Forswear themselves as often as they speak:
4100	Bohemia stops his ears, and threatens them
4101	With divers deaths in death.
4102	
4103	PERDITA	O my poor father!
4104	The heaven sets spies upon us, will not have
4105	Our contract celebrated.
4106	
4107	LEONTES	You are married?
4108	
4109	FLORIZEL	We are not, sir, nor are we like to be;
4110	The stars, I see, will kiss the valleys first:
4111	The odds for high and low's alike.
4112	
4113	LEONTES	My lord,
4114	Is this the daughter of a king?
4115	
4116	FLORIZEL	She is,
4117	When once she is my wife.
4118	
4119	LEONTES	That 'once' I see by your good father's speed
4120	Will come on very slowly. I am sorry,
4121	Most sorry, you have broken from his liking
4122	Where you were tied in duty, and as sorry
4123	Your choice is not so rich in worth as beauty,
4124	That you might well enjoy her.
4125	
4126	FLORIZEL	Dear, look up:
4127	Though Fortune, visible an enemy,
4128	Should chase us with my father, power no jot
4129	Hath she to change our loves. Beseech you, sir,
4130	Remember since you owed no more to time
4131	Than I do now: with thought of such affections,
4132	Step forth mine advocate; at your request
4133	My father will grant precious things as trifles.
4134	
4135	LEONTES	Would he do so, I'ld beg your precious mistress,
4136	Which he counts but a trifle.
4137	
4138	PAULINA	Sir, my liege,
4139	Your eye hath too much youth in't: not a month
4140	'Fore your queen died, she was more worth such gazes
4141	Than what you look on now.
4142	
4143	LEONTES	I thought of her,
4144	Even in these looks I made.
4145	
4146	[To FLORIZEL]
4147	
4148	But your petition
4149	Is yet unanswer'd. I will to your father:
4150	Your honour not o'erthrown by your desires,
4151	I am friend to them and you: upon which errand
4152	I now go toward him; therefore follow me
4153	And mark what way I make: come, good my lord.

4160	THE WINTER'S TALE
4161	
4162	
4163	ACT V
4164	
4165	
4166	
4167	SCENE II	Before LEONTES' palace.
4168	
4169	
4170	[Enter AUTOLYCUS and a Gentleman]
4171	
4172	AUTOLYCUS	Beseech you, sir, were you present at this relation?
4173	
4174	First Gentleman	I was by at the opening of the fardel, heard the old
4175	shepherd deliver the manner how he found it:
4176	whereupon, after a little amazedness, we were all
4177	commanded out of the chamber; only this methought I
4178	heard the shepherd say, he found the child.
4179	
4180	AUTOLYCUS	I would most gladly know the issue of it.
4181	
4182	First Gentleman	I make a broken delivery of the business; but the
4183	changes I perceived in the king and Camillo were
4184	very notes of admiration: they seemed almost, with
4185	staring on one another, to tear the cases of their
4186	eyes; there was speech in their dumbness, language
4187	in their very gesture; they looked as they had heard
4188	of a world ransomed, or one destroyed: a notable
4189	passion of wonder appeared in them; but the wisest
4190	beholder, that knew no more but seeing, could not
4191	say if the importance were joy or sorrow; but in the
4192	extremity of the one, it must needs be.
4193	
4194	[Enter another Gentleman]
4195	
4196	Here comes a gentleman that haply knows more.
4197	The news, Rogero?
4198	
4199	Second Gentleman	Nothing but bonfires: the oracle is fulfilled; the
4200	king's daughter is found: such a deal of wonder is
4201	broken out within this hour that ballad-makers
4202	cannot be able to express it.
4203	
4204	[Enter a third Gentleman]
4205	
4206	Here comes the Lady Paulina's steward: he can
4207	deliver you more. How goes it now, sir? this news
4208	which is called true is so like an old tale, that
4209	the verity of it is in strong suspicion: has the king
4210	found his heir?
4211	
4212	Third Gentleman	Most true, if ever truth were pregnant by
4213	circumstance: that which you hear you'll swear you
4214	see, there is such unity in the proofs. The mantle
4215	of Queen Hermione's, her jewel about the neck of it,
4216	the letters of Antigonus found with it which they
4217	know to be his character, the majesty of the
4218	creature in resemblance of the mother, the affection
4219	of nobleness which nature shows above her breeding,
4220	and many other evidences proclaim her with all
4221	certainty to be the king's daughter. Did you see
4222	the meeting of the two kings?
4223	
4224	Second Gentleman	No.
4225	
4226	Third Gentleman	Then have you lost a sight, which was to be seen,
4227	cannot be spoken of. There might you have beheld one
4228	joy crown another, so and in such manner that it
4229	seemed sorrow wept to take leave of them, for their
4230	joy waded in tears. There was casting up of eyes,
4231	holding up of hands, with countenances of such
4232	distraction that they were to be known by garment,
4233	not by favour. Our king, being ready to leap out of
4234	himself for joy of his found daughter, as if that
4235	joy were now become a loss, cries 'O, thy mother,
4236	thy mother!' then asks Bohemia forgiveness; then
4237	embraces his son-in-law; then again worries he his
4238	daughter with clipping her; now he thanks the old
4239	shepherd, which stands by like a weather-bitten
4240	conduit of many kings' reigns. I never heard of such
4241	another encounter, which lames report to follow it
4242	and undoes description to do it.
4243	
4244	Second Gentleman	What, pray you, became of Antigonus, that carried
4245	hence the child?
4246	
4247	Third Gentleman	Like an old tale still, which will have matter to
4248	rehearse, though credit be asleep and not an ear
4249	open. He was torn to pieces with a bear: this
4250	avouches the shepherd's son; who has not only his
4251	innocence, which seems much, to justify him, but a
4252	handkerchief and rings of his that Paulina knows.
4253	
4254	First Gentleman	What became of his bark and his followers?
4255	
4256	Third Gentleman	Wrecked the same instant of their master's death and
4257	in the view of the shepherd: so that all the
4258	instruments which aided to expose the child were
4259	even then lost when it was found. But O, the noble
4260	combat that 'twixt joy and sorrow was fought in
4261	Paulina! She had one eye declined for the loss of
4262	her husband, another elevated that the oracle was
4263	fulfilled: she lifted the princess from the earth,
4264	and so locks her in embracing, as if she would pin
4265	her to her heart that she might no more be in danger
4266	of losing.
4267	
4268	First Gentleman	The dignity of this act was worth the audience of
4269	kings and princes; for by such was it acted.
4270	
4271	Third Gentleman	One of the prettiest touches of all and that which
4272	angled for mine eyes, caught the water though not
4273	the fish, was when, at the relation of the queen's
4274	death, with the manner how she came to't bravely
4275	confessed and lamented by the king, how
4276	attentiveness wounded his daughter; till, from one
4277	sign of dolour to another, she did, with an 'Alas,'
4278	I would fain say, bleed tears, for I am sure my
4279	heart wept blood. Who was most marble there changed
4280	colour; some swooned, all sorrowed: if all the world
4281	could have seen 't, the woe had been universal.
4282	
4283	First Gentleman	Are they returned to the court?
4284	
4285	Third Gentleman	No: the princess hearing of her mother's statue,
4286	which is in the keeping of Paulina,--a piece many
4287	years in doing and now newly performed by that rare
4288	Italian master, Julio Romano, who, had he himself
4289	eternity and could put breath into his work, would
4290	beguile Nature of her custom, so perfectly he is her
4291	ape: he so near to Hermione hath done Hermione that
4292	they say one would speak to her and stand in hope of
4293	answer: thither with all greediness of affection
4294	are they gone, and there they intend to sup.
4295	
4296	Second Gentleman	I thought she had some great matter there in hand;
4297	for she hath privately twice or thrice a day, ever
4298	since the death of Hermione, visited that removed
4299	house. Shall we thither and with our company piece
4300	the rejoicing?
4301	
4302	First Gentleman	Who would be thence that has the benefit of access?
4303	every wink of an eye some new grace will be born:
4304	our absence makes us unthrifty to our knowledge.
4305	Let's along.
4306	
4307	[Exeunt Gentlemen]
4308	
4309	AUTOLYCUS	Now, had I not the dash of my former life in me,
4310	would preferment drop on my head. I brought the old
4311	man and his son aboard the prince: told him I heard
4312	them talk of a fardel and I know not what: but he
4313	at that time, overfond of the shepherd's daughter,
4314	so he then took her to be, who began to be much
4315	sea-sick, and himself little better, extremity of
4316	weather continuing, this mystery remained
4317	undiscovered. But 'tis all one to me; for had I
4318	been the finder out of this secret, it would not
4319	have relished among my other discredits.
4320	
4321	[Enter Shepherd and Clown]
4322	
4323	Here come those I have done good to against my will,
4324	and already appearing in the blossoms of their fortune.
4325	
4326	Shepherd	Come, boy; I am past moe children, but thy sons and
4327	daughters will be all gentlemen born.
4328	
4329	Clown	You are well met, sir. You denied to fight with me
4330	this other day, because I was no gentleman born.
4331	See you these clothes? say you see them not and
4332	think me still no gentleman born: you were best say
4333	these robes are not gentlemen born: give me the
4334	lie, do, and try whether I am not now a gentleman born.
4335	
4336	AUTOLYCUS	I know you are now, sir, a gentleman born.
4337	
4338	Clown	Ay, and have been so any time these four hours.
4339	
4340	Shepherd	And so have I, boy.
4341	
4342	Clown	So you have: but I was a gentleman born before my
4343	father; for the king's son took me by the hand, and
4344	called me brother; and then the two kings called my
4345	father brother; and then the prince my brother and
4346	the princess my sister called my father father; and
4347	so we wept, and there was the first gentleman-like
4348	tears that ever we shed.
4349	
4350	Shepherd	We may live, son, to shed many more.
4351	
4352	Clown	Ay; or else 'twere hard luck, being in so
4353	preposterous estate as we are.
4354	
4355	AUTOLYCUS	I humbly beseech you, sir, to pardon me all the
4356	faults I have committed to your worship and to give
4357	me your good report to the prince my master.
4358	
4359	Shepherd	Prithee, son, do; for we must be gentle, now we are
4360	gentlemen.
4361	
4362	Clown	Thou wilt amend thy life?
4363	
4364	AUTOLYCUS	Ay, an it like your good worship.
4365	
4366	Clown	Give me thy hand: I will swear to the prince thou
4367	art as honest a true fellow as any is in Bohemia.
4368	
4369	Shepherd	You may say it, but not swear it.
4370	
4371	Clown	Not swear it, now I am a gentleman? Let boors and
4372	franklins say it, I'll swear it.
4373	
4374	Shepherd	How if it be false, son?
4375	
4376	Clown	If it be ne'er so false, a true gentleman may swear
4377	it in the behalf of his friend: and I'll swear to
4378	the prince thou art a tall fellow of thy hands and
4379	that thou wilt not be drunk; but I know thou art no
4380	tall fellow of thy hands and that thou wilt be
4381	drunk: but I'll swear it, and I would thou wouldst
4382	be a tall fellow of thy hands.
4383	
4384	AUTOLYCUS	I will prove so, sir, to my power.
4385	
4386	Clown	Ay, by any means prove a tall fellow: if I do not
4387	wonder how thou darest venture to be drunk, not
4388	being a tall fellow, trust me not. Hark! the kings
4389	and the princes, our kindred, are going to see the
4390	queen's picture. Come, follow us: we'll be thy
4391	good masters.
4392

4398	THE WINTER'S TALE
4399	
4400	
4401	ACT V
4402	
4403	
4404	
4405	SCENE III	A chapel in PAULINA'S house.
4406	
4407	
4408	[Enter LEONTES, POLIXENES, FLORIZEL, PERDITA,
4409	CAMILLO, PAULINA, Lords, and Attendants]
4410	
4411	LEONTES	O grave and good Paulina, the great comfort
4412	That I have had of thee!
4413	
4414	PAULINA	What, sovereign sir,
4415	I did not well I meant well. All my services
4416	You have paid home: but that you have vouchsafed,
4417	With your crown'd brother and these your contracted
4418	Heirs of your kingdoms, my poor house to visit,
4419	It is a surplus of your grace, which never
4420	My life may last to answer.
4421	
4422	LEONTES	O Paulina,
4423	We honour you with trouble: but we came
4424	To see the statue of our queen: your gallery
4425	Have we pass'd through, not without much content
4426	In many singularities; but we saw not
4427	That which my daughter came to look upon,
4428	The statue of her mother.
4429	
4430	PAULINA	As she lived peerless,
4431	So her dead likeness, I do well believe,
4432	Excels whatever yet you look'd upon
4433	Or hand of man hath done; therefore I keep it
4434	Lonely, apart. But here it is: prepare
4435	To see the life as lively mock'd as ever
4436	Still sleep mock'd death: behold, and say 'tis well.
4437	
4438	[PAULINA draws a curtain, and discovers HERMIONE
4439	standing like a statue]
4440	
4441	I like your silence, it the more shows off
4442	Your wonder: but yet speak; first, you, my liege,
4443	Comes it not something near?
4444	
4445	LEONTES	Her natural posture!
4446	Chide me, dear stone, that I may say indeed
4447	Thou art Hermione; or rather, thou art she
4448	In thy not chiding, for she was as tender
4449	As infancy and grace. But yet, Paulina,
4450	Hermione was not so much wrinkled, nothing
4451	So aged as this seems.
4452	
4453	POLIXENES	O, not by much.
4454	
4455	PAULINA	So much the more our carver's excellence;
4456	Which lets go by some sixteen years and makes her
4457	As she lived now.
4458	
4459	LEONTES	                  As now she might have done,
4460	So much to my good comfort, as it is
4461	Now piercing to my soul. O, thus she stood,
4462	Even with such life of majesty, warm life,
4463	As now it coldly stands, when first I woo'd her!
4464	I am ashamed: does not the stone rebuke me
4465	For being more stone than it? O royal piece,
4466	There's magic in thy majesty, which has
4467	My evils conjured to remembrance and
4468	From thy admiring daughter took the spirits,
4469	Standing like stone with thee.
4470	
4471	PERDITA	And give me leave,
4472	And do not say 'tis superstition, that
4473	I kneel and then implore her blessing. Lady,
4474	Dear queen, that ended when I but began,
4475	Give me that hand of yours to kiss.
4476	
4477	PAULINA	O, patience!
4478	The statue is but newly fix'd, the colour's Not dry.
4479	
4480	CAMILLO	My lord, your sorrow was too sore laid on,
4481	Which sixteen winters cannot blow away,
4482	So many summers dry; scarce any joy
4483	Did ever so long live; no sorrow
4484	But kill'd itself much sooner.
4485	
4486	POLIXENES	Dear my brother,
4487	Let him that was the cause of this have power
4488	To take off so much grief from you as he
4489	Will piece up in himself.
4490	
4491	PAULINA	Indeed, my lord,
4492	If I had thought the sight of my poor image
4493	Would thus have wrought you,--for the stone is mine--
4494	I'ld not have show'd it.
4495	
4496	LEONTES	Do not draw the curtain.
4497	
4498	PAULINA	No longer shall you gaze on't, lest your fancy
4499	May think anon it moves.
4500	
4501	LEONTES	Let be, let be.
4502	Would I were dead, but that, methinks, already--
4503	What was he that did make it? See, my lord,
4504	Would you not deem it breathed? and that those veins
4505	Did verily bear blood?
4506	
4507	POLIXENES	Masterly done:
4508	The very life seems warm upon her lip.
4509	
4510	LEONTES	The fixture of her eye has motion in't,
4511	As we are mock'd with art.
4512	
4513	PAULINA	I'll draw the curtain:
4514	My lord's almost so far transported that
4515	He'll think anon it lives.
4516	
4517	LEONTES	O sweet Paulina,
4518	Make me to think so twenty years together!
4519	No settled senses of the world can match
4520	The pleasure of that madness. Let 't alone.
4521	
4522	PAULINA	I am sorry, sir, I have thus far stirr'd you: but
4523	I could afflict you farther.
4524	
4525	LEONTES	Do, Paulina;
4526	For this affliction has a taste as sweet
4527	As any cordial comfort. Still, methinks,
4528	There is an air comes from her: what fine chisel
4529	Could ever yet cut breath? Let no man mock me,
4530	For I will kiss her.
4531	
4532	PAULINA	Good my lord, forbear:
4533	The ruddiness upon her lip is wet;
4534	You'll mar it if you kiss it, stain your own
4535	With oily painting. Shall I draw the curtain?
4536	
4537	LEONTES	No, not these twenty years.
4538	
4539	PERDITA	So long could I
4540	Stand by, a looker on.
4541	
4542	PAULINA	Either forbear,
4543	Quit presently the chapel, or resolve you
4544	For more amazement. If you can behold it,
4545	I'll make the statue move indeed, descend
4546	And take you by the hand; but then you'll think--
4547	Which I protest against--I am assisted
4548	By wicked powers.
4549	
4550	LEONTES	                  What you can make her do,
4551	I am content to look on: what to speak,
4552	I am content to hear; for 'tis as easy
4553	To make her speak as move.
4554	
4555	PAULINA	It is required
4556	You do awake your faith. Then all stand still;
4557	On: those that think it is unlawful business
4558	I am about, let them depart.
4559	
4560	LEONTES	Proceed:
4561	No foot shall stir.
4562	
4563	PAULINA	Music, awake her; strike!
4564	
4565	[Music]
4566	
4567	'Tis time; descend; be stone no more; approach;
4568	Strike all that look upon with marvel. Come,
4569	I'll fill your grave up: stir, nay, come away,
4570	Bequeath to death your numbness, for from him
4571	Dear life redeems you. You perceive she stirs:
4572	
4573	[HERMIONE comes down]
4574	
4575	Start not; her actions shall be holy as
4576	You hear my spell is lawful: do not shun her
4577	Until you see her die again; for then
4578	You kill her double. Nay, present your hand:
4579	When she was young you woo'd her; now in age
4580	Is she become the suitor?
4581	
4582	LEONTES	O, she's warm!
4583	If this be magic, let it be an art
4584	Lawful as eating.
4585	
4586	POLIXENES	                  She embraces him.
4587	
4588	CAMILLO	She hangs about his neck:
4589	If she pertain to life let her speak too.
4590	
4591	POLIXENES	Ay, and make't manifest where she has lived,
4592	Or how stolen from the dead.
4593	
4594	PAULINA	That she is living,
4595	Were it but told you, should be hooted at
4596	Like an old tale: but it appears she lives,
4597	Though yet she speak not. Mark a little while.
4598	Please you to interpose, fair madam: kneel
4599	And pray your mother's blessing. Turn, good lady;
4600	Our Perdita is found.
4601	
4602	HERMIONE	You gods, look down
4603	And from your sacred vials pour your graces
4604	Upon my daughter's head! Tell me, mine own.
4605	Where hast thou been preserved? where lived? how found
4606	Thy father's court? for thou shalt hear that I,
4607	Knowing by Paulina that the oracle
4608	Gave hope thou wast in being, have preserved
4609	Myself to see the issue.
4610	
4611	PAULINA	There's time enough for that;
4612	Lest they desire upon this push to trouble
4613	Your joys with like relation. Go together,
4614	You precious winners all; your exultation
4615	Partake to every one. I, an old turtle,
4616	Will wing me to some wither'd bough and there
4617	My mate, that's never to be found again,
4618	Lament till I am lost.
4619	
4620	LEONTES	O, peace, Paulina!
4621	Thou shouldst a husband take by my consent,
4622	As I by thine a wife: this is a match,
4623	And made between's by vows. Thou hast found mine;
4624	But how, is to be question'd; for I saw her,
4625	As I thought, dead, and have in vain said many
4626	A prayer upon her grave. I'll not seek far--
4627	For him, I partly know his mind--to find thee
4628	An honourable husband. Come, Camillo,
4629	And take her by the hand, whose worth and honesty
4630	Is richly noted and here justified
4631	By us, a pair of kings. Let's from this place.
4632	What! look upon my brother: both your pardons,
4633	That e'er I put between your holy looks
4634	My ill suspicion. This is your son-in-law,
4635	And son unto the king, who, heavens directing,
4636	Is troth-plight to your daughter. Good Paulina,
4637	Lead us from hence, where we may leisurely
4638	Each one demand an answer to his part
4639	Perform'd in this wide gap of time since first
4640	We were dissever'd: hastily lead away.
4641	
4642	[Exeunt]

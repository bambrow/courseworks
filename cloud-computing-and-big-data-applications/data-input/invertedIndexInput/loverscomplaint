3	
4	FROM off a hill whose concave womb reworded
5	A plaintful story from a sistering vale,
6	My spirits to attend this double voice accorded,
7	And down I laid to list the sad-tuned tale;
8	Ere long espied a fickle maid full pale,
9	Tearing of papers, breaking rings a-twain,
10	Storming her world with sorrow's wind and rain.
11	
12	Upon her head a platted hive of straw,
13	Which fortified her visage from the sun,
14	Whereon the thought might think sometime it saw
15	The carcass of beauty spent and done:
16	Time had not scythed all that youth begun,
17	Nor youth all quit; but, spite of heaven's fell rage,
18	Some beauty peep'd through lattice of sear'd age.
19	
20	Oft did she heave her napkin to her eyne,
21	Which on it had conceited characters,
22	Laundering the silken figures in the brine
23	That season'd woe had pelleted in tears,
24	And often reading what contents it bears;
25	As often shrieking undistinguish'd woe,
26	In clamours of all size, both high and low.
27	
28	Sometimes her levell'd eyes their carriage ride,
29	As they did battery to the spheres intend;
30	Sometime diverted their poor balls are tied
31	To the orbed earth; sometimes they do extend
32	Their view right on; anon their gazes lend
33	To every place at once, and, nowhere fix'd,
34	The mind and sight distractedly commix'd.
35	
36	Her hair, nor loose nor tied in formal plat,
37	Proclaim'd in her a careless hand of pride
38	For some, untuck'd, descended her sheaved hat,
39	Hanging her pale and pined cheek beside;
40	Some in her threaden fillet still did bide,
41	And true to bondage would not break from thence,
42	Though slackly braided in loose negligence.
43	
44	A thousand favours from a maund she drew
45	Of amber, crystal, and of beaded jet,
46	Which one by one she in a river threw,
47	Upon whose weeping margent she was set;
48	Like usury, applying wet to wet,
49	Or monarch's hands that let not bounty fall
50	Where want cries some, but where excess begs all.
51	
52	Of folded schedules had she many a one,
53	Which she perused, sigh'd, tore, and gave the flood;
54	Crack'd many a ring of posied gold and bone
55	Bidding them find their sepulchres in mud;
56	Found yet moe letters sadly penn'd in blood,
57	With sleided silk feat and affectedly
58	Enswathed, and seal'd to curious secrecy.
59	
60	These often bathed she in her fluxive eyes,
61	And often kiss'd, and often 'gan to tear:
62	Cried 'O false blood, thou register of lies,
63	What unapproved witness dost thou bear!
64	Ink would have seem'd more black and damned here!'
65	This said, in top of rage the lines she rents,
66	Big discontent so breaking their contents.
67	
68	A reverend man that grazed his cattle nigh--
69	Sometime a blusterer, that the ruffle knew
70	Of court, of city, and had let go by
71	The swiftest hours, observed as they flew--
72	Towards this afflicted fancy fastly drew,
73	And, privileged by age, desires to know
74	In brief the grounds and motives of her woe.
75	
76	So slides he down upon his grained bat,
77	And comely-distant sits he by her side;
78	When he again desires her, being sat,
79	Her grievance with his hearing to divide:
80	If that from him there may be aught applied
81	Which may her suffering ecstasy assuage,
82	'Tis promised in the charity of age.
83	
84	'Father,' she says, 'though in me you behold
85	The injury of many a blasting hour,
86	Let it not tell your judgment I am old;
87	Not age, but sorrow, over me hath power:
88	I might as yet have been a spreading flower,
89	Fresh to myself, If I had self-applied
90	Love to myself and to no love beside.
91	
92	'But, woe is me! too early I attended
93	A youthful suit--it was to gain my grace--
94	Of one by nature's outwards so commended,
95	That maidens' eyes stuck over all his face:
96	Love lack'd a dwelling, and made him her place;
97	And when in his fair parts she did abide,
98	She was new lodged and newly deified.
99	
100	'His browny locks did hang in crooked curls;
101	And every light occasion of the wind
102	Upon his lips their silken parcels hurls.
103	What's sweet to do, to do will aptly find:
104	Each eye that saw him did enchant the mind,
105	For on his visage was in little drawn
106	What largeness thinks in Paradise was sawn.
107	
108	'Small show of man was yet upon his chin;
109	His phoenix down began but to appear
110	Like unshorn velvet on that termless skin
111	Whose bare out-bragg'd the web it seem'd to wear:
112	Yet show'd his visage by that cost more dear;
113	And nice affections wavering stood in doubt
114	If best were as it was, or best without.
115	
116	'His qualities were beauteous as his form,
117	For maiden-tongued he was, and thereof free;
118	Yet, if men moved him, was he such a storm
119	As oft 'twixt May and April is to see,
120	When winds breathe sweet, untidy though they be.
121	His rudeness so with his authorized youth
122	Did livery falseness in a pride of truth.
123	
124	'Well could he ride, and often men would say
125	'That horse his mettle from his rider takes:
126	Proud of subjection, noble by the sway,
127	What rounds, what bounds, what course, what stop
128	he makes!'
129	And controversy hence a question takes,
130	Whether the horse by him became his deed,
131	Or he his manage by the well-doing steed.
132	
133	'But quickly on this side the verdict went:
134	His real habitude gave life and grace
135	To appertainings and to ornament,
136	Accomplish'd in himself, not in his case:
137	All aids, themselves made fairer by their place,
138	Came for additions; yet their purposed trim
139	Pieced not his grace, but were all graced by him.
140	
141	'So on the tip of his subduing tongue
142	All kinds of arguments and question deep,
143	All replication prompt, and reason strong,
144	For his advantage still did wake and sleep:
145	To make the weeper laugh, the laugher weep,
146	He had the dialect and different skill,
147	Catching all passions in his craft of will:
148	
149	'That he did in the general bosom reign
150	Of young, of old; and sexes both enchanted,
151	To dwell with him in thoughts, or to remain
152	In personal duty, following where he haunted:
153	Consents bewitch'd, ere he desire, have granted;
154	And dialogued for him what he would say,
155	Ask'd their own wills, and made their wills obey.
156	
157	'Many there were that did his picture get,
158	To serve their eyes, and in it put their mind;
159	Like fools that in th' imagination set
160	The goodly objects which abroad they find
161	Of lands and mansions, theirs in thought assign'd;
162	And labouring in moe pleasures to bestow them
163	Than the true gouty landlord which doth owe them:
164	
165	'So many have, that never touch'd his hand,
166	Sweetly supposed them mistress of his heart.
167	My woeful self, that did in freedom stand,
168	And was my own fee-simple, not in part,
169	What with his art in youth, and youth in art,
170	Threw my affections in his charmed power,
171	Reserved the stalk and gave him all my flower.
172	
173	'Yet did I not, as some my equals did,
174	Demand of him, nor being desired yielded;
175	Finding myself in honour so forbid,
176	With safest distance I mine honour shielded:
177	Experience for me many bulwarks builded
178	Of proofs new-bleeding, which remain'd the foil
179	Of this false jewel, and his amorous spoil.
180	
181	'But, ah, who ever shunn'd by precedent
182	The destined ill she must herself assay?
183	Or forced examples, 'gainst her own content,
184	To put the by-past perils in her way?
185	Counsel may stop awhile what will not stay;
186	For when we rage, advice is often seen
187	By blunting us to make our wits more keen.
188	
189	'Nor gives it satisfaction to our blood,
190	That we must curb it upon others' proof;
191	To be forbod the sweets that seem so good,
192	For fear of harms that preach in our behoof.
193	O appetite, from judgment stand aloof!
194	The one a palate hath that needs will taste,
195	Though Reason weep, and cry, 'It is thy last.'
196	
197	'For further I could say 'This man's untrue,'
198	And knew the patterns of his foul beguiling;
199	Heard where his plants in others' orchards grew,
200	Saw how deceits were gilded in his smiling;
201	Knew vows were ever brokers to defiling;
202	Thought characters and words merely but art,
203	And bastards of his foul adulterate heart.
204	
205	'And long upon these terms I held my city,
206	Till thus he gan besiege me: 'Gentle maid,
207	Have of my suffering youth some feeling pity,
208	And be not of my holy vows afraid:
209	That's to ye sworn to none was ever said;
210	For feasts of love I have been call'd unto,
211	Till now did ne'er invite, nor never woo.
212	
213	''All my offences that abroad you see
214	Are errors of the blood, none of the mind;
215	Love made them not: with acture they may be,
216	Where neither party is nor true nor kind:
217	They sought their shame that so their shame did find;
218	And so much less of shame in me remains,
219	By how much of me their reproach contains.
220	
221	''Among the many that mine eyes have seen,
222	Not one whose flame my heart so much as warm'd,
223	Or my affection put to the smallest teen,
224	Or any of my leisures ever charm'd:
225	Harm have I done to them, but ne'er was harm'd;
226	Kept hearts in liveries, but mine own was free,
227	And reign'd, commanding in his monarchy.
228	
229	''Look here, what tributes wounded fancies sent me,
230	Of paled pearls and rubies red as blood;
231	Figuring that they their passions likewise lent me
232	Of grief and blushes, aptly understood
233	In bloodless white and the encrimson'd mood;
234	Effects of terror and dear modesty,
235	Encamp'd in hearts, but fighting outwardly.
236	
237	''And, lo, behold these talents of their hair,
238	With twisted metal amorously impleach'd,
239	I have received from many a several fair,
240	Their kind acceptance weepingly beseech'd,
241	With the annexions of fair gems enrich'd,
242	And deep-brain'd sonnets that did amplify
243	Each stone's dear nature, worth, and quality.
244	
245	''The diamond,--why, 'twas beautiful and hard,
246	Whereto his invised properties did tend;
247	The deep-green emerald, in whose fresh regard
248	Weak sights their sickly radiance do amend;
249	The heaven-hued sapphire and the opal blend
250	With objects manifold: each several stone,
251	With wit well blazon'd, smiled or made some moan.
252	
253	''Lo, all these trophies of affections hot,
254	Of pensived and subdued desires the tender,
255	Nature hath charged me that I hoard them not,
256	But yield them up where I myself must render,
257	That is, to you, my origin and ender;
258	For these, of force, must your oblations be,
259	Since I their altar, you enpatron me.
260	
261	''O, then, advance of yours that phraseless hand,
262	Whose white weighs down the airy scale of praise;
263	Take all these similes to your own command,
264	Hallow'd with sighs that burning lungs did raise;
265	What me your minister, for you obeys,
266	Works under you; and to your audit comes
267	Their distract parcels in combined sums.
268	
269	''Lo, this device was sent me from a nun,
270	Or sister sanctified, of holiest note;
271	Which late her noble suit in court did shun,
272	Whose rarest havings made the blossoms dote;
273	For she was sought by spirits of richest coat,
274	But kept cold distance, and did thence remove,
275	To spend her living in eternal love.
276	
277	''But, O my sweet, what labour is't to leave
278	The thing we have not, mastering what not strives,
279	Playing the place which did no form receive,
280	Playing patient sports in unconstrained gyves?
281	She that her fame so to herself contrives,
282	The scars of battle 'scapeth by the flight,
283	And makes her absence valiant, not her might.
284	
285	''O, pardon me, in that my boast is true:
286	The accident which brought me to her eye
287	Upon the moment did her force subdue,
288	And now she would the caged cloister fly:
289	Religious love put out Religion's eye:
290	Not to be tempted, would she be immured,
291	And now, to tempt, all liberty procured.
292	
293	''How mighty then you are, O, hear me tell!
294	The broken bosoms that to me belong
295	Have emptied all their fountains in my well,
296	And mine I pour your ocean all among:
297	I strong o'er them, and you o'er me being strong,
298	Must for your victory us all congest,
299	As compound love to physic your cold breast.
300	
301	''My parts had power to charm a sacred nun,
302	Who, disciplined, ay, dieted in grace,
303	Believed her eyes when they to assail begun,
304	All vows and consecrations giving place:
305	O most potential love! vow, bond, nor space,
306	In thee hath neither sting, knot, nor confine,
307	For thou art all, and all things else are thine.
308	
309	''When thou impressest, what are precepts worth
310	Of stale example? When thou wilt inflame,
311	How coldly those impediments stand forth
312	Of wealth, of filial fear, law, kindred, fame!
313	Love's arms are peace, 'gainst rule, 'gainst sense,
314	'gainst shame,
315	And sweetens, in the suffering pangs it bears,
316	The aloes of all forces, shocks, and fears.
317	
318	''Now all these hearts that do on mine depend,
319	Feeling it break, with bleeding groans they pine;
320	And supplicant their sighs to you extend,
321	To leave the battery that you make 'gainst mine,
322	Lending soft audience to my sweet design,
323	And credent soul to that strong-bonded oath
324	That shall prefer and undertake my troth.'
325	
326	'This said, his watery eyes he did dismount,
327	Whose sights till then were levell'd on my face;
328	Each cheek a river running from a fount
329	With brinish current downward flow'd apace:
330	O, how the channel to the stream gave grace!
331	Who glazed with crystal gate the glowing roses
332	That flame through water which their hue encloses.
333	
334	'O father, what a hell of witchcraft lies
335	In the small orb of one particular tear!
336	But with the inundation of the eyes
337	What rocky heart to water will not wear?
338	What breast so cold that is not warmed here?
339	O cleft effect! cold modesty, hot wrath,
340	Both fire from hence and chill extincture hath.
341	
342	'For, lo, his passion, but an art of craft,
343	Even there resolved my reason into tears;
344	There my white stole of chastity I daff'd,
345	Shook off my sober guards and civil fears;
346	Appear to him, as he to me appears,
347	All melting; though our drops this difference bore,
348	His poison'd me, and mine did him restore.
349	
350	'In him a plenitude of subtle matter,
351	Applied to cautels, all strange forms receives,
352	Of burning blushes, or of weeping water,
353	Or swooning paleness; and he takes and leaves,
354	In either's aptness, as it best deceives,
355	To blush at speeches rank to weep at woes,
356	Or to turn white and swoon at tragic shows.
357	
358	'That not a heart which in his level came
359	Could 'scape the hail of his all-hurting aim,
360	Showing fair nature is both kind and tame;
361	And, veil'd in them, did win whom he would maim:
362	Against the thing he sought he would exclaim;
363	When he most burn'd in heart-wish'd luxury,
364	He preach'd pure maid, and praised cold chastity.
365	
366	'Thus merely with the garment of a Grace
367	The naked and concealed fiend he cover'd;
368	That th' unexperient gave the tempter place,
369	Which like a cherubin above them hover'd.
370	Who, young and simple, would not be so lover'd?
371	Ay me! I fell; and yet do question make
372	What I should do again for such a sake.
373	
374	'O, that infected moisture of his eye,
375	O, that false fire which in his cheek so glow'd,
376	O, that forced thunder from his heart did fly,
377	O, that sad breath his spongy lungs bestow'd,
378	O, all that borrow'd motion seeming owed,
379	Would yet again betray the fore-betray'd,
380	And new pervert a reconciled maid!'

100	
101	
102	ACT I
103	
104	
105	
106	SCENE I	Athens. A hall in Timon's house.
107	
108	
109	[Enter Poet, Painter, Jeweller, Merchant, and
110	others, at several doors]
111	
112	Poet	Good day, sir.
113	
114	Painter	                  I am glad you're well.
115	
116	Poet	I have not seen you long: how goes the world?
117	
118	Painter	It wears, sir, as it grows.
119	
120	Poet	Ay, that's well known:
121	But what particular rarity? what strange,
122	Which manifold record not matches? See,
123	Magic of bounty! all these spirits thy power
124	Hath conjured to attend. I know the merchant.
125	
126	Painter	I know them both; th' other's a jeweller.
127	
128	Merchant	O, 'tis a worthy lord.
129	
130	Jeweller	Nay, that's most fix'd.
131	
132	Merchant	A most incomparable man, breathed, as it were,
133	To an untirable and continuate goodness:
134	He passes.
135	
136	Jeweller:	I have a jewel here--
137	
138	Merchant	O, pray, let's see't: for the Lord Timon, sir?
139	
140	Jeweller:	If he will touch the estimate: but, for that--
141	
142	Poet	[Reciting to himself]  'When we for recompense have
143	praised the vile,
144	It stains the glory in that happy verse
145	Which aptly sings the good.'
146	
147	Merchant	'Tis a good form.
148	
149	[Looking at the jewel]
150	
151	Jeweller	And rich: here is a water, look ye.
152	
153	Painter	You are rapt, sir, in some work, some dedication
154	To the great lord.
155	
156	Poet	                  A thing slipp'd idly from me.
157	Our poesy is as a gum, which oozes
158	From whence 'tis nourish'd: the fire i' the flint
159	Shows not till it be struck; our gentle flame
160	Provokes itself and like the current flies
161	Each bound it chafes. What have you there?
162	
163	Painter	A picture, sir. When comes your book forth?
164	
165	Poet	Upon the heels of my presentment, sir.
166	Let's see your piece.
167	
168	Painter	'Tis a good piece.
169	
170	Poet	So 'tis: this comes off well and excellent.
171	
172	Painter	Indifferent.
173	
174	Poet	                  Admirable: how this grace
175	Speaks his own standing! what a mental power
176	This eye shoots forth! how big imagination
177	Moves in this lip! to the dumbness of the gesture
178	One might interpret.
179	
180	Painter	It is a pretty mocking of the life.
181	Here is a touch; is't good?
182	
183	Poet	I will say of it,
184	It tutors nature: artificial strife
185	Lives in these touches, livelier than life.
186	
187	[Enter certain Senators, and pass over]
188	
189	Painter	How this lord is follow'd!
190	
191	Poet	The senators of Athens: happy man!
192	
193	Painter	Look, more!
194	
195	Poet	You see this confluence, this great flood
196	of visitors.
197	I have, in this rough work, shaped out a man,
198	Whom this beneath world doth embrace and hug
199	With amplest entertainment: my free drift
200	Halts not particularly, but moves itself
201	In a wide sea of wax: no levell'd malice
202	Infects one comma in the course I hold;
203	But flies an eagle flight, bold and forth on,
204	Leaving no tract behind.
205	
206	Painter	How shall I understand you?
207	
208	Poet	I will unbolt to you.
209	You see how all conditions, how all minds,
210	As well of glib and slippery creatures as
211	Of grave and austere quality, tender down
212	Their services to Lord Timon: his large fortune
213	Upon his good and gracious nature hanging
214	Subdues and properties to his love and tendance
215	All sorts of hearts; yea, from the glass-faced flatterer
216	To Apemantus, that few things loves better
217	Than to abhor himself: even he drops down
218	The knee before him, and returns in peace
219	Most rich in Timon's nod.
220	
221	Painter	I saw them speak together.
222	
223	Poet	Sir, I have upon a high and pleasant hill
224	Feign'd Fortune to be throned: the base o' the mount
225	Is rank'd with all deserts, all kind of natures,
226	That labour on the bosom of this sphere
227	To propagate their states: amongst them all,
228	Whose eyes are on this sovereign lady fix'd,
229	One do I personate of Lord Timon's frame,
230	Whom Fortune with her ivory hand wafts to her;
231	Whose present grace to present slaves and servants
232	Translates his rivals.
233	
234	Painter	'Tis conceived to scope.
235	This throne, this Fortune, and this hill, methinks,
236	With one man beckon'd from the rest below,
237	Bowing his head against the sleepy mount
238	To climb his happiness, would be well express'd
239	In our condition.
240	
241	Poet	                  Nay, sir, but hear me on.
242	All those which were his fellows but of late,
243	Some better than his value, on the moment
244	Follow his strides, his lobbies fill with tendance,
245	Rain sacrificial whisperings in his ear,
246	Make sacred even his stirrup, and through him
247	Drink the free air.
248	
249	Painter	Ay, marry, what of these?
250	
251	Poet	When Fortune in her shift and change of mood
252	Spurns down her late beloved, all his dependants
253	Which labour'd after him to the mountain's top
254	Even on their knees and hands, let him slip down,
255	Not one accompanying his declining foot.
256	
257	Painter	'Tis common:
258	A thousand moral paintings I can show
259	That shall demonstrate these quick blows of Fortune's
260	More pregnantly than words. Yet you do well
261	To show Lord Timon that mean eyes have seen
262	The foot above the head.
263	
264	[Trumpets sound. Enter TIMON, addressing himself
265	courteously to every suitor; a Messenger from
266	VENTIDIUS talking with him; LUCILIUS and other
267	servants following]
268	
269	TIMON	Imprison'd is he, say you?
270	
271	Messenger	Ay, my good lord: five talents is his debt,
272	His means most short, his creditors most strait:
273	Your honourable letter he desires
274	To those have shut him up; which failing,
275	Periods his comfort.
276	
277	TIMON	Noble Ventidius! Well;
278	I am not of that feather to shake off
279	My friend when he must need me. I do know him
280	A gentleman that well deserves a help:
281	Which he shall have: I'll pay the debt,
282	and free him.
283	
284	Messenger	Your lordship ever binds him.
285	
286	TIMON	Commend me to him: I will send his ransom;
287	And being enfranchised, bid him come to me.
288	'Tis not enough to help the feeble up,
289	But to support him after. Fare you well.
290	
291	Messenger	All happiness to your honour!
292	
293	[Exit]
294	
295	[Enter an old Athenian]
296	
297	Old Athenian	Lord Timon, hear me speak.
298	
299	TIMON	Freely, good father.
300	
301	Old Athenian	Thou hast a servant named Lucilius.
302	
303	TIMON	I have so: what of him?
304	
305	Old Athenian	Most noble Timon, call the man before thee.
306	
307	TIMON	Attends he here, or no? Lucilius!
308	
309	LUCILIUS	Here, at your lordship's service.
310	
311	Old Athenian	This fellow here, Lord Timon, this thy creature,
312	By night frequents my house. I am a man
313	That from my first have been inclined to thrift;
314	And my estate deserves an heir more raised
315	Than one which holds a trencher.
316	
317	TIMON	Well; what further?
318	
319	Old Athenian	One only daughter have I, no kin else,
320	On whom I may confer what I have got:
321	The maid is fair, o' the youngest for a bride,
322	And I have bred her at my dearest cost
323	In qualities of the best. This man of thine
324	Attempts her love: I prithee, noble lord,
325	Join with me to forbid him her resort;
326	Myself have spoke in vain.
327	
328	TIMON	The man is honest.
329	
330	Old Athenian	Therefore he will be, Timon:
331	His honesty rewards him in itself;
332	It must not bear my daughter.
333	
334	TIMON	Does she love him?
335	
336	Old Athenian	She is young and apt:
337	Our own precedent passions do instruct us
338	What levity's in youth.
339	
340	TIMON	[To LUCILIUS]           Love you the maid?
341	
342	LUCILIUS	Ay, my good lord, and she accepts of it.
343	
344	Old Athenian	If in her marriage my consent be missing,
345	I call the gods to witness, I will choose
346	Mine heir from forth the beggars of the world,
347	And dispossess her all.
348	
349	TIMON	How shall she be endow'd,
350	if she be mated with an equal husband?
351	
352	Old Athenian	Three talents on the present; in future, all.
353	
354	TIMON	This gentleman of mine hath served me long:
355	To build his fortune I will strain a little,
356	For 'tis a bond in men. Give him thy daughter:
357	What you bestow, in him I'll counterpoise,
358	And make him weigh with her.
359	
360	Old Athenian	Most noble lord,
361	Pawn me to this your honour, she is his.
362	
363	TIMON	My hand to thee; mine honour on my promise.
364	
365	LUCILIUS	Humbly I thank your lordship: never may
366	The state or fortune fall into my keeping,
367	Which is not owed to you!
368	
369	[Exeunt LUCILIUS and Old Athenian]
370	
371	Poet	Vouchsafe my labour, and long live your lordship!
372	
373	TIMON	I thank you; you shall hear from me anon:
374	Go not away. What have you there, my friend?
375	
376	Painter	A piece of painting, which I do beseech
377	Your lordship to accept.
378	
379	TIMON	Painting is welcome.
380	The painting is almost the natural man;
381	or since dishonour traffics with man's nature,
382	He is but outside: these pencill'd figures are
383	Even such as they give out. I like your work;
384	And you shall find I like it: wait attendance
385	Till you hear further from me.
386	
387	Painter	The gods preserve ye!
388	
389	TIMON	Well fare you, gentleman: give me your hand;
390	We must needs dine together. Sir, your jewel
391	Hath suffer'd under praise.
392	
393	Jeweller	What, my lord! dispraise?
394	
395	TIMON	A more satiety of commendations.
396	If I should pay you for't as 'tis extoll'd,
397	It would unclew me quite.
398	
399	Jeweller	My lord, 'tis rated
400	As those which sell would give: but you well know,
401	Things of like value differing in the owners
402	Are prized by their masters: believe't, dear lord,
403	You mend the jewel by the wearing it.
404	
405	TIMON	Well mock'd.
406	
407	Merchant	No, my good lord; he speaks the common tongue,
408	Which all men speak with him.
409	
410	TIMON	Look, who comes here: will you be chid?
411	
412	[Enter APEMANTUS]
413	
414	Jeweller: We'll bear, with your lordship.
415	
416	Merchant	He'll spare none.
417	
418	TIMON	Good morrow to thee, gentle Apemantus!
419	
420	APEMANTUS	Till I be gentle, stay thou for thy good morrow;
421	When thou art Timon's dog, and these knaves honest.
422	
423	TIMON	Why dost thou call them knaves? thou know'st them not.
424	
425	APEMANTUS	Are they not Athenians?
426	
427	TIMON	Yes.
428	
429	APEMANTUS	Then I repent not.
430	
431	Jeweller: You know me, Apemantus?
432	
433	APEMANTUS	Thou know'st I do: I call'd thee by thy name.
434	
435	TIMON	Thou art proud, Apemantus.
436	
437	APEMANTUS	Of nothing so much as that I am not like Timon.
438	
439	TIMON	Whither art going?
440	
441	APEMANTUS	To knock out an honest Athenian's brains.
442	
443	TIMON	That's a deed thou'lt die for.
444	
445	APEMANTUS	Right, if doing nothing be death by the law.
446	
447	TIMON	How likest thou this picture, Apemantus?
448	
449	APEMANTUS	The best, for the innocence.
450	
451	TIMON	Wrought he not well that painted it?
452	
453	APEMANTUS	He wrought better that made the painter; and yet
454	he's but a filthy piece of work.
455	
456	Painter	You're a dog.
457	
458	APEMANTUS	Thy mother's of my generation: what's she, if I be a dog?
459	
460	TIMON	Wilt dine with me, Apemantus?
461	
462	APEMANTUS	No; I eat not lords.
463	
464	TIMON	An thou shouldst, thou 'ldst anger ladies.
465	
466	APEMANTUS	O, they eat lords; so they come by great bellies.
467	
468	TIMON	That's a lascivious apprehension.
469	
470	APEMANTUS	So thou apprehendest it: take it for thy labour.
471	
472	TIMON	How dost thou like this jewel, Apemantus?
473	
474	APEMANTUS	Not so well as plain-dealing, which will not cost a
475	man a doit.
476	
477	TIMON	What dost thou think 'tis worth?
478	
479	APEMANTUS	Not worth my thinking. How now, poet!
480	
481	Poet	How now, philosopher!
482	
483	APEMANTUS	Thou liest.
484	
485	Poet	Art not one?
486	
487	APEMANTUS	Yes.
488	
489	Poet	Then I lie not.
490	
491	APEMANTUS	Art not a poet?
492	
493	Poet	Yes.
494	
495	APEMANTUS	Then thou liest: look in thy last work, where thou
496	hast feigned him a worthy fellow.
497	
498	Poet	That's not feigned; he is so.
499	
500	APEMANTUS	Yes, he is worthy of thee, and to pay thee for thy
501	labour: he that loves to be flattered is worthy o'
502	the flatterer. Heavens, that I were a lord!
503	
504	TIMON	What wouldst do then, Apemantus?
505	
506	APEMANTUS	E'en as Apemantus does now; hate a lord with my heart.
507	
508	TIMON	What, thyself?
509	
510	APEMANTUS	Ay.
511	
512	TIMON	Wherefore?
513	
514	APEMANTUS	That I had no angry wit to be a lord.
515	Art not thou a merchant?
516	
517	Merchant	Ay, Apemantus.
518	
519	APEMANTUS	Traffic confound thee, if the gods will not!
520	
521	Merchant	If traffic do it, the gods do it.
522	
523	APEMANTUS	Traffic's thy god; and thy god confound thee!
524	
525	[Trumpet sounds. Enter a Messenger]
526	
527	TIMON	What trumpet's that?
528	
529	Messenger	'Tis Alcibiades, and some twenty horse,
530	All of companionship.
531	
532	TIMON	Pray, entertain them; give them guide to us.
533	
534	[Exeunt some Attendants]
535	
536	You must needs dine with me: go not you hence
537	Till I have thank'd you: when dinner's done,
538	Show me this piece. I am joyful of your sights.
539	
540	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with the rest]
541	
542	Most welcome, sir!
543	
544	APEMANTUS	                  So, so, there!
545	Aches contract and starve your supple joints!
546	That there should be small love 'mongst these
547	sweet knaves,
548	And all this courtesy! The strain of man's bred out
549	Into baboon and monkey.
550	
551	ALCIBIADES	Sir, you have saved my longing, and I feed
552	Most hungerly on your sight.
553	
554	TIMON	Right welcome, sir!
555	Ere we depart, we'll share a bounteous time
556	In different pleasures. Pray you, let us in.
557	
558	[Exeunt all except APEMANTUS]
559	
560	[Enter two Lords]
561	
562	First Lord	What time o' day is't, Apemantus?
563	
564	APEMANTUS	Time to be honest.
565	
566	First Lord	That time serves still.
567	
568	APEMANTUS	The more accursed thou, that still omitt'st it.
569	
570	Second Lord	Thou art going to Lord Timon's feast?
571	
572	APEMANTUS	Ay, to see meat fill knaves and wine heat fools.
573	
574	Second Lord	Fare thee well, fare thee well.
575	
576	APEMANTUS	Thou art a fool to bid me farewell twice.
577	
578	Second Lord	Why, Apemantus?
579	
580	APEMANTUS	Shouldst have kept one to thyself, for I mean to
581	give thee none.
582	
583	First Lord	Hang thyself!
584	
585	APEMANTUS	No, I will do nothing at thy bidding: make thy
586	requests to thy friend.
587	
588	Second Lord	Away, unpeaceable dog, or I'll spurn thee hence!
589	
590	APEMANTUS	I will fly, like a dog, the heels o' the ass.
591	
592	[Exit]
593	
594	First Lord	He's opposite to humanity. Come, shall we in,
595	And taste Lord Timon's bounty? he outgoes
596	The very heart of kindness.
597	
598	Second Lord	He pours it out; Plutus, the god of gold,
599	Is but his steward: no meed, but he repays
600	Sevenfold above itself; no gift to him,
601	But breeds the giver a return exceeding
602	All use of quittance.
603	
604	First Lord	The noblest mind he carries
605	That ever govern'd man.
606	
607	Second Lord	Long may he live in fortunes! Shall we in?
608	
609	First Lord	I'll keep you company.
610	
611	[Exeunt]

622	
623	SCENE II	A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
624	
625	
626	[Hautboys playing loud music. A great banquet
627	served in; FLAVIUS and others attending; then enter
628	TIMON, ALCIBIADES, Lords, Senators, and VENTIDIUS.
629	Then comes, dropping, after all, APEMANTUS,
630	discontentedly, like himself]
631	
632	VENTIDIUS	Most honour'd Timon,
633	It hath pleased the gods to remember my father's age,
634	And call him to long peace.
635	He is gone happy, and has left me rich:
636	Then, as in grateful virtue I am bound
637	To your free heart, I do return those talents,
638	Doubled with thanks and service, from whose help
639	I derived liberty.
640	
641	TIMON	                  O, by no means,
642	Honest Ventidius; you mistake my love:
643	I gave it freely ever; and there's none
644	Can truly say he gives, if he receives:
645	If our betters play at that game, we must not dare
646	To imitate them; faults that are rich are fair.
647	
648	VENTIDIUS	A noble spirit!
649	
650	TIMON	                  Nay, my lords,
651	
652	[They all stand ceremoniously looking on TIMON]
653	
654	Ceremony was but devised at first
655	To set a gloss on faint deeds, hollow welcomes,
656	Recanting goodness, sorry ere 'tis shown;
657	But where there is true friendship, there needs none.
658	Pray, sit; more welcome are ye to my fortunes
659	Than my fortunes to me.
660	
661	[They sit]
662	
663	First Lord	My lord, we always have confess'd it.
664	
665	APEMANTUS	Ho, ho, confess'd it! hang'd it, have you not?
666	
667	TIMON	O, Apemantus, you are welcome.
668	
669	APEMANTUS	No;
670	You shall not make me welcome:
671	I come to have thee thrust me out of doors.
672	
673	TIMON	Fie, thou'rt a churl; ye've got a humour there
674	Does not become a man: 'tis much to blame.
675	They say, my lords, 'ira furor brevis est;' but yond
676	man is ever angry. Go, let him have a table by
677	himself, for he does neither affect company, nor is
678	he fit for't, indeed.
679	
680	APEMANTUS	Let me stay at thine apperil, Timon: I come to
681	observe; I give thee warning on't.
682	
683	TIMON	I take no heed of thee; thou'rt an Athenian,
684	therefore welcome: I myself would have no power;
685	prithee, let my meat make thee silent.
686	
687	APEMANTUS	I scorn thy meat; 'twould choke me, for I should
688	ne'er flatter thee. O you gods, what a number of
689	men eat Timon, and he sees 'em not! It grieves me
690	to see so many dip their meat in one man's blood;
691	and all the madness is, he cheers them up too.
692	I wonder men dare trust themselves with men:
693	Methinks they should invite them without knives;
694	Good for their meat, and safer for their lives.
695	There's much example for't; the fellow that sits
696	next him now, parts bread with him, pledges the
697	breath of him in a divided draught, is the readiest
698	man to kill him: 't has been proved. If I were a
699	huge man, I should fear to drink at meals;
700	Lest they should spy my windpipe's dangerous notes:
701	Great men should drink with harness on their throats.
702	
703	TIMON	My lord, in heart; and let the health go round.
704	
705	Second Lord	Let it flow this way, my good lord.
706	
707	APEMANTUS	Flow this way! A brave fellow! he keeps his tides
708	well. Those healths will make thee and thy state
709	look ill, Timon. Here's that which is too weak to
710	be a sinner, honest water, which ne'er left man i' the mire:
711	This and my food are equals; there's no odds:
712	Feasts are too proud to give thanks to the gods.
713	
714	Apemantus' grace.
715	
716	Immortal gods, I crave no pelf;
717	I pray for no man but myself:
718	Grant I may never prove so fond,
719	To trust man on his oath or bond;
720	Or a harlot, for her weeping;
721	Or a dog, that seems a-sleeping:
722	Or a keeper with my freedom;
723	Or my friends, if I should need 'em.
724	Amen. So fall to't:
725	Rich men sin, and I eat root.
726	
727	[Eats and drinks]
728	
729	Much good dich thy good heart, Apemantus!
730	
731	TIMON	Captain Alcibiades, your heart's in the field now.
732	
733	ALCIBIADES	My heart is ever at your service, my lord.
734	
735	TIMON	You had rather be at a breakfast of enemies than a
736	dinner of friends.
737	
738	ALCIBIADES	So the were bleeding-new, my lord, there's no meat
739	like 'em: I could wish my best friend at such a feast.
740	
741	APEMANTUS	Would all those fatterers were thine enemies then,
742	that then thou mightst kill 'em and bid me to 'em!
743	
744	First Lord	Might we but have that happiness, my lord, that you
745	would once use our hearts, whereby we might express
746	some part of our zeals, we should think ourselves
747	for ever perfect.
748	
749	TIMON	O, no doubt, my good friends, but the gods
750	themselves have provided that I shall have much help
751	from you: how had you been my friends else? why
752	have you that charitable title from thousands, did
753	not you chiefly belong to my heart? I have told
754	more of you to myself than you can with modesty
755	speak in your own behalf; and thus far I confirm
756	you. O you gods, think I, what need we have any
757	friends, if we should ne'er have need of 'em? they
758	were the most needless creatures living, should we
759	ne'er have use for 'em, and would most resemble
760	sweet instruments hung up in cases that keep their
761	sounds to themselves. Why, I have often wished
762	myself poorer, that I might come nearer to you. We
763	are born to do benefits: and what better or
764	properer can we can our own than the riches of our
765	friends? O, what a precious comfort 'tis, to have
766	so many, like brothers, commanding one another's
767	fortunes! O joy, e'en made away ere 't can be born!
768	Mine eyes cannot hold out water, methinks: to
769	forget their faults, I drink to you.
770	
771	APEMANTUS	Thou weepest to make them drink, Timon.
772	
773	Second Lord	Joy had the like conception in our eyes
774	And at that instant like a babe sprung up.
775	
776	APEMANTUS	Ho, ho! I laugh to think that babe a bastard.
777	
778	Third Lord	I promise you, my lord, you moved me much.
779	
780	APEMANTUS	Much!
781	
782	[Tucket, within]
783	
784	TIMON	What means that trump?
785	
786	[Enter a Servant]
787	
788	How now?
789	
790	Servant	Please you, my lord, there are certain
791	ladies most desirous of admittance.
792	
793	TIMON	Ladies! what are their wills?
794	
795	Servant	There comes with them a forerunner, my lord, which
796	bears that office, to signify their pleasures.
797	
798	TIMON	I pray, let them be admitted.
799	
800	[Enter Cupid]
801	
802	Cupid	Hail to thee, worthy Timon, and to all
803	That of his bounties taste! The five best senses
804	Acknowledge thee their patron; and come freely
805	To gratulate thy plenteous bosom: th' ear,
806	Taste, touch and smell, pleased from thy tale rise;
807	They only now come but to feast thine eyes.
808	
809	TIMON	They're welcome all; let 'em have kind admittance:
810	Music, make their welcome!
811	
812	[Exit Cupid]
813	
814	First Lord	You see, my lord, how ample you're beloved.
815	
816	[Music. Re-enter Cupid with a mask of Ladies
817	as Amazons, with lutes in their hands,
818	dancing and playing]
819	
820	APEMANTUS	Hoy-day, what a sweep of vanity comes this way!
821	They dance! they are mad women.
822	Like madness is the glory of this life.
823	As this pomp shows to a little oil and root.
824	We make ourselves fools, to disport ourselves;
825	And spend our flatteries, to drink those men
826	Upon whose age we void it up again,
827	With poisonous spite and envy.
828	Who lives that's not depraved or depraves?
829	Who dies, that bears not one spurn to their graves
830	Of their friends' gift?
831	I should fear those that dance before me now
832	Would one day stamp upon me: 't has been done;
833	Men shut their doors against a setting sun.
834	
835	[The Lords rise from table, with much adoring of
836	TIMON; and to show their loves, each singles out an
837	Amazon, and all dance, men with women, a lofty
838	strain or two to the hautboys, and cease]
839	
840	TIMON	You have done our pleasures much grace, fair ladies,
841	Set a fair fashion on our entertainment,
842	Which was not half so beautiful and kind;
843	You have added worth unto 't and lustre,
844	And entertain'd me with mine own device;
845	I am to thank you for 't.
846	
847	First Lady	My lord, you take us even at the best.
848	
849	APEMANTUS	'Faith, for the worst is filthy; and would not hold
850	taking, I doubt me.
851	
852	TIMON	Ladies, there is an idle banquet attends you:
853	Please you to dispose yourselves.
854	
855	All Ladies	Most thankfully, my lord.
856	
857	[Exeunt Cupid and Ladies]
858	
859	TIMON	Flavius.
860	
861	FLAVIUS	My lord?
862	
863	TIMON	       The little casket bring me hither.
864	
865	FLAVIUS	Yes, my lord. More jewels yet!
866	There is no crossing him in 's humour;
867	
868	[Aside]
869	
870	Else I should tell him,--well, i' faith I should,
871	When all's spent, he 'ld be cross'd then, an he could.
872	'Tis pity bounty had not eyes behind,
873	That man might ne'er be wretched for his mind.
874	
875	[Exit]
876	
877	First Lord	Where be our men?
878	
879	Servant	Here, my lord, in readiness.
880	
881	Second Lord	Our horses!
882	
883	[Re-enter FLAVIUS, with the casket]
884	
885	TIMON	          O my friends,
886	I have one word to say to you: look you, my good lord,
887	I must entreat you, honour me so much
888	As to advance this jewel; accept it and wear it,
889	Kind my lord.
890	
891	First Lord	I am so far already in your gifts,--
892	
893	All	So are we all.
894	
895	[Enter a Servant]
896	
897	Servant	My lord, there are certain nobles of the senate
898	Newly alighted, and come to visit you.
899	
900	TIMON	They are fairly welcome.
901	
902	FLAVIUS	I beseech your honour,
903	Vouchsafe me a word; it does concern you near.
904	
905	TIMON	Near! why then, another time I'll hear thee:
906	I prithee, let's be provided to show them
907	entertainment.
908	
909	FLAVIUS	[Aside]  I scarce know how.
910	
911	[Enter a Second Servant]
912	
913	Second Servant	May it please your honour, Lord Lucius,
914	Out of his free love, hath presented to you
915	Four milk-white horses, trapp'd in silver.
916	
917	TIMON	I shall accept them fairly; let the presents
918	Be worthily entertain'd.
919	
920	[Enter a third Servant]
921	
922	How now! what news?
923	
924	Third Servant	Please you, my lord, that honourable
925	gentleman, Lord Lucullus, entreats your company
926	to-morrow to hunt with him, and has sent your honour
927	two brace of greyhounds.
928	
929	TIMON	I'll hunt with him; and let them be received,
930	Not without fair reward.
931	
932	FLAVIUS	[Aside]                What will this come to?
933	He commands us to provide, and give great gifts,
934	And all out of an empty coffer:
935	Nor will he know his purse, or yield me this,
936	To show him what a beggar his heart is,
937	Being of no power to make his wishes good:
938	His promises fly so beyond his state
939	That what he speaks is all in debt; he owes
940	For every word: he is so kind that he now
941	Pays interest for 't; his land's put to their books.
942	Well, would I were gently put out of office
943	Before I were forced out!
944	Happier is he that has no friend to feed
945	Than such that do e'en enemies exceed.
946	I bleed inwardly for my lord.
947	
948	[Exit]
949	
950	TIMON	You do yourselves
951	Much wrong, you bate too much of your own merits:
952	Here, my lord, a trifle of our love.
953	
954	Second Lord	With more than common thanks I will receive it.
955	
956	Third Lord	O, he's the very soul of bounty!
957	
958	TIMON	And now I remember, my lord, you gave
959	Good words the other day of a bay courser
960	I rode on: it is yours, because you liked it.
961	
962	Second Lord	O, I beseech you, pardon me, my lord, in that.
963	
964	TIMON	You may take my word, my lord; I know, no man
965	Can justly praise but what he does affect:
966	I weigh my friend's affection with mine own;
967	I'll tell you true. I'll call to you.
968	
969	All Lords	O, none so welcome.
970	
971	TIMON	I take all and your several visitations
972	So kind to heart, 'tis not enough to give;
973	Methinks, I could deal kingdoms to my friends,
974	And ne'er be weary. Alcibiades,
975	Thou art a soldier, therefore seldom rich;
976	It comes in charity to thee: for all thy living
977	Is 'mongst the dead, and all the lands thou hast
978	Lie in a pitch'd field.
979	
980	ALCIBIADES	Ay, defiled land, my lord.
981	
982	First Lord	We are so virtuously bound--
983	
984	TIMON	And so
985	Am I to you.
986	
987	Second Lord	So infinitely endear'd--
988	
989	TIMON	All to you. Lights, more lights!
990	
991	First Lord	The best of happiness,
992	Honour and fortunes, keep with you, Lord Timon!
993	
994	TIMON	Ready for his friends.
995	
996	[Exeunt all but APEMANTUS and TIMON]
997	
998	APEMANTUS	What a coil's here!
999	Serving of becks and jutting-out of bums!
1000	I doubt whether their legs be worth the sums
1001	That are given for 'em. Friendship's full of dregs:
1002	Methinks, false hearts should never have sound legs,
1003	Thus honest fools lay out their wealth on court'sies.
1004	
1005	TIMON	Now, Apemantus, if thou wert not sullen, I would be
1006	good to thee.
1007	
1008	APEMANTUS	No, I'll nothing: for if I should be bribed too,
1009	there would be none left to rail upon thee, and then
1010	thou wouldst sin the faster. Thou givest so long,
1011	Timon, I fear me thou wilt give away thyself in
1012	paper shortly: what need these feasts, pomps and
1013	vain-glories?
1014	
1015	TIMON	Nay, an you begin to rail on society once, I am
1016	sworn not to give regard to you. Farewell; and come
1017	with better music.
1018	
1019	[Exit]
1020	
1021	APEMANTUS	So:
1022	Thou wilt not hear me now; thou shalt not then:
1023	I'll lock thy heaven from thee.
1024	O, that men's ears should be
1025	To counsel deaf, but not to flattery!
1026

1035	ACT II
1036	
1037	
1038	
1039	SCENE I	A Senator's house.
1040	
1041	
1042	[Enter Senator, with papers in his hand]
1043	
1044	Senator	And late, five thousand: to Varro and to Isidore
1045	He owes nine thousand; besides my former sum,
1046	Which makes it five and twenty. Still in motion
1047	Of raging waste? It cannot hold; it will not.
1048	If I want gold, steal but a beggar's dog,
1049	And give it Timon, why, the dog coins gold.
1050	If I would sell my horse, and buy twenty more
1051	Better than he, why, give my horse to Timon,
1052	Ask nothing, give it him, it foals me, straight,
1053	And able horses. No porter at his gate,
1054	But rather one that smiles and still invites
1055	All that pass by. It cannot hold: no reason
1056	Can found his state in safety. Caphis, ho!
1057	Caphis, I say!
1058	
1059	[Enter CAPHIS]
1060	
1061	CAPHIS	Here, sir; what is your pleasure?
1062	
1063	Senator	Get on your cloak, and haste you to Lord Timon;
1064	Importune him for my moneys; be not ceased
1065	With slight denial, nor then silenced when--
1066	'Commend me to your master'--and the cap
1067	Plays in the right hand, thus: but tell him,
1068	My uses cry to me, I must serve my turn
1069	Out of mine own; his days and times are past
1070	And my reliances on his fracted dates
1071	Have smit my credit: I love and honour him,
1072	But must not break my back to heal his finger;
1073	Immediate are my needs, and my relief
1074	Must not be toss'd and turn'd to me in words,
1075	But find supply immediate. Get you gone:
1076	Put on a most importunate aspect,
1077	A visage of demand; for, I do fear,
1078	When every feather sticks in his own wing,
1079	Lord Timon will be left a naked gull,
1080	Which flashes now a phoenix. Get you gone.
1081	
1082	CAPHIS	I go, sir.
1083	
1084	Senator	'I go, sir!'--Take the bonds along with you,
1085	And have the dates in contempt.
1086	
1087	CAPHIS	I will, sir.
1088	
1089	Senator	Go.

1101	
1102	
1103	SCENE II	The same. A hall in Timon's house.
1104	
1105	
1106	[Enter FLAVIUS, with many bills in his hand]
1107	
1108	FLAVIUS	No care, no stop! so senseless of expense,
1109	That he will neither know how to maintain it,
1110	Nor cease his flow of riot: takes no account
1111	How things go from him, nor resumes no care
1112	Of what is to continue: never mind
1113	Was to be so unwise, to be so kind.
1114	What shall be done? he will not hear, till feel:
1115	I must be round with him, now he comes from hunting.
1116	Fie, fie, fie, fie!
1117	
1118	[Enter CAPHIS, and the Servants of Isidore and Varro]
1119	
1120	CAPHIS	Good even, Varro: what,
1121	You come for money?
1122	
1123	Varro's Servant	Is't not your business too?
1124	
1125	CAPHIS	It is: and yours too, Isidore?
1126	
1127	Isidore's Servant	It is so.
1128	
1129	CAPHIS	Would we were all discharged!
1130	
1131	Varro's Servant	I fear it.
1132	
1133	CAPHIS	Here comes the lord.
1134	
1135	[Enter TIMON, ALCIBIADES, and Lords, &c]
1136	
1137	TIMON	So soon as dinner's done, we'll forth again,
1138	My Alcibiades. With me? what is your will?
1139	
1140	CAPHIS	My lord, here is a note of certain dues.
1141	
1142	TIMON	Dues! Whence are you?
1143	
1144	CAPHIS	Of Athens here, my lord.
1145	
1146	TIMON	Go to my steward.
1147	
1148	CAPHIS	Please it your lordship, he hath put me off
1149	To the succession of new days this month:
1150	My master is awaked by great occasion
1151	To call upon his own, and humbly prays you
1152	That with your other noble parts you'll suit
1153	In giving him his right.
1154	
1155	TIMON	Mine honest friend,
1156	I prithee, but repair to me next morning.
1157	
1158	CAPHIS	Nay, good my lord,--
1159	
1160	TIMON	Contain thyself, good friend.
1161	
1162	Varro's Servant	One Varro's servant, my good lord,--
1163	
1164	Isidore's Servant	From Isidore;
1165	He humbly prays your speedy payment.
1166	
1167	CAPHIS	If you did know, my lord, my master's wants--
1168	
1169	Varro's Servant	'Twas due on forfeiture, my lord, six weeks And past.
1170	
1171	Isidore's Servant	         Your steward puts me off, my lord;
1172	And I am sent expressly to your lordship.
1173	
1174	TIMON	Give me breath.
1175	I do beseech you, good my lords, keep on;
1176	I'll wait upon you instantly.
1177	
1178	[Exeunt ALCIBIADES and Lords]
1179	
1180	[To FLAVIUS]
1181	
1182	Come hither: pray you,
1183	How goes the world, that I am thus encounter'd
1184	With clamourous demands of date-broke bonds,
1185	And the detention of long-since-due debts,
1186	Against my honour?
1187	
1188	FLAVIUS	                  Please you, gentlemen,
1189	The time is unagreeable to this business:
1190	Your importunacy cease till after dinner,
1191	That I may make his lordship understand
1192	Wherefore you are not paid.
1193	
1194	TIMON	Do so, my friends. See them well entertain'd.
1195	
1196	[Exit]
1197	
1198	FLAVIUS	Pray, draw near.
1199	
1200	[Exit]
1201	
1202	[Enter APEMANTUS and Fool]
1203	
1204	CAPHIS	Stay, stay, here comes the fool with Apemantus:
1205	let's ha' some sport with 'em.
1206	
1207	Varro's Servant	Hang him, he'll abuse us.
1208	
1209	Isidore's Servant	A plague upon him, dog!
1210	
1211	Varro's Servant	How dost, fool?
1212	
1213	APEMANTUS	Dost dialogue with thy shadow?
1214	
1215	Varro's Servant	I speak not to thee.
1216	
1217	APEMANTUS	No,'tis to thyself.
1218	
1219	[To the Fool]
1220	
1221	Come away.
1222	
1223	Isidore's Servant	There's the fool hangs on your back already.
1224	
1225	APEMANTUS	No, thou stand'st single, thou'rt not on him yet.
1226	
1227	CAPHIS	Where's the fool now?
1228	
1229	APEMANTUS	He last asked the question. Poor rogues, and
1230	usurers' men! bawds between gold and want!
1231	
1232	All Servants	What are we, Apemantus?
1233	
1234	APEMANTUS	Asses.
1235	
1236	All Servants	Why?
1237	
1238	APEMANTUS	That you ask me what you are, and do not know
1239	yourselves. Speak to 'em, fool.
1240	
1241	Fool	How do you, gentlemen?
1242	
1243	All Servants	Gramercies, good fool: how does your mistress?
1244	
1245	Fool	She's e'en setting on water to scald such chickens
1246	as you are. Would we could see you at Corinth!
1247	
1248	APEMANTUS	Good! gramercy.
1249	
1250	[Enter Page]
1251	
1252	Fool	Look you, here comes my mistress' page.
1253	
1254	Page	[To the Fool]  Why, how now, captain! what do you
1255	in this wise company? How dost thou, Apemantus?
1256	
1257	APEMANTUS	Would I had a rod in my mouth, that I might answer
1258	thee profitably.
1259	
1260	Page	Prithee, Apemantus, read me the superscription of
1261	these letters: I know not which is which.
1262	
1263	APEMANTUS	Canst not read?
1264	
1265	Page	No.
1266	
1267	APEMANTUS	There will little learning die then, that day thou
1268	art hanged. This is to Lord Timon; this to
1269	Alcibiades. Go; thou wast born a bastard, and thou't
1270	die a bawd.
1271	
1272	Page	Thou wast whelped a dog, and thou shalt famish a
1273	dog's death. Answer not; I am gone.
1274	
1275	[Exit]
1276	
1277	APEMANTUS	E'en so thou outrunnest grace. Fool, I will go with
1278	you to Lord Timon's.
1279	
1280	Fool	Will you leave me there?
1281	
1282	APEMANTUS	If Timon stay at home. You three serve three usurers?
1283	
1284	All Servants	Ay; would they served us!
1285	
1286	APEMANTUS	So would I,--as good a trick as ever hangman served thief.
1287	
1288	Fool	Are you three usurers' men?
1289	
1290	All Servants	Ay, fool.
1291	
1292	Fool	I think no usurer but has a fool to his servant: my
1293	mistress is one, and I am her fool. When men come
1294	to borrow of your masters, they approach sadly, and
1295	go away merry; but they enter my mistress' house
1296	merrily, and go away sadly: the reason of this?
1297	
1298	Varro's Servant	I could render one.
1299	
1300	APEMANTUS	Do it then, that we may account thee a whoremaster
1301	and a knave; which not-withstanding, thou shalt be
1302	no less esteemed.
1303	
1304	Varro's Servant	What is a whoremaster, fool?
1305	
1306	Fool	A fool in good clothes, and something like thee.
1307	'Tis a spirit: sometime't appears like a lord;
1308	sometime like a lawyer; sometime like a philosopher,
1309	with two stones moe than's artificial one: he is
1310	very often like a knight; and, generally, in all
1311	shapes that man goes up and down in from fourscore
1312	to thirteen, this spirit walks in.
1313	
1314	Varro's Servant	Thou art not altogether a fool.
1315	
1316	Fool	Nor thou altogether a wise man: as much foolery as
1317	I have, so much wit thou lackest.
1318	
1319	APEMANTUS	That answer might have become Apemantus.
1320	
1321	All Servants	Aside, aside; here comes Lord Timon.
1322	
1323	[Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS]
1324	
1325	APEMANTUS	Come with me, fool, come.
1326	
1327	Fool	I do not always follow lover, elder brother and
1328	woman; sometime the philosopher.
1329	
1330	[Exeunt APEMANTUS and Fool]
1331	
1332	FLAVIUS	Pray you, walk near: I'll speak with you anon.
1333	
1334	[Exeunt Servants]
1335	
1336	TIMON	You make me marvel: wherefore ere this time
1337	Had you not fully laid my state before me,
1338	That I might so have rated my expense,
1339	As I had leave of means?
1340	
1341	FLAVIUS	You would not hear me,
1342	At many leisures I proposed.
1343	
1344	TIMON	Go to:
1345	Perchance some single vantages you took.
1346	When my indisposition put you back:
1347	And that unaptness made your minister,
1348	Thus to excuse yourself.
1349	
1350	FLAVIUS	O my good lord,
1351	At many times I brought in my accounts,
1352	Laid them before you; you would throw them off,
1353	And say, you found them in mine honesty.
1354	When, for some trifling present, you have bid me
1355	Return so much, I have shook my head and wept;
1356	Yea, 'gainst the authority of manners, pray'd you
1357	To hold your hand more close: I did endure
1358	Not seldom, nor no slight cheques, when I have
1359	Prompted you in the ebb of your estate
1360	And your great flow of debts. My loved lord,
1361	Though you hear now, too late--yet now's a time--
1362	The greatest of your having lacks a half
1363	To pay your present debts.
1364	
1365	TIMON	Let all my land be sold.
1366	
1367	FLAVIUS	'Tis all engaged, some forfeited and gone;
1368	And what remains will hardly stop the mouth
1369	Of present dues: the future comes apace:
1370	What shall defend the interim? and at length
1371	How goes our reckoning?
1372	
1373	TIMON	To Lacedaemon did my land extend.
1374	
1375	FLAVIUS	O my good lord, the world is but a word:
1376	Were it all yours to give it in a breath,
1377	How quickly were it gone!
1378	
1379	TIMON	You tell me true.
1380	
1381	FLAVIUS	If you suspect my husbandry or falsehood,
1382	Call me before the exactest auditors
1383	And set me on the proof. So the gods bless me,
1384	When all our offices have been oppress'd
1385	With riotous feeders, when our vaults have wept
1386	With drunken spilth of wine, when every room
1387	Hath blazed with lights and bray'd with minstrelsy,
1388	I have retired me to a wasteful cock,
1389	And set mine eyes at flow.
1390	
1391	TIMON	Prithee, no more.
1392	
1393	FLAVIUS	Heavens, have I said, the bounty of this lord!
1394	How many prodigal bits have slaves and peasants
1395	This night englutted! Who is not Timon's?
1396	What heart, head, sword, force, means, but is
1397	Lord Timon's?
1398	Great Timon, noble, worthy, royal Timon!
1399	Ah, when the means are gone that buy this praise,
1400	The breath is gone whereof this praise is made:
1401	Feast-won, fast-lost; one cloud of winter showers,
1402	These flies are couch'd.
1403	
1404	TIMON	Come, sermon me no further:
1405	No villanous bounty yet hath pass'd my heart;
1406	Unwisely, not ignobly, have I given.
1407	Why dost thou weep? Canst thou the conscience lack,
1408	To think I shall lack friends? Secure thy heart;
1409	If I would broach the vessels of my love,
1410	And try the argument of hearts by borrowing,
1411	Men and men's fortunes could I frankly use
1412	As I can bid thee speak.
1413	
1414	FLAVIUS	Assurance bless your thoughts!
1415	
1416	TIMON	And, in some sort, these wants of mine are crown'd,
1417	That I account them blessings; for by these
1418	Shall I try friends: you shall perceive how you
1419	Mistake my fortunes; I am wealthy in my friends.
1420	Within there! Flaminius! Servilius!
1421	
1422	[Enter FLAMINIUS, SERVILIUS, and other Servants]
1423	
1424	Servants	My lord? my lord?
1425	
1426	TIMON	I will dispatch you severally; you to Lord Lucius;
1427	to Lord Lucullus you: I hunted with his honour
1428	to-day: you, to Sempronius: commend me to their
1429	loves, and, I am proud, say, that my occasions have
1430	found time to use 'em toward a supply of money: let
1431	the request be fifty talents.
1432	
1433	FLAMINIUS	As you have said, my lord.
1434	
1435	FLAVIUS	[Aside]  Lord Lucius and Lucullus? hum!
1436	
1437	TIMON	Go you, sir, to the senators--
1438	Of whom, even to the state's best health, I have
1439	Deserved this hearing--bid 'em send o' the instant
1440	A thousand talents to me.
1441	
1442	FLAVIUS	I have been bold--
1443	For that I knew it the most general way--
1444	To them to use your signet and your name;
1445	But they do shake their heads, and I am here
1446	No richer in return.
1447	
1448	TIMON	Is't true? can't be?
1449	
1450	FLAVIUS	They answer, in a joint and corporate voice,
1451	That now they are at fall, want treasure, cannot
1452	Do what they would; are sorry--you are honourable,--
1453	But yet they could have wish'd--they know not--
1454	Something hath been amiss--a noble nature
1455	May catch a wrench--would all were well--'tis pity;--
1456	And so, intending other serious matters,
1457	After distasteful looks and these hard fractions,
1458	With certain half-caps and cold-moving nods
1459	They froze me into silence.
1460	
1461	TIMON	You gods, reward them!
1462	Prithee, man, look cheerly. These old fellows
1463	Have their ingratitude in them hereditary:
1464	Their blood is caked, 'tis cold, it seldom flows;
1465	'Tis lack of kindly warmth they are not kind;
1466	And nature, as it grows again toward earth,
1467	Is fashion'd for the journey, dull and heavy.
1468	
1469	[To a Servant]
1470	
1471	Go to Ventidius.
1472	
1473	[To FLAVIUS]
1474	
1475	Prithee, be not sad,
1476	Thou art true and honest; ingeniously I speak.
1477	No blame belongs to thee.
1478	
1479	[To Servant]
1480	
1481	Ventidius lately
1482	Buried his father; by whose death he's stepp'd
1483	Into a great estate: when he was poor,
1484	Imprison'd and in scarcity of friends,
1485	I clear'd him with five talents: greet him from me;
1486	Bid him suppose some good necessity
1487	Touches his friend, which craves to be remember'd
1488	With those five talents.
1489	
1490	[Exit Servant]
1491	
1492	[To FLAVIUS]
1493	
1494	That had, give't these fellows
1495	To whom 'tis instant due. Ne'er speak, or think,
1496	That Timon's fortunes 'mong his friends can sink.
1497	
1498	FLAVIUS	I would I could not think it: that thought is
1499	bounty's foe;
1500	Being free itself, it thinks all others so.
1501

1513	
1514	SCENE I	A room in Lucullus' house.
1515	
1516	
1517	[FLAMINIUS waiting. Enter a Servant to him]
1518	
1519	Servant	I have told my lord of you; he is coming down to you.
1520	
1521	FLAMINIUS	I thank you, sir.
1522	
1523	[Enter LUCULLUS]
1524	
1525	Servant	Here's my lord.
1526	
1527	LUCULLUS	[Aside]  One of Lord Timon's men? a gift, I
1528	warrant. Why, this hits right; I dreamt of a silver
1529	basin and ewer to-night. Flaminius, honest
1530	Flaminius; you are very respectively welcome, sir.
1531	Fill me some wine.
1532	
1533	[Exit Servants]
1534	
1535	And how does that honourable, complete, free-hearted
1536	gentleman of Athens, thy very bountiful good lord
1537	and master?
1538	
1539	FLAMINIUS	His health is well sir.
1540	
1541	LUCULLUS	I am right glad that his health is well, sir: and
1542	what hast thou there under thy cloak, pretty Flaminius?
1543	
1544	FLAMINIUS	'Faith, nothing but an empty box, sir; which, in my
1545	lord's behalf, I come to entreat your honour to
1546	supply; who, having great and instant occasion to
1547	use fifty talents, hath sent to your lordship to
1548	furnish him, nothing doubting your present
1549	assistance therein.
1550	
1551	LUCULLUS	La, la, la, la! 'nothing doubting,' says he? Alas,
1552	good lord! a noble gentleman 'tis, if he would not
1553	keep so good a house. Many a time and often I ha'
1554	dined with him, and told him on't, and come again to
1555	supper to him, of purpose to have him spend less,
1556	and yet he would embrace no counsel, take no warning
1557	by my coming. Every man has his fault, and honesty
1558	is his: I ha' told him on't, but I could ne'er get
1559	him from't.
1560	
1561	[Re-enter Servant, with wine]
1562	
1563	Servant	Please your lordship, here is the wine.
1564	
1565	LUCULLUS	Flaminius, I have noted thee always wise. Here's to thee.
1566	
1567	FLAMINIUS	Your lordship speaks your pleasure.
1568	
1569	LUCULLUS	I have observed thee always for a towardly prompt
1570	spirit--give thee thy due--and one that knows what
1571	belongs to reason; and canst use the time well, if
1572	the time use thee well: good parts in thee.
1573	
1574	[To Servant]
1575	
1576	Get you gone, sirrah.
1577	
1578	[Exit Servant]
1579	
1580	Draw nearer, honest Flaminius. Thy lord's a
1581	bountiful gentleman: but thou art wise; and thou
1582	knowest well enough, although thou comest to me,
1583	that this is no time to lend money, especially upon
1584	bare friendship, without security. Here's three
1585	solidares for thee: good boy, wink at me, and say
1586	thou sawest me not. Fare thee well.
1587	
1588	FLAMINIUS	Is't possible the world should so much differ,
1589	And we alive that lived? Fly, damned baseness,
1590	To him that worships thee!
1591	
1592	[Throwing the money back]
1593	
1594	LUCULLUS	Ha! now I see thou art a fool, and fit for thy master.
1595	
1596	[Exit]
1597	
1598	FLAMINIUS	May these add to the number that may scald thee!
1599	Let moulten coin be thy damnation,
1600	Thou disease of a friend, and not himself!
1601	Has friendship such a faint and milky heart,
1602	It turns in less than two nights? O you gods,
1603	I feel master's passion! this slave,
1604	Unto his honour, has my lord's meat in him:
1605	Why should it thrive and turn to nutriment,
1606	When he is turn'd to poison?
1607	O, may diseases only work upon't!
1608	And, when he's sick to death, let not that part of nature
1609	Which my lord paid for, be of any power
1610	To expel sickness, but prolong his hour!

1618	
1619	
1620	ACT III
1621	
1622	
1623	
1624	SCENE II	A public place.
1625	
1626	
1627	[Enter LUCILIUS, with three Strangers]
1628	
1629	LUCILIUS	Who, the Lord Timon? he is my very good friend, and
1630	an honourable gentleman.
1631	
1632	First Stranger	We know him for no less, though we are but strangers
1633	to him. But I can tell you one thing, my lord, and
1634	which I hear from common rumours: now Lord Timon's
1635	happy hours are done and past, and his estate
1636	shrinks from him.
1637	
1638	LUCILIUS	Fie, no, do not believe it; he cannot want for money.
1639	
1640	Second Stranger	But believe you this, my lord, that, not long ago,
1641	one of his men was with the Lord Lucullus to borrow
1642	so many talents, nay, urged extremely for't and
1643	showed what necessity belonged to't, and yet was denied.
1644	
1645	LUCILIUS	How!
1646	
1647	Second Stranger	I tell you, denied, my lord.
1648	
1649	LUCILIUS	What a strange case was that! now, before the gods,
1650	I am ashamed on't. Denied that honourable man!
1651	there was very little honour showed in't. For my own
1652	part, I must needs confess, I have received some
1653	small kindnesses from him, as money, plate, jewels
1654	and such-like trifles, nothing comparing to his;
1655	yet, had he mistook him and sent to me, I should
1656	ne'er have denied his occasion so many talents.
1657	
1658	[Enter SERVILIUS]
1659	
1660	SERVILIUS	See, by good hap, yonder's my lord;
1661	I have sweat to see his honour. My honoured lord,--
1662	
1663	[To LUCIUS]
1664	
1665	LUCILIUS	Servilius! you are kindly met, sir. Fare thee well:
1666	commend me to thy honourable virtuous lord, my very
1667	exquisite friend.
1668	
1669	SERVILIUS	May it please your honour, my lord hath sent--
1670	
1671	LUCILIUS	Ha! what has he sent? I am so much endeared to
1672	that lord; he's ever sending: how shall I thank
1673	him, thinkest thou? And what has he sent now?
1674	
1675	SERVILIUS	Has only sent his present occasion now, my lord;
1676	requesting your lordship to supply his instant use
1677	with so many talents.
1678	
1679	LUCILIUS	I know his lordship is but merry with me;
1680	He cannot want fifty five hundred talents.
1681	
1682	SERVILIUS	But in the mean time he wants less, my lord.
1683	If his occasion were not virtuous,
1684	I should not urge it half so faithfully.
1685	
1686	LUCILIUS	Dost thou speak seriously, Servilius?
1687	
1688	SERVILIUS	Upon my soul,'tis true, sir.
1689	
1690	LUCILIUS	What a wicked beast was I to disfurnish myself
1691	against such a good time, when I might ha' shown
1692	myself honourable! how unluckily it happened, that I
1693	should purchase the day before for a little part,
1694	and undo a great deal of honoured! Servilius, now,
1695	before the gods, I am not able to do,--the more
1696	beast, I say:--I was sending to use Lord Timon
1697	myself, these gentlemen can witness! but I would
1698	not, for the wealth of Athens, I had done't now.
1699	Commend me bountifully to his good lordship; and I
1700	hope his honour will conceive the fairest of me,
1701	because I have no power to be kind: and tell him
1702	this from me, I count it one of my greatest
1703	afflictions, say, that I cannot pleasure such an
1704	honourable gentleman. Good Servilius, will you
1705	befriend me so far, as to use mine own words to him?
1706	
1707	SERVILIUS	Yes, sir, I shall.
1708	
1709	LUCILIUS	I'll look you out a good turn, Servilius.
1710	
1711	[Exit SERVILIUS]
1712	
1713	True as you said, Timon is shrunk indeed;
1714	And he that's once denied will hardly speed.
1715	
1716	[Exit]
1717	
1718	First Stranger	Do you observe this, Hostilius?
1719	
1720	Second Stranger	Ay, too well.
1721	
1722	First Stranger	Why, this is the world's soul; and just of the
1723	same piece
1724	Is every flatterer's spirit. Who can call him
1725	His friend that dips in the same dish? for, in
1726	My knowing, Timon has been this lord's father,
1727	And kept his credit with his purse,
1728	Supported his estate; nay, Timon's money
1729	Has paid his men their wages: he ne'er drinks,
1730	But Timon's silver treads upon his lip;
1731	And yet--O, see the monstrousness of man
1732	When he looks out in an ungrateful shape!--
1733	He does deny him, in respect of his,
1734	What charitable men afford to beggars.
1735	
1736	Third Stranger	Religion groans at it.
1737	
1738	First Stranger	For mine own part,
1739	I never tasted Timon in my life,
1740	Nor came any of his bounties over me,
1741	To mark me for his friend; yet, I protest,
1742	For his right noble mind, illustrious virtue
1743	And honourable carriage,
1744	Had his necessity made use of me,
1745	I would have put my wealth into donation,
1746	And the best half should have return'd to him,
1747	So much I love his heart: but, I perceive,
1748	Men must learn now with pity to dispense;
1749	For policy sits above conscience.
1750	
1751	[Exeunt]

1756	TIMON OF ATHENS
1757	
1758	
1759	ACT III
1760	
1761	
1762	
1763	SCENE III	A room in Sempronius' house.
1764	
1765	
1766	[Enter SEMPRONIUS, and a Servant of TIMON's]
1767	
1768	SEMPRONIUS	Must he needs trouble me in 't,--hum!--'bove
1769	all others?
1770	He might have tried Lord Lucius or Lucullus;
1771	And now Ventidius is wealthy too,
1772	Whom he redeem'd from prison: all these
1773	Owe their estates unto him.
1774	
1775	Servant	My lord,
1776	They have all been touch'd and found base metal, for
1777	They have au denied him.
1778	
1779	SEMPRONIUS	How! have they denied him?
1780	Has Ventidius and Lucullus denied him?
1781	And does he send to me? Three? hum!
1782	It shows but little love or judgment in him:
1783	Must I be his last refuge! His friends, like
1784	physicians,
1785	Thrive, give him over: must I take the cure upon me?
1786	Has much disgraced me in't; I'm angry at him,
1787	That might have known my place: I see no sense for't,
1788	But his occasion might have woo'd me first;
1789	For, in my conscience, I was the first man
1790	That e'er received gift from him:
1791	And does he think so backwardly of me now,
1792	That I'll requite its last? No:
1793	So it may prove an argument of laughter
1794	To the rest, and 'mongst lords I be thought a fool.
1795	I'ld rather than the worth of thrice the sum,
1796	Had sent to me first, but for my mind's sake;
1797	I'd such a courage to do him good. But now return,
1798	And with their faint reply this answer join;
1799	Who bates mine honour shall not know my coin.
1800	
1801	[Exit]
1802	
1803	Servant	Excellent! Your lordship's a goodly villain. The
1804	devil knew not what he did when he made man
1805	politic; he crossed himself by 't: and I cannot
1806	think but, in the end, the villainies of man will
1807	set him clear. How fairly this lord strives to
1808	appear foul! takes virtuous copies to be wicked,
1809	like those that under hot ardent zeal would set
1810	whole realms on fire: Of such a nature is his
1811	politic love.
1812	This was my lord's best hope; now all are fled,
1813	Save only the gods: now his friends are dead,
1814	Doors, that were ne'er acquainted with their wards
1815	Many a bounteous year must be employ'd
1816	Now to guard sure their master.
1817	And this is all a liberal course allows;
1818	Who cannot keep his wealth must keep his house.

1825	TIMON OF ATHENS
1826	
1827	
1828	ACT III
1829	
1830	
1831	
1832	SCENE IV	The same. A hall in Timon's house.
1833	
1834	
1835	[Enter two Servants of Varro, and the Servant of
1836	LUCIUS, meeting TITUS, HORTENSIUS, and other
1837	Servants of TIMON's creditors, waiting his coming out]
1838	
1839	Varro's
1840	First Servant	Well met; good morrow, Titus and Hortensius.
1841	
1842	TITUS	The like to you kind Varro.
1843	
1844	HORTENSIUS	Lucius!
1845	What, do we meet together?
1846	
1847	Lucilius' Servant	Ay, and I think
1848	One business does command us all; for mine Is money.
1849	
1850	TITUS	So is theirs and ours.
1851	
1852	[Enter PHILOTUS]
1853	
1854	Lucilius' Servant	And Sir Philotus too!
1855	
1856	PHILOTUS	Good day at once.
1857	
1858	Lucilius' Servant	                  Welcome, good brother.
1859	What do you think the hour?
1860	
1861	PHILOTUS	Labouring for nine.
1862	
1863	Lucilius' Servant	So much?
1864	
1865	PHILOTUS	Is not my lord seen yet?
1866	
1867	Lucilius' Servant	Not yet.
1868	
1869	PHILOTUS	I wonder on't; he was wont to shine at seven.
1870	
1871	Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but the days are wax'd shorter with him:
1872	You must consider that a prodigal course
1873	Is like the sun's; but not, like his, recoverable.
1874	I fear 'tis deepest winter in Lord Timon's purse;
1875	That is one may reach deep enough, and yet
1876	Find little.
1877	
1878	PHILOTUS	I am of your fear for that.
1879	
1880	TITUS	I'll show you how to observe a strange event.
1881	Your lord sends now for money.
1882	
1883	HORTENSIUS	Most true, he does.
1884	
1885	TITUS	And he wears jewels now of Timon's gift,
1886	For which I wait for money.
1887	
1888	HORTENSIUS	It is against my heart.
1889	
1890	Lucilius' Servant	Mark, how strange it shows,
1891	Timon in this should pay more than he owes:
1892	And e'en as if your lord should wear rich jewels,
1893	And send for money for 'em.
1894	
1895	HORTENSIUS	I'm weary of this charge, the gods can witness:
1896	I know my lord hath spent of Timon's wealth,
1897	And now ingratitude makes it worse than stealth.
1898	
1899	Varro's
1900	First Servant	Yes, mine's three thousand crowns: what's yours?
1901	
1902	Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand mine.
1903	
1904	Varro's
1905	First Servant	'Tis much deep: and it should seem by the sun,
1906	Your master's confidence was above mine;
1907	Else, surely, his had equall'd.
1908	
1909	Enter FLAMINIUS.
1910	
1911	TITUS	One of Lord Timon's men.
1912	
1913	Lucilius' Servant	Flaminius! Sir, a word: pray, is my lord ready to
1914	come forth?
1915	
1916	FLAMINIUS	No, indeed, he is not.
1917	
1918	TITUS	We attend his lordship; pray, signify so much.
1919	
1920	FLAMINIUS	I need not tell him that; he knows you are too diligent.
1921	
1922	[Exit]
1923	
1924	[Enter FLAVIUS in a cloak, muffled]
1925	
1926	Lucilius' Servant	Ha! is not that his steward muffled so?
1927	He goes away in a cloud: call him, call him.
1928	
1929	TITUS	Do you hear, sir?
1930	
1931	Varro's
1932	Second Servant	By your leave, sir,--
1933	
1934	FLAVIUS	What do ye ask of me, my friend?
1935	
1936	TITUS	We wait for certain money here, sir.
1937	
1938	FLAVIUS	Ay,
1939	If money were as certain as your waiting,
1940	'Twere sure enough.
1941	Why then preferr'd you not your sums and bills,
1942	When your false masters eat of my lord's meat?
1943	Then they could smile and fawn upon his debts
1944	And take down the interest into their
1945	gluttonous maws.
1946	You do yourselves but wrong to stir me up;
1947	Let me pass quietly:
1948	Believe 't, my lord and I have made an end;
1949	I have no more to reckon, he to spend.
1950	
1951	Lucilius' Servant	Ay, but this answer will not serve.
1952	
1953	FLAVIUS	If 'twill not serve,'tis not so base as you;
1954	For you serve knaves.
1955	
1956	[Exit]
1957	
1958	Varro's
1959	First Servant	How! what does his cashiered worship mutter?
1960	
1961	Varro's
1962	Second Servant	No matter what; he's poor, and that's revenge
1963	enough. Who can speak broader than he that has no
1964	house to put his head in? such may rail against
1965	great buildings.
1966	
1967	[Enter SERVILIUS]
1968	
1969	TITUS	O, here's Servilius; now we shall know some answer.
1970	
1971	SERVILIUS	If I might beseech you, gentlemen, to repair some
1972	other hour, I should derive much from't; for,
1973	take't of my soul, my lord leans wondrously to
1974	discontent: his comfortable temper has forsook him;
1975	he's much out of health, and keeps his chamber.
1976	
1977	Lucilius' Servant: Many do keep their chambers are not sick:
1978	And, if it be so far beyond his health,
1979	Methinks he should the sooner pay his debts,
1980	And make a clear way to the gods.
1981	
1982	SERVILIUS	Good gods!
1983	
1984	TITUS	We cannot take this for answer, sir.
1985	
1986	FLAMINIUS	[Within]  Servilius, help! My lord! my lord!
1987	
1988	[Enter TIMON, in a rage, FLAMINIUS following]
1989	
1990	TIMON	What, are my doors opposed against my passage?
1991	Have I been ever free, and must my house
1992	Be my retentive enemy, my gaol?
1993	The place which I have feasted, does it now,
1994	Like all mankind, show me an iron heart?
1995	
1996	Lucilius' Servant	Put in now, Titus.
1997	
1998	TITUS	My lord, here is my bill.
1999	
2000	Lucilius' Servant	Here's mine.
2001	
2002	HORTENSIUS	And mine, my lord.
2003	
2004	Both
2005	Varro's Servants	And ours, my lord.
2006	
2007	PHILOTUS	All our bills.
2008	
2009	TIMON	Knock me down with 'em: cleave me to the girdle.
2010	
2011	Lucilius' Servant	Alas, my lord,-
2012	
2013	TIMON	Cut my heart in sums.
2014	
2015	TITUS	Mine, fifty talents.
2016	
2017	TIMON	Tell out my blood.
2018	
2019	Lucilius' Servant	Five thousand crowns, my lord.
2020	
2021	TIMON	Five thousand drops pays that.
2022	What yours?--and yours?
2023	
2024	Varro's
2025	First Servant	My lord,--
2026	
2027	Varro's
2028	Second Servant	My lord,--
2029	
2030	TIMON	Tear me, take me, and the gods fall upon you!
2031	
2032	[Exit]
2033	
2034	HORTENSIUS	'Faith, I perceive our masters may throw their caps
2035	at their money: these debts may well be called
2036	desperate ones, for a madman owes 'em.
2037	
2038	[Exeunt]
2039	
2040	[Re-enter TIMON and FLAVIUS]
2041	
2042	TIMON	They have e'en put my breath from me, the slaves.
2043	Creditors? devils!
2044	
2045	FLAVIUS	My dear lord,--
2046	
2047	TIMON	What if it should be so?
2048	
2049	FLAVIUS	My lord,--
2050	
2051	TIMON	I'll have it so. My steward!
2052	
2053	FLAVIUS	Here, my lord.
2054	
2055	TIMON	So fitly? Go, bid all my friends again,
2056	Lucius, Lucullus, and Sempronius:
2057	All, sirrah, all:
2058	I'll once more feast the rascals.
2059	
2060	FLAVIUS	O my lord,
2061	You only speak from your distracted soul;
2062	There is not so much left, to furnish out
2063	A moderate table.
2064	
2065	TIMON	                  Be't not in thy care; go,
2066	I charge thee, invite them all: let in the tide
2067	Of knaves once more; my cook and I'll provide.
2068	
2069	[Exeunt]

2074	TIMON OF ATHENS
2075	
2076	
2077	ACT III
2078	
2079	
2080	
2081	SCENE V	The same. The senate-house. The Senate sitting.
2082	
2083	
2084	First Senator	My lord, you have my voice to it; the fault's
2085	Bloody; 'tis necessary he should die:
2086	Nothing emboldens sin so much as mercy.
2087	
2088	Second Senator	Most true; the law shall bruise him.
2089	
2090	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with Attendants]
2091	
2092	ALCIBIADES	Honour, health, and compassion to the senate!
2093	
2094	First Senator	Now, captain?
2095	
2096	ALCIBIADES	I am an humble suitor to your virtues;
2097	For pity is the virtue of the law,
2098	And none but tyrants use it cruelly.
2099	It pleases time and fortune to lie heavy
2100	Upon a friend of mine, who, in hot blood,
2101	Hath stepp'd into the law, which is past depth
2102	To those that, without heed, do plunge into 't.
2103	He is a man, setting his fate aside,
2104	Of comely virtues:
2105	Nor did he soil the fact with cowardice--
2106	An honour in him which buys out his fault--
2107	But with a noble fury and fair spirit,
2108	Seeing his reputation touch'd to death,
2109	He did oppose his foe:
2110	And with such sober and unnoted passion
2111	He did behave his anger, ere 'twas spent,
2112	As if he had but proved an argument.
2113	
2114	First Senator	You undergo too strict a paradox,
2115	Striving to make an ugly deed look fair:
2116	Your words have took such pains as if they labour'd
2117	To bring manslaughter into form and set quarrelling
2118	Upon the head of valour; which indeed
2119	Is valour misbegot and came into the world
2120	When sects and factions were newly born:
2121	He's truly valiant that can wisely suffer
2122	The worst that man can breathe, and make his wrongs
2123	His outsides, to wear them like his raiment,
2124	carelessly,
2125	And ne'er prefer his injuries to his heart,
2126	To bring it into danger.
2127	If wrongs be evils and enforce us kill,
2128	What folly 'tis to hazard life for ill!
2129	
2130	ALCIBIADES	My lord,--
2131	
2132	First Senator	       You cannot make gross sins look clear:
2133	To revenge is no valour, but to bear.
2134	
2135	ALCIBIADES	My lords, then, under favour, pardon me,
2136	If I speak like a captain.
2137	Why do fond men expose themselves to battle,
2138	And not endure all threats? sleep upon't,
2139	And let the foes quietly cut their throats,
2140	Without repugnancy? If there be
2141	Such valour in the bearing, what make we
2142	Abroad? why then, women are more valiant
2143	That stay at home, if bearing carry it,
2144	And the ass more captain than the lion, the felon
2145	Loaden with irons wiser than the judge,
2146	If wisdom be in suffering. O my lords,
2147	As you are great, be pitifully good:
2148	Who cannot condemn rashness in cold blood?
2149	To kill, I grant, is sin's extremest gust;
2150	But, in defence, by mercy, 'tis most just.
2151	To be in anger is impiety;
2152	But who is man that is not angry?
2153	Weigh but the crime with this.
2154	
2155	Second Senator	You breathe in vain.
2156	
2157	ALCIBIADES	In vain! his service done
2158	At Lacedaemon and Byzantium
2159	Were a sufficient briber for his life.
2160	
2161	First Senator	What's that?
2162	
2163	ALCIBIADES	I say, my lords, he has done fair service,
2164	And slain in fight many of your enemies:
2165	How full of valour did he bear himself
2166	In the last conflict, and made plenteous wounds!
2167	
2168	Second Senator	He has made too much plenty with 'em;
2169	He's a sworn rioter: he has a sin that often
2170	Drowns him, and takes his valour prisoner:
2171	If there were no foes, that were enough
2172	To overcome him: in that beastly fury
2173	He has been known to commit outrages,
2174	And cherish factions: 'tis inferr'd to us,
2175	His days are foul and his drink dangerous.
2176	
2177	First Senator	He dies.
2178	
2179	ALCIBIADES	Hard fate! he might have died in war.
2180	My lords, if not for any parts in him--
2181	Though his right arm might purchase his own time
2182	And be in debt to none--yet, more to move you,
2183	Take my deserts to his, and join 'em both:
2184	And, for I know your reverend ages love
2185	Security, I'll pawn my victories, all
2186	My honours to you, upon his good returns.
2187	If by this crime he owes the law his life,
2188	Why, let the war receive 't in valiant gore
2189	For law is strict, and war is nothing more.
2190	
2191	First Senator	We are for law: he dies; urge it no more,
2192	On height of our displeasure: friend or brother,
2193	He forfeits his own blood that spills another.
2194	
2195	ALCIBIADES	Must it be so? it must not be. My lords,
2196	I do beseech you, know me.
2197	
2198	Second Senator	How!
2199	
2200	ALCIBIADES	Call me to your remembrances.
2201	
2202	Third Senator	What!
2203	
2204	ALCIBIADES	I cannot think but your age has forgot me;
2205	It could not else be, I should prove so base,
2206	To sue, and be denied such common grace:
2207	My wounds ache at you.
2208	
2209	First Senator	Do you dare our anger?
2210	'Tis in few words, but spacious in effect;
2211	We banish thee for ever.
2212	
2213	ALCIBIADES	Banish me!
2214	Banish your dotage; banish usury,
2215	That makes the senate ugly.
2216	
2217	First Senator	If, after two days' shine, Athens contain thee,
2218	Attend our weightier judgment. And, not to swell
2219	our spirit,
2220	He shall be executed presently.
2221	
2222	[Exeunt Senators]
2223	
2224	ALCIBIADES	Now the gods keep you old enough; that you may live
2225	Only in bone, that none may look on you!
2226	I'm worse than mad: I have kept back their foes,
2227	While they have told their money and let out
2228	Their coin upon large interest, I myself
2229	Rich only in large hurts. All those for this?
2230	Is this the balsam that the usuring senate
2231	Pours into captains' wounds? Banishment!
2232	It comes not ill; I hate not to be banish'd;
2233	It is a cause worthy my spleen and fury,
2234	That I may strike at Athens. I'll cheer up
2235	My discontented troops, and lay for hearts.
2236	'Tis honour with most lands to be at odds;
2237	Soldiers should brook as little wrongs as gods.

2244	TIMON OF ATHENS
2245	
2246	
2247	ACT III
2248	
2249	
2250	
2251	SCENE VI	The same. A banqueting-room in Timon's house.
2252	
2253	
2254	[Music. Tables set out: Servants attending.
2255	Enter divers Lords, Senators and others, at
2256	several doors]
2257	
2258	First Lord	The good time of day to you, sir.
2259	
2260	Second Lord	I also wish it to you. I think this honourable lord
2261	did but try us this other day.
2262	
2263	First Lord	Upon that were my thoughts tiring, when we
2264	encountered: I hope it is not so low with him as
2265	he made it seem in the trial of his several friends.
2266	
2267	Second Lord	It should not be, by the persuasion of his new feasting.
2268	
2269	First Lord	I should think so: he hath sent me an earnest
2270	inviting, which many my near occasions did urge me
2271	to put off; but he hath conjured me beyond them, and
2272	I must needs appear.
2273	
2274	Second Lord	In like manner was I in debt to my importunate
2275	business, but he would not hear my excuse. I am
2276	sorry, when he sent to borrow of me, that my
2277	provision was out.
2278	
2279	First Lord	I am sick of that grief too, as I understand how all
2280	things go.
2281	
2282	Second Lord	Every man here's so. What would he have borrowed of
2283	you?
2284	
2285	First Lord	A thousand pieces.
2286	
2287	Second Lord	A thousand pieces!
2288	
2289	First Lord	What of you?
2290	
2291	Second Lord	He sent to me, sir,--Here he comes.
2292	
2293	[Enter TIMON and Attendants]
2294	
2295	TIMON	With all my heart, gentlemen both; and how fare you?
2296	
2297	First Lord	Ever at the best, hearing well of your lordship.
2298	
2299	Second Lord	The swallow follows not summer more willing than we
2300	your lordship.
2301	
2302	TIMON	[Aside]  Nor more willingly leaves winter; such
2303	summer-birds are men. Gentlemen, our dinner will not
2304	recompense this long stay: feast your ears with the
2305	music awhile, if they will fare so harshly o' the
2306	trumpet's sound; we shall to 't presently.
2307	
2308	First Lord	I hope it remains not unkindly with your lordship
2309	that I returned you an empty messenger.
2310	
2311	TIMON	O, sir, let it not trouble you.
2312	
2313	Second Lord	My noble lord,--
2314	
2315	TIMON	Ah, my good friend, what cheer?
2316	
2317	Second Lord	My most honourable lord, I am e'en sick of shame,
2318	that, when your lordship this other day sent to me,
2319	I was so unfortunate a beggar.
2320	
2321	TIMON	Think not on 't, sir.
2322	
2323	Second Lord	If you had sent but two hours before,--
2324	
2325	TIMON	Let it not cumber your better remembrance.
2326	
2327	[The banquet brought in]
2328	
2329	Come, bring in all together.
2330	
2331	Second Lord	All covered dishes!
2332	
2333	First Lord	Royal cheer, I warrant you.
2334	
2335	Third Lord	Doubt not that, if money and the season can yield
2336	it.
2337	
2338	First Lord	How do you? What's the news?
2339	
2340	Third Lord	Alcibiades is banished: hear you of it?
2341	
2342	
2343	First Lord	|
2344	|  Alcibiades banished!
2345	Second Lord	|
2346	
2347	
2348	Third Lord	'Tis so, be sure of it.
2349	
2350	First Lord	How! how!
2351	
2352	Second Lord	I pray you, upon what?
2353	
2354	TIMON	My worthy friends, will you draw near?
2355	
2356	Third Lord	I'll tell you more anon. Here's a noble feast toward.
2357	
2358	Second Lord	This is the old man still.
2359	
2360	Third Lord	Will 't hold? will 't hold?
2361	
2362	Second Lord	It does: but time will--and so--
2363	
2364	Third Lord	I do conceive.
2365	
2366	TIMON	Each man to his stool, with that spur as he would to
2367	the lip of his mistress: your diet shall be in all
2368	places alike. Make not a city feast of it, to let
2369	the meat cool ere we can agree upon the first place:
2370	sit, sit. The gods require our thanks.
2371	
2372	You great benefactors, sprinkle our society with
2373	thankfulness. For your own gifts, make yourselves
2374	praised: but reserve still to give, lest your
2375	deities be despised. Lend to each man enough, that
2376	one need not lend to another; for, were your
2377	godheads to borrow of men, men would forsake the
2378	gods. Make the meat be beloved more than the man
2379	that gives it. Let no assembly of twenty be without
2380	a score of villains: if there sit twelve women at
2381	the table, let a dozen of them be--as they are. The
2382	rest of your fees, O gods--the senators of Athens,
2383	together with the common lag of people--what is
2384	amiss in them, you gods, make suitable for
2385	destruction. For these my present friends, as they
2386	are to me nothing, so in nothing bless them, and to
2387	nothing are they welcome.
2388	
2389	Uncover, dogs, and lap.
2390	
2391	[The dishes are uncovered and seen to be full of
2392	warm water]
2393	
2394	Some Speak	What does his lordship mean?
2395	
2396	Some Others	I know not.
2397	
2398	TIMON	May you a better feast never behold,
2399	You knot of mouth-friends I smoke and lukewarm water
2400	Is your perfection. This is Timon's last;
2401	Who, stuck and spangled with your flatteries,
2402	Washes it off, and sprinkles in your faces
2403	Your reeking villany.
2404	
2405	[Throwing the water in their faces]
2406	
2407	Live loathed and long,
2408	Most smiling, smooth, detested parasites,
2409	Courteous destroyers, affable wolves, meek bears,
2410	You fools of fortune, trencher-friends, time's flies,
2411	Cap and knee slaves, vapours, and minute-jacks!
2412	Of man and beast the infinite malady
2413	Crust you quite o'er! What, dost thou go?
2414	Soft! take thy physic first--thou too--and thou;--
2415	Stay, I will lend thee money, borrow none.
2416	
2417	[Throws the dishes at them, and drives them out]
2418	
2419	What, all in motion? Henceforth be no feast,
2420	Whereat a villain's not a welcome guest.
2421	Burn, house! sink, Athens! henceforth hated be
2422	Of Timon man and all humanity!
2423	
2424	[Exit]
2425	
2426	[Re-enter the Lords, Senators, &c]
2427	
2428	First Lord	How now, my lords!
2429	
2430	Second Lord	Know you the quality of Lord Timon's fury?
2431	
2432	Third Lord	Push! did you see my cap?
2433	
2434	Fourth Lord	I have lost my gown.
2435	
2436	First Lord	He's but a mad lord, and nought but humour sways him.
2437	He gave me a jewel th' other day, and now he has
2438	beat it out of my hat: did you see my jewel?
2439	
2440	Third Lord	Did you see my cap?
2441	
2442	Second Lord	Here 'tis.
2443	
2444	Fourth Lord	Here lies my gown.
2445	
2446	First Lord	Let's make no stay.
2447	
2448	Second Lord	Lord Timon's mad.
2449	
2450	Third Lord	I feel 't upon my bones.
2451	
2452	Fourth Lord	One day he gives us diamonds, next day stones.

2460	
2461	
2462	ACT IV
2463	
2464	
2465	
2466	SCENE I	Without the walls of Athens.
2467	
2468	
2469	[Enter TIMON]
2470	
2471	TIMON	Let me look back upon thee. O thou wall,
2472	That girdlest in those wolves, dive in the earth,
2473	And fence not Athens! Matrons, turn incontinent!
2474	Obedience fail in children! slaves and fools,
2475	Pluck the grave wrinkled senate from the bench,
2476	And minister in their steads! to general filths
2477	Convert o' the instant, green virginity,
2478	Do 't in your parents' eyes! bankrupts, hold fast;
2479	Rather than render back, out with your knives,
2480	And cut your trusters' throats! bound servants, steal!
2481	Large-handed robbers your grave masters are,
2482	And pill by law. Maid, to thy master's bed;
2483	Thy mistress is o' the brothel! Son of sixteen,
2484	pluck the lined crutch from thy old limping sire,
2485	With it beat out his brains! Piety, and fear,
2486	Religion to the gods, peace, justice, truth,
2487	Domestic awe, night-rest, and neighbourhood,
2488	Instruction, manners, mysteries, and trades,
2489	Degrees, observances, customs, and laws,
2490	Decline to your confounding contraries,
2491	And let confusion live! Plagues, incident to men,
2492	Your potent and infectious fevers heap
2493	On Athens, ripe for stroke! Thou cold sciatica,
2494	Cripple our senators, that their limbs may halt
2495	As lamely as their manners. Lust and liberty
2496	Creep in the minds and marrows of our youth,
2497	That 'gainst the stream of virtue they may strive,
2498	And drown themselves in riot! Itches, blains,
2499	Sow all the Athenian bosoms; and their crop
2500	Be general leprosy! Breath infect breath,
2501	at their society, as their friendship, may
2502	merely poison! Nothing I'll bear from thee,
2503	But nakedness, thou detestable town!
2504	Take thou that too, with multiplying bans!
2505	Timon will to the woods; where he shall find
2506	The unkindest beast more kinder than mankind.
2507	The gods confound--hear me, you good gods all--
2508	The Athenians both within and out that wall!
2509	And grant, as Timon grows, his hate may grow
2510	To the whole race of mankind, high and low! Amen.

2519	
2520	ACT IV
2521	
2522	
2523	
2524	SCENE II	Athens. A room in Timon's house.
2525	
2526	
2527	[Enter FLAVIUS, with two or three Servants]
2528	
2529	First Servant	Hear you, master steward, where's our master?
2530	Are we undone? cast off? nothing remaining?
2531	
2532	FLAVIUS	Alack, my fellows, what should I say to you?
2533	Let me be recorded by the righteous gods,
2534	I am as poor as you.
2535	
2536	First Servant	Such a house broke!
2537	So noble a master fall'n! All gone! and not
2538	One friend to take his fortune by the arm,
2539	And go along with him!
2540	
2541	Second Servant	As we do turn our backs
2542	From our companion thrown into his grave,
2543	So his familiars to his buried fortunes
2544	Slink all away, leave their false vows with him,
2545	Like empty purses pick'd; and his poor self,
2546	A dedicated beggar to the air,
2547	With his disease of all-shunn'd poverty,
2548	Walks, like contempt, alone. More of our fellows.
2549	
2550	[Enter other Servants]
2551	
2552	FLAVIUS	All broken implements of a ruin'd house.
2553	
2554	Third Servant	Yet do our hearts wear Timon's livery;
2555	That see I by our faces; we are fellows still,
2556	Serving alike in sorrow: leak'd is our bark,
2557	And we, poor mates, stand on the dying deck,
2558	Hearing the surges threat: we must all part
2559	Into this sea of air.
2560	
2561	FLAVIUS	Good fellows all,
2562	The latest of my wealth I'll share amongst you.
2563	Wherever we shall meet, for Timon's sake,
2564	Let's yet be fellows; let's shake our heads, and say,
2565	As 'twere a knell unto our master's fortunes,
2566	'We have seen better days.' Let each take some;
2567	Nay, put out all your hands. Not one word more:
2568	Thus part we rich in sorrow, parting poor.
2569	
2570	[Servants embrace, and part several ways]
2571	
2572	O, the fierce wretchedness that glory brings us!
2573	Who would not wish to be from wealth exempt,
2574	Since riches point to misery and contempt?
2575	Who would be so mock'd with glory? or to live
2576	But in a dream of friendship?
2577	To have his pomp and all what state compounds
2578	But only painted, like his varnish'd friends?
2579	Poor honest lord, brought low by his own heart,
2580	Undone by goodness! Strange, unusual blood,
2581	When man's worst sin is, he does too much good!
2582	Who, then, dares to be half so kind again?
2583	For bounty, that makes gods, does still mar men.
2584	My dearest lord, bless'd, to be most accursed,
2585	Rich, only to be wretched, thy great fortunes
2586	Are made thy chief afflictions. Alas, kind lord!
2587	He's flung in rage from this ingrateful seat
2588	Of monstrous friends, nor has he with him to
2589	Supply his life, or that which can command it.
2590	I'll follow and inquire him out:
2591	I'll ever serve his mind with my best will;
2592	Whilst I have gold, I'll be his steward still.

2601	
2602	ACT IV
2603	
2604	
2605	
2606	SCENE III	Woods and cave, near the seashore.
2607	
2608	
2609	[Enter TIMON, from the cave]
2610	
2611	O blessed breeding sun, draw from the earth
2612	Rotten humidity; below thy sister's orb
2613	Infect the air! Twinn'd brothers of one womb,
2614	Whose procreation, residence, and birth,
2615	Scarce is dividant, touch them with several fortunes;
2616	The greater scorns the lesser: not nature,
2617	To whom all sores lay siege, can bear great fortune,
2618	But by contempt of nature.
2619	Raise me this beggar, and deny 't that lord;
2620	The senator shall bear contempt hereditary,
2621	The beggar native honour.
2622	It is the pasture lards the rother's sides,
2623	The want that makes him lean. Who dares, who dares,
2624	In purity of manhood stand upright,
2625	And say 'This man's a flatterer?' if one be,
2626	So are they all; for every grise of fortune
2627	Is smooth'd by that below: the learned pate
2628	Ducks to the golden fool: all is oblique;
2629	There's nothing level in our cursed natures,
2630	But direct villany. Therefore, be abhorr'd
2631	All feasts, societies, and throngs of men!
2632	His semblable, yea, himself, Timon disdains:
2633	Destruction fang mankind! Earth, yield me roots!
2634	
2635	[Digging]
2636	
2637	Who seeks for better of thee, sauce his palate
2638	With thy most operant poison! What is here?
2639	Gold? yellow, glittering, precious gold? No, gods,
2640	I am no idle votarist: roots, you clear heavens!
2641	Thus much of this will make black white, foul fair,
2642	Wrong right, base noble, old young, coward valiant.
2643	Ha, you gods! why this? what this, you gods? Why, this
2644	Will lug your priests and servants from your sides,
2645	Pluck stout men's pillows from below their heads:
2646	This yellow slave
2647	Will knit and break religions, bless the accursed,
2648	Make the hoar leprosy adored, place thieves
2649	And give them title, knee and approbation
2650	With senators on the bench: this is it
2651	That makes the wappen'd widow wed again;
2652	She, whom the spital-house and ulcerous sores
2653	Would cast the gorge at, this embalms and spices
2654	To the April day again. Come, damned earth,
2655	Thou common whore of mankind, that put'st odds
2656	Among the route of nations, I will make thee
2657	Do thy right nature.
2658	
2659	[March afar off]
2660	
2661	Ha! a drum? Thou'rt quick,
2662	But yet I'll bury thee: thou'lt go, strong thief,
2663	When gouty keepers of thee cannot stand.
2664	Nay, stay thou out for earnest.
2665	
2666	[Keeping some gold]
2667	
2668	[Enter ALCIBIADES, with drum and fife, in
2669	warlike manner; PHRYNIA and TIMANDRA]
2670	
2671	ALCIBIADES	What art thou there? speak.
2672	
2673	TIMON	A beast, as thou art. The canker gnaw thy heart,
2674	For showing me again the eyes of man!
2675	
2676	ALCIBIADES	What is thy name? Is man so hateful to thee,
2677	That art thyself a man?
2678	
2679	TIMON	I am Misanthropos, and hate mankind.
2680	For thy part, I do wish thou wert a dog,
2681	That I might love thee something.
2682	
2683	ALCIBIADES	I know thee well;
2684	But in thy fortunes am unlearn'd and strange.
2685	
2686	TIMON	I know thee too; and more than that I know thee,
2687	I not desire to know. Follow thy drum;
2688	With man's blood paint the ground, gules, gules:
2689	Religious canons, civil laws are cruel;
2690	Then what should war be? This fell whore of thine
2691	Hath in her more destruction than thy sword,
2692	For all her cherubim look.
2693	
2694	PHRYNIA	Thy lips rot off!
2695	
2696	TIMON	I will not kiss thee; then the rot returns
2697	To thine own lips again.
2698	
2699	ALCIBIADES	How came the noble Timon to this change?
2700	
2701	TIMON	As the moon does, by wanting light to give:
2702	But then renew I could not, like the moon;
2703	There were no suns to borrow of.
2704	
2705	ALCIBIADES	Noble Timon,
2706	What friendship may I do thee?
2707	
2708	TIMON	None, but to
2709	Maintain my opinion.
2710	
2711	ALCIBIADES	What is it, Timon?
2712	
2713	TIMON	Promise me friendship, but perform none: if thou
2714	wilt not promise, the gods plague thee, for thou art
2715	a man! if thou dost perform, confound thee, for
2716	thou art a man!
2717	
2718	ALCIBIADES	I have heard in some sort of thy miseries.
2719	
2720	TIMON	Thou saw'st them, when I had prosperity.
2721	
2722	ALCIBIADES	I see them now; then was a blessed time.
2723	
2724	TIMON	As thine is now, held with a brace of harlots.
2725	
2726	TIMANDRA	Is this the Athenian minion, whom the world
2727	Voiced so regardfully?
2728	
2729	TIMON	Art thou Timandra?
2730	
2731	TIMANDRA	Yes.
2732	
2733	TIMON	Be a whore still: they love thee not that use thee;
2734	Give them diseases, leaving with thee their lust.
2735	Make use of thy salt hours: season the slaves
2736	For tubs and baths; bring down rose-cheeked youth
2737	To the tub-fast and the diet.
2738	
2739	TIMANDRA	Hang thee, monster!
2740	
2741	ALCIBIADES	Pardon him, sweet Timandra; for his wits
2742	Are drown'd and lost in his calamities.
2743	I have but little gold of late, brave Timon,
2744	The want whereof doth daily make revolt
2745	In my penurious band: I have heard, and grieved,
2746	How cursed Athens, mindless of thy worth,
2747	Forgetting thy great deeds, when neighbour states,
2748	But for thy sword and fortune, trod upon them,--
2749	
2750	TIMON	I prithee, beat thy drum, and get thee gone.
2751	
2752	ALCIBIADES	I am thy friend, and pity thee, dear Timon.
2753	
2754	TIMON	How dost thou pity him whom thou dost trouble?
2755	I had rather be alone.
2756	
2757	ALCIBIADES	Why, fare thee well:
2758	Here is some gold for thee.
2759	
2760	TIMON	Keep it, I cannot eat it.
2761	
2762	ALCIBIADES	When I have laid proud Athens on a heap,--
2763	
2764	TIMON	Warr'st thou 'gainst Athens?
2765	
2766	ALCIBIADES	Ay, Timon, and have cause.
2767	
2768	TIMON	The gods confound them all in thy conquest;
2769	And thee after, when thou hast conquer'd!
2770	
2771	ALCIBIADES	Why me, Timon?
2772	
2773	TIMON	                  That, by killing of villains,
2774	Thou wast born to conquer my country.
2775	Put up thy gold: go on,--here's gold,--go on;
2776	Be as a planetary plague, when Jove
2777	Will o'er some high-viced city hang his poison
2778	In the sick air: let not thy sword skip one:
2779	Pity not honour'd age for his white beard;
2780	He is an usurer: strike me the counterfeit matron;
2781	It is her habit only that is honest,
2782	Herself's a bawd: let not the virgin's cheek
2783	Make soft thy trenchant sword; for those milk-paps,
2784	That through the window-bars bore at men's eyes,
2785	Are not within the leaf of pity writ,
2786	But set them down horrible traitors: spare not the babe,
2787	Whose dimpled smiles from fools exhaust their mercy;
2788	Think it a bastard, whom the oracle
2789	Hath doubtfully pronounced thy throat shall cut,
2790	And mince it sans remorse: swear against objects;
2791	Put armour on thine ears and on thine eyes;
2792	Whose proof, nor yells of mothers, maids, nor babes,
2793	Nor sight of priests in holy vestments bleeding,
2794	Shall pierce a jot. There's gold to pay soldiers:
2795	Make large confusion; and, thy fury spent,
2796	Confounded be thyself! Speak not, be gone.
2797	
2798	ALCIBIADES	Hast thou gold yet? I'll take the gold thou
2799	givest me,
2800	Not all thy counsel.
2801	
2802	TIMON	Dost thou, or dost thou not, heaven's curse
2803	upon thee!
2804	
2805	
2806	PHRYNIA	|
2807	|  Give us some gold, good Timon: hast thou more?
2808	TIMANDRA	|
2809	
2810	
2811	TIMON	Enough to make a whore forswear her trade,
2812	And to make whores, a bawd. Hold up, you sluts,
2813	Your aprons mountant: you are not oathable,
2814	Although, I know, you 'll swear, terribly swear
2815	Into strong shudders and to heavenly agues
2816	The immortal gods that hear you,--spare your oaths,
2817	I'll trust to your conditions: be whores still;
2818	And he whose pious breath seeks to convert you,
2819	Be strong in whore, allure him, burn him up;
2820	Let your close fire predominate his smoke,
2821	And be no turncoats: yet may your pains, six months,
2822	Be quite contrary: and thatch your poor thin roofs
2823	With burthens of the dead;--some that were hang'd,
2824	No matter:--wear them, betray with them: whore still;
2825	Paint till a horse may mire upon your face,
2826	A pox of wrinkles!
2827	
2828	
2829	PHRYNIA	|
2830	|  Well, more gold: what then?
2831	TIMANDRA	|   Believe't, that we'll do any thing for gold.
2832	
2833	
2834	TIMON	Consumptions sow
2835	In hollow bones of man; strike their sharp shins,
2836	And mar men's spurring. Crack the lawyer's voice,
2837	That he may never more false title plead,
2838	Nor sound his quillets shrilly: hoar the flamen,
2839	That scolds against the quality of flesh,
2840	And not believes himself: down with the nose,
2841	Down with it flat; take the bridge quite away
2842	Of him that, his particular to foresee,
2843	Smells from the general weal: make curl'd-pate
2844	ruffians bald;
2845	And let the unscarr'd braggarts of the war
2846	Derive some pain from you: plague all;
2847	That your activity may defeat and quell
2848	The source of all erection. There's more gold:
2849	Do you damn others, and let this damn you,
2850	And ditches grave you all!
2851	
2852	
2853	PHRYNIA	|
2854	|  More counsel with more money, bounteous Timon.
2855	TIMANDRA	|
2856	
2857	
2858	TIMON	More whore, more mischief first; I have given you earnest.
2859	
2860	ALCIBIADES	Strike up the drum towards Athens! Farewell, Timon:
2861	If I thrive well, I'll visit thee again.
2862	
2863	TIMON	If I hope well, I'll never see thee more.
2864	
2865	ALCIBIADES	I never did thee harm.
2866	
2867	TIMON	Yes, thou spokest well of me.
2868	
2869	ALCIBIADES	Call'st thou that harm?
2870	
2871	TIMON	Men daily find it. Get thee away, and take
2872	Thy beagles with thee.
2873	
2874	ALCIBIADES	We but offend him. Strike!
2875	
2876	[Drum beats. Exeunt ALCIBIADES, PHRYNIA,
2877	and TIMANDRA]
2878	
2879	TIMON	That nature, being sick of man's unkindness,
2880	Should yet be hungry! Common mother, thou,
2881	
2882	[Digging]
2883	
2884	Whose womb unmeasurable, and infinite breast,
2885	Teems, and feeds all; whose self-same mettle,
2886	Whereof thy proud child, arrogant man, is puff'd,
2887	Engenders the black toad and adder blue,
2888	The gilded newt and eyeless venom'd worm,
2889	With all the abhorred births below crisp heaven
2890	Whereon Hyperion's quickening fire doth shine;
2891	Yield him, who all thy human sons doth hate,
2892	From forth thy plenteous bosom, one poor root!
2893	Ensear thy fertile and conceptious womb,
2894	Let it no more bring out ingrateful man!
2895	Go great with tigers, dragons, wolves, and bears;
2896	Teem with new monsters, whom thy upward face
2897	Hath to the marbled mansion all above
2898	Never presented!--O, a root,--dear thanks!--
2899	Dry up thy marrows, vines, and plough-torn leas;
2900	Whereof ungrateful man, with liquorish draughts
2901	And morsels unctuous, greases his pure mind,
2902	That from it all consideration slips!
2903	
2904	[Enter APEMANTUS]
2905	
2906	More man? plague, plague!
2907	
2908	APEMANTUS	I was directed hither: men report
2909	Thou dost affect my manners, and dost use them.
2910	
2911	TIMON	'Tis, then, because thou dost not keep a dog,
2912	Whom I would imitate: consumption catch thee!
2913	
2914	APEMANTUS	This is in thee a nature but infected;
2915	A poor unmanly melancholy sprung
2916	From change of fortune. Why this spade? this place?
2917	This slave-like habit? and these looks of care?
2918	Thy flatterers yet wear silk, drink wine, lie soft;
2919	Hug their diseased perfumes, and have forgot
2920	That ever Timon was. Shame not these woods,
2921	By putting on the cunning of a carper.
2922	Be thou a flatterer now, and seek to thrive
2923	By that which has undone thee: hinge thy knee,
2924	And let his very breath, whom thou'lt observe,
2925	Blow off thy cap; praise his most vicious strain,
2926	And call it excellent: thou wast told thus;
2927	Thou gavest thine ears like tapsters that bid welcome
2928	To knaves and all approachers: 'tis most just
2929	That thou turn rascal; hadst thou wealth again,
2930	Rascals should have 't. Do not assume my likeness.
2931	
2932	TIMON	Were I like thee, I'ld throw away myself.
2933	
2934	APEMANTUS	Thou hast cast away thyself, being like thyself;
2935	A madman so long, now a fool. What, think'st
2936	That the bleak air, thy boisterous chamberlain,
2937	Will put thy shirt on warm? will these moss'd trees,
2938	That have outlived the eagle, page thy heels,
2939	And skip where thou point'st out? will the
2940	cold brook,
2941	Candied with ice, caudle thy morning taste,
2942	To cure thy o'er-night's surfeit? Call the creatures
2943	Whose naked natures live in an the spite
2944	Of wreakful heaven, whose bare unhoused trunks,
2945	To the conflicting elements exposed,
2946	Answer mere nature; bid them flatter thee;
2947	O, thou shalt find--
2948	
2949	TIMON	A fool of thee: depart.
2950	
2951	APEMANTUS	I love thee better now than e'er I did.
2952	
2953	TIMON	I hate thee worse.
2954	
2955	APEMANTUS	                  Why?
2956	
2957	TIMON	Thou flatter'st misery.
2958	
2959	APEMANTUS	I flatter not; but say thou art a caitiff.
2960	
2961	TIMON	Why dost thou seek me out?
2962	
2963	APEMANTUS	To vex thee.
2964	
2965	TIMON	Always a villain's office or a fool's.
2966	Dost please thyself in't?
2967	
2968	APEMANTUS	Ay.
2969	
2970	TIMON	What! a knave too?
2971	
2972	APEMANTUS	If thou didst put this sour-cold habit on
2973	To castigate thy pride, 'twere well: but thou
2974	Dost it enforcedly; thou'ldst courtier be again,
2975	Wert thou not beggar. Willing misery
2976	Outlives encertain pomp, is crown'd before:
2977	The one is filling still, never complete;
2978	The other, at high wish: best state, contentless,
2979	Hath a distracted and most wretched being,
2980	Worse than the worst, content.
2981	Thou shouldst desire to die, being miserable.
2982	
2983	TIMON	Not by his breath that is more miserable.
2984	Thou art a slave, whom Fortune's tender arm
2985	With favour never clasp'd; but bred a dog.
2986	Hadst thou, like us from our first swath, proceeded
2987	The sweet degrees that this brief world affords
2988	To such as may the passive drugs of it
2989	Freely command, thou wouldst have plunged thyself
2990	In general riot; melted down thy youth
2991	In different beds of lust; and never learn'd
2992	The icy precepts of respect, but follow'd
2993	The sugar'd game before thee. But myself,
2994	Who had the world as my confectionary,
2995	The mouths, the tongues, the eyes and hearts of men
2996	At duty, more than I could frame employment,
2997	That numberless upon me stuck as leaves
2998	Do on the oak, hive with one winter's brush
2999	Fell from their boughs and left me open, bare
3000	For every storm that blows: I, to bear this,
3001	That never knew but better, is some burden:
3002	Thy nature did commence in sufferance, time
3003	Hath made thee hard in't. Why shouldst thou hate men?
3004	They never flatter'd thee: what hast thou given?
3005	If thou wilt curse, thy father, that poor rag,
3006	Must be thy subject, who in spite put stuff
3007	To some she beggar and compounded thee
3008	Poor rogue hereditary. Hence, be gone!
3009	If thou hadst not been born the worst of men,
3010	Thou hadst been a knave and flatterer.
3011	
3012	APEMANTUS	Art thou proud yet?
3013	
3014	TIMON	Ay, that I am not thee.
3015	
3016	APEMANTUS	I, that I was
3017	No prodigal.
3018	
3019	TIMON	                  I, that I am one now:
3020	Were all the wealth I have shut up in thee,
3021	I'ld give thee leave to hang it. Get thee gone.
3022	That the whole life of Athens were in this!
3023	Thus would I eat it.
3024	
3025	[Eating a root]
3026	
3027	APEMANTUS	Here; I will mend thy feast.
3028	
3029	[Offering him a root]
3030	
3031	TIMON	First mend my company, take away thyself.
3032	
3033	APEMANTUS	So I shall mend mine own, by the lack of thine.
3034	
3035	TIMON	'Tis not well mended so, it is but botch'd;
3036	if not, I would it were.
3037	
3038	APEMANTUS	What wouldst thou have to Athens?
3039	
3040	TIMON	Thee thither in a whirlwind. If thou wilt,
3041	Tell them there I have gold; look, so I have.
3042	
3043	APEMANTUS	Here is no use for gold.
3044	
3045	TIMON	The best and truest;
3046	For here it sleeps, and does no hired harm.
3047	
3048	APEMANTUS	Where liest o' nights, Timon?
3049	
3050	TIMON	Under that's above me.
3051	Where feed'st thou o' days, Apemantus?
3052	
3053	APEMANTUS	Where my stomach finds meat; or, rather, where I eat
3054	it.
3055	
3056	TIMON	Would poison were obedient and knew my mind!
3057	
3058	APEMANTUS	Where wouldst thou send it?
3059	
3060	TIMON	To sauce thy dishes.
3061	
3062	APEMANTUS	The middle of humanity thou never knewest, but the
3063	extremity of both ends: when thou wast in thy gilt
3064	and thy perfume, they mocked thee for too much
3065	curiosity; in thy rags thou knowest none, but art
3066	despised for the contrary. There's a medlar for
3067	thee, eat it.
3068	
3069	TIMON	On what I hate I feed not.
3070	
3071	APEMANTUS	Dost hate a medlar?
3072	
3073	TIMON	Ay, though it look like thee.
3074	
3075	APEMANTUS	An thou hadst hated meddlers sooner, thou shouldst
3076	have loved thyself better now. What man didst thou
3077	ever know unthrift that was beloved after his means?
3078	
3079	TIMON	Who, without those means thou talkest of, didst thou
3080	ever know beloved?
3081	
3082	APEMANTUS	Myself.
3083	
3084	TIMON	I understand thee; thou hadst some means to keep a
3085	dog.
3086	
3087	APEMANTUS	What things in the world canst thou nearest compare
3088	to thy flatterers?
3089	
3090	TIMON	Women nearest; but men, men are the things
3091	themselves. What wouldst thou do with the world,
3092	Apemantus, if it lay in thy power?
3093	
3094	APEMANTUS	Give it the beasts, to be rid of the men.
3095	
3096	TIMON	Wouldst thou have thyself fall in the confusion of
3097	men, and remain a beast with the beasts?
3098	
3099	APEMANTUS	Ay, Timon.
3100	
3101	TIMON	A beastly ambition, which the gods grant thee t'
3102	attain to! If thou wert the lion, the fox would
3103	beguile thee; if thou wert the lamb, the fox would
3104	eat three: if thou wert the fox, the lion would
3105	suspect thee, when peradventure thou wert accused by
3106	the ass: if thou wert the ass, thy dulness would
3107	torment thee, and still thou livedst but as a
3108	breakfast to the wolf: if thou wert the wolf, thy
3109	greediness would afflict thee, and oft thou shouldst
3110	hazard thy life for thy dinner: wert thou the
3111	unicorn, pride and wrath would confound thee and
3112	make thine own self the conquest of thy fury: wert
3113	thou a bear, thou wouldst be killed by the horse:
3114	wert thou a horse, thou wouldst be seized by the
3115	leopard: wert thou a leopard, thou wert german to
3116	the lion and the spots of thy kindred were jurors on
3117	thy life: all thy safety were remotion and thy
3118	defence absence. What beast couldst thou be, that
3119	were not subject to a beast? and what a beast art
3120	thou already, that seest not thy loss in
3121	transformation!
3122	
3123	APEMANTUS	If thou couldst please me with speaking to me, thou
3124	mightst have hit upon it here: the commonwealth of
3125	Athens is become a forest of beasts.
3126	
3127	TIMON	How has the ass broke the wall, that thou art out of the city?
3128	
3129	APEMANTUS	Yonder comes a poet and a painter: the plague of
3130	company light upon thee! I will fear to catch it
3131	and give way: when I know not what else to do, I'll
3132	see thee again.
3133	
3134	TIMON	When there is nothing living but thee, thou shalt be
3135	welcome. I had rather be a beggar's dog than Apemantus.
3136	
3137	APEMANTUS	Thou art the cap of all the fools alive.
3138	
3139	TIMON	Would thou wert clean enough to spit upon!
3140	
3141	APEMANTUS	A plague on thee! thou art too bad to curse.
3142	
3143	TIMON	All villains that do stand by thee are pure.
3144	
3145	APEMANTUS	There is no leprosy but what thou speak'st.
3146	
3147	TIMON	If I name thee.
3148	I'll beat thee, but I should infect my hands.
3149	
3150	APEMANTUS	I would my tongue could rot them off!
3151	
3152	TIMON	Away, thou issue of a mangy dog!
3153	Choler does kill me that thou art alive;
3154	I swound to see thee.
3155	
3156	APEMANTUS	Would thou wouldst burst!
3157	
3158	TIMON	Away,
3159	Thou tedious rogue! I am sorry I shall lose
3160	A stone by thee.
3161	
3162	[Throws a stone at him]
3163	
3164	APEMANTUS	                  Beast!
3165	
3166	TIMON	Slave!
3167	
3168	APEMANTUS	Toad!
3169	
3170	TIMON	Rogue, rogue, rogue!
3171	I am sick of this false world, and will love nought
3172	But even the mere necessities upon 't.
3173	Then, Timon, presently prepare thy grave;
3174	Lie where the light foam the sea may beat
3175	Thy grave-stone daily: make thine epitaph,
3176	That death in me at others' lives may laugh.
3177	
3178	[To the gold]
3179	
3180	O thou sweet king-killer, and dear divorce
3181	'Twixt natural son and sire! thou bright defiler
3182	Of Hymen's purest bed! thou valiant Mars!
3183	Thou ever young, fresh, loved and delicate wooer,
3184	Whose blush doth thaw the consecrated snow
3185	That lies on Dian's lap! thou visible god,
3186	That solder'st close impossibilities,
3187	And makest them kiss! that speak'st with
3188	every tongue,
3189	To every purpose! O thou touch of hearts!
3190	Think, thy slave man rebels, and by thy virtue
3191	Set them into confounding odds, that beasts
3192	May have the world in empire!
3193	
3194	APEMANTUS	Would 'twere so!
3195	But not till I am dead. I'll say thou'st gold:
3196	Thou wilt be throng'd to shortly.
3197	
3198	TIMON	Throng'd to!
3199	
3200	APEMANTUS	Ay.
3201	
3202	TIMON	Thy back, I prithee.
3203	
3204	APEMANTUS	Live, and love thy misery.
3205	
3206	TIMON	Long live so, and so die.
3207	
3208	[Exit APEMANTUS]
3209	
3210	I am quit.
3211	Moe things like men! Eat, Timon, and abhor them.
3212	
3213	[Enter Banditti]
3214	
3215	First Bandit	Where should he have this gold? It is some poor
3216	fragment, some slender sort of his remainder: the
3217	mere want of gold, and the falling-from of his
3218	friends, drove him into this melancholy.
3219	
3220	Second Bandit	It is noised he hath a mass of treasure.
3221	
3222	Third Bandit	Let us make the assay upon him: if he care not
3223	for't, he will supply us easily; if he covetously
3224	reserve it, how shall's get it?
3225	
3226	Second Bandit	True; for he bears it not about him, 'tis hid.
3227	
3228	First Bandit	Is not this he?
3229	
3230	Banditti	Where?
3231	
3232	Second Bandit	'Tis his description.
3233	
3234	Third Bandit	He; I know him.
3235	
3236	Banditti	Save thee, Timon.
3237	
3238	TIMON	Now, thieves?
3239	
3240	Banditti	Soldiers, not thieves.
3241	
3242	TIMON	Both too; and women's sons.
3243	
3244	Banditti	We are not thieves, but men that much do want.
3245	
3246	TIMON	Your greatest want is, you want much of meat.
3247	Why should you want? Behold, the earth hath roots;
3248	Within this mile break forth a hundred springs;
3249	The oaks bear mast, the briers scarlet hips;
3250	The bounteous housewife, nature, on each bush
3251	Lays her full mess before you. Want! why want?
3252	
3253	First Bandit	We cannot live on grass, on berries, water,
3254	As beasts and birds and fishes.
3255	
3256	TIMON	Nor on the beasts themselves, the birds, and fishes;
3257	You must eat men. Yet thanks I must you con
3258	That you are thieves profess'd, that you work not
3259	In holier shapes: for there is boundless theft
3260	In limited professions. Rascal thieves,
3261	Here's gold. Go, suck the subtle blood o' the grape,
3262	Till the high fever seethe your blood to froth,
3263	And so 'scape hanging: trust not the physician;
3264	His antidotes are poison, and he slays
3265	Moe than you rob: take wealth and lives together;
3266	Do villany, do, since you protest to do't,
3267	Like workmen. I'll example you with thievery.
3268	The sun's a thief, and with his great attraction
3269	Robs the vast sea: the moon's an arrant thief,
3270	And her pale fire she snatches from the sun:
3271	The sea's a thief, whose liquid surge resolves
3272	The moon into salt tears: the earth's a thief,
3273	That feeds and breeds by a composture stolen
3274	From general excrement: each thing's a thief:
3275	The laws, your curb and whip, in their rough power
3276	Have uncheque'd theft. Love not yourselves: away,
3277	Rob one another. There's more gold. Cut throats:
3278	All that you meet are thieves: to Athens go,
3279	Break open shops; nothing can you steal,
3280	But thieves do lose it: steal no less for this
3281	I give you; and gold confound you howsoe'er! Amen.
3282	
3283	Third Bandit	Has almost charmed me from my profession, by
3284	persuading me to it.
3285	
3286	First Bandit	'Tis in the malice of mankind that he thus advises
3287	us; not to have us thrive in our mystery.
3288	
3289	Second Bandit	I'll believe him as an enemy, and give over my trade.
3290	
3291	First Bandit	Let us first see peace in Athens: there is no time
3292	so miserable but a man may be true.
3293	
3294	[Exeunt Banditti]
3295	
3296	[Enter FLAVIUS]
3297	
3298	FLAVIUS	O you gods!
3299	Is yond despised and ruinous man my lord?
3300	Full of decay and failing? O monument
3301	And wonder of good deeds evilly bestow'd!
3302	What an alteration of honour
3303	Has desperate want made!
3304	What viler thing upon the earth than friends
3305	Who can bring noblest minds to basest ends!
3306	How rarely does it meet with this time's guise,
3307	When man was wish'd to love his enemies!
3308	Grant I may ever love, and rather woo
3309	Those that would mischief me than those that do!
3310	Has caught me in his eye: I will present
3311	My honest grief unto him; and, as my lord,
3312	Still serve him with my life. My dearest master!
3313	
3314	TIMON	Away! what art thou?
3315	
3316	FLAVIUS	Have you forgot me, sir?
3317	
3318	TIMON	Why dost ask that? I have forgot all men;
3319	Then, if thou grant'st thou'rt a man, I have forgot thee.
3320	
3321	FLAVIUS	An honest poor servant of yours.
3322	
3323	TIMON	Then I know thee not:
3324	I never had honest man about me, I; all
3325	I kept were knaves, to serve in meat to villains.
3326	
3327	FLAVIUS	The gods are witness,
3328	Ne'er did poor steward wear a truer grief
3329	For his undone lord than mine eyes for you.
3330	
3331	TIMON	What, dost thou weep? Come nearer. Then I
3332	love thee,
3333	Because thou art a woman, and disclaim'st
3334	Flinty mankind; whose eyes do never give
3335	But thorough lust and laughter. Pity's sleeping:
3336	Strange times, that weep with laughing, not with weeping!
3337	
3338	FLAVIUS	I beg of you to know me, good my lord,
3339	To accept my grief and whilst this poor wealth lasts
3340	To entertain me as your steward still.
3341	
3342	TIMON	Had I a steward
3343	So true, so just, and now so comfortable?
3344	It almost turns my dangerous nature mild.
3345	Let me behold thy face. Surely, this man
3346	Was born of woman.
3347	Forgive my general and exceptless rashness,
3348	You perpetual-sober gods! I do proclaim
3349	One honest man--mistake me not--but one;
3350	No more, I pray,--and he's a steward.
3351	How fain would I have hated all mankind!
3352	And thou redeem'st thyself: but all, save thee,
3353	I fell with curses.
3354	Methinks thou art more honest now than wise;
3355	For, by oppressing and betraying me,
3356	Thou mightst have sooner got another service:
3357	For many so arrive at second masters,
3358	Upon their first lord's neck. But tell me true--
3359	For I must ever doubt, though ne'er so sure--
3360	Is not thy kindness subtle, covetous,
3361	If not a usuring kindness, and, as rich men deal gifts,
3362	Expecting in return twenty for one?
3363	
3364	FLAVIUS	No, my most worthy master; in whose breast
3365	Doubt and suspect, alas, are placed too late:
3366	You should have fear'd false times when you did feast:
3367	Suspect still comes where an estate is least.
3368	That which I show, heaven knows, is merely love,
3369	Duty and zeal to your unmatched mind,
3370	Care of your food and living; and, believe it,
3371	My most honour'd lord,
3372	For any benefit that points to me,
3373	Either in hope or present, I'ld exchange
3374	For this one wish, that you had power and wealth
3375	To requite me, by making rich yourself.
3376	
3377	TIMON	Look thee, 'tis so! Thou singly honest man,
3378	Here, take: the gods out of my misery
3379	Have sent thee treasure. Go, live rich and happy;
3380	But thus condition'd: thou shalt build from men;
3381	Hate all, curse all, show charity to none,
3382	But let the famish'd flesh slide from the bone,
3383	Ere thou relieve the beggar; give to dogs
3384	What thou deny'st to men; let prisons swallow 'em,
3385	Debts wither 'em to nothing; be men like
3386	blasted woods,
3387	And may diseases lick up their false bloods!
3388	And so farewell and thrive.
3389	
3390	FLAVIUS	O, let me stay,
3391	And comfort you, my master.
3392	
3393	TIMON	If thou hatest curses,
3394	Stay not; fly, whilst thou art blest and free:
3395	Ne'er see thou man, and let me ne'er see thee.
3396	
3397	[Exit FLAVIUS. TIMON retires to his cave]
3398	
3399	
3400	
3401	
3402	TIMON OF ATHENS
3403	
3404	
3405	ACT V
3406	
3407	
3408	
3409	SCENE I	The woods. Before Timon's cave.
3410	
3411	
3412	[Enter Poet and Painter; TIMON watching
3413	them from his cave]
3414	
3415	Painter	As I took note of the place, it cannot be far where
3416	he abides.
3417	
3418	Poet	What's to be thought of him? does the rumour hold
3419	for true, that he's so full of gold?
3420	
3421	Painter	Certain: Alcibiades reports it; Phrynia and
3422	Timandra had gold of him: he likewise enriched poor
3423	straggling soldiers with great quantity: 'tis said
3424	he gave unto his steward a mighty sum.
3425	
3426	Poet	Then this breaking of his has been but a try for his friends.
3427	
3428	Painter	Nothing else: you shall see him a palm in Athens
3429	again, and flourish with the highest. Therefore
3430	'tis not amiss we tender our loves to him, in this
3431	supposed distress of his: it will show honestly in
3432	us; and is very likely to load our purposes with
3433	what they travail for, if it be a just true report
3434	that goes of his having.
3435	
3436	Poet	What have you now to present unto him?
3437	
3438	Painter	Nothing at this time but my visitation: only I will
3439	promise him an excellent piece.
3440	
3441	Poet	I must serve him so too, tell him of an intent
3442	that's coming toward him.
3443	
3444	Painter	Good as the best. Promising is the very air o' the
3445	time: it opens the eyes of expectation:
3446	performance is ever the duller for his act; and,
3447	but in the plainer and simpler kind of people, the
3448	deed of saying is quite out of use. To promise is
3449	most courtly and fashionable: performance is a kind
3450	of will or testament which argues a great sickness
3451	in his judgment that makes it.
3452	
3453	[TIMON comes from his cave, behind]
3454	
3455	TIMON	[Aside]  Excellent workman! thou canst not paint a
3456	man so bad as is thyself.
3457	
3458	Poet	I am thinking what I shall say I have provided for
3459	him: it must be a personating of himself; a satire
3460	against the softness of prosperity, with a discovery
3461	of the infinite flatteries that follow youth and opulency.
3462	
3463	TIMON	[Aside]  Must thou needs stand for a villain in
3464	thine own work? wilt thou whip thine own faults in
3465	other men? Do so, I have gold for thee.
3466	
3467	Poet	Nay, let's seek him:
3468	Then do we sin against our own estate,
3469	When we may profit meet, and come too late.
3470	
3471	Painter	True;
3472	When the day serves, before black-corner'd night,
3473	Find what thou want'st by free and offer'd light. Come.
3474	
3475	TIMON	[Aside]  I'll meet you at the turn. What a
3476	god's gold,
3477	That he is worshipp'd in a baser temple
3478	Than where swine feed!
3479	'Tis thou that rigg'st the bark and plough'st the foam,
3480	Settlest admired reverence in a slave:
3481	To thee be worship! and thy saints for aye
3482	Be crown'd with plagues that thee alone obey!
3483	Fit I meet them.
3484	
3485	[Coming forward]
3486	
3487	Poet	Hail, worthy Timon!
3488	
3489	Painter	Our late noble master!
3490	
3491	TIMON	Have I once lived to see two honest men?
3492	
3493	Poet	Sir,
3494	Having often of your open bounty tasted,
3495	Hearing you were retired, your friends fall'n off,
3496	Whose thankless natures--O abhorred spirits!--
3497	Not all the whips of heaven are large enough:
3498	What! to you,
3499	Whose star-like nobleness gave life and influence
3500	To their whole being! I am rapt and cannot cover
3501	The monstrous bulk of this ingratitude
3502	With any size of words.
3503	
3504	TIMON	Let it go naked, men may see't the better:
3505	You that are honest, by being what you are,
3506	Make them best seen and known.
3507	
3508	Painter	He and myself
3509	Have travail'd in the great shower of your gifts,
3510	And sweetly felt it.
3511	
3512	TIMON	Ay, you are honest men.
3513	
3514	Painter	We are hither come to offer you our service.
3515	
3516	TIMON	Most honest men! Why, how shall I requite you?
3517	Can you eat roots, and drink cold water? no.
3518	
3519	Both	What we can do, we'll do, to do you service.
3520	
3521	TIMON	Ye're honest men: ye've heard that I have gold;
3522	I am sure you have: speak truth; ye're honest men.
3523	
3524	Painter	So it is said, my noble lord; but therefore
3525	Came not my friend nor I.
3526	
3527	TIMON	Good honest men! Thou draw'st a counterfeit
3528	Best in all Athens: thou'rt, indeed, the best;
3529	Thou counterfeit'st most lively.
3530	
3531	Painter	So, so, my lord.
3532	
3533	TIMON	E'en so, sir, as I say. And, for thy fiction,
3534	Why, thy verse swells with stuff so fine and smooth
3535	That thou art even natural in thine art.
3536	But, for all this, my honest-natured friends,
3537	I must needs say you have a little fault:
3538	Marry, 'tis not monstrous in you, neither wish I
3539	You take much pains to mend.
3540	
3541	Both	Beseech your honour
3542	To make it known to us.
3543	
3544	TIMON	You'll take it ill.
3545	
3546	Both	Most thankfully, my lord.
3547	
3548	TIMON	Will you, indeed?
3549	
3550	Both	Doubt it not, worthy lord.
3551	
3552	TIMON	There's never a one of you but trusts a knave,
3553	That mightily deceives you.
3554	
3555	Both	Do we, my lord?
3556	
3557	TIMON	Ay, and you hear him cog, see him dissemble,
3558	Know his gross patchery, love him, feed him,
3559	Keep in your bosom: yet remain assured
3560	That he's a made-up villain.
3561	
3562	Painter	I know none such, my lord.
3563	
3564	Poet	Nor I.
3565	
3566	TIMON	Look you, I love you well; I'll give you gold,
3567	Rid me these villains from your companies:
3568	Hang them or stab them, drown them in a draught,
3569	Confound them by some course, and come to me,
3570	I'll give you gold enough.
3571	
3572	Both	Name them, my lord, let's know them.
3573	
3574	TIMON	You that way and you this, but two in company;
3575	Each man apart, all single and alone,
3576	Yet an arch-villain keeps him company.
3577	If where thou art two villains shall not be,
3578	Come not near him. If thou wouldst not reside
3579	But where one villain is, then him abandon.
3580	Hence, pack! there's gold; you came for gold, ye slaves:
3581	
3582	[To Painter]
3583	
3584	You have work'd for me; there's payment for you: hence!
3585	
3586	[To Poet]
3587	
3588	You are an alchemist; make gold of that.
3589	Out, rascal dogs!
3590	
3591	[Beats them out, and then retires to his cave]
3592	
3593	[Enter FLAVIUS and two Senators]
3594	
3595	FLAVIUS	It is in vain that you would speak with Timon;
3596	For he is set so only to himself
3597	That nothing but himself which looks like man
3598	Is friendly with him.
3599	
3600	First Senator	Bring us to his cave:
3601	It is our part and promise to the Athenians
3602	To speak with Timon.
3603	
3604	Second Senator	At all times alike
3605	Men are not still the same: 'twas time and griefs
3606	That framed him thus: time, with his fairer hand,
3607	Offering the fortunes of his former days,
3608	The former man may make him. Bring us to him,
3609	And chance it as it may.
3610	
3611	FLAVIUS	Here is his cave.
3612	Peace and content be here! Lord Timon! Timon!
3613	Look out, and speak to friends: the Athenians,
3614	By two of their most reverend senate, greet thee:
3615	Speak to them, noble Timon.
3616	
3617	[TIMON comes from his cave]
3618	
3619	TIMON	Thou sun, that comfort'st, burn! Speak, and
3620	be hang'd:
3621	For each true word, a blister! and each false
3622	Be as cauterizing to the root o' the tongue,
3623	Consuming it with speaking!
3624	
3625	First Senator	Worthy Timon,--
3626	
3627	TIMON	Of none but such as you, and you of Timon.
3628	
3629	First Senator	The senators of Athens greet thee, Timon.
3630	
3631	TIMON	I thank them; and would send them back the plague,
3632	Could I but catch it for them.
3633	
3634	First Senator	O, forget
3635	What we are sorry for ourselves in thee.
3636	The senators with one consent of love
3637	Entreat thee back to Athens; who have thought
3638	On special dignities, which vacant lie
3639	For thy best use and wearing.
3640	
3641	Second Senator	They confess
3642	Toward thee forgetfulness too general, gross:
3643	Which now the public body, which doth seldom
3644	Play the recanter, feeling in itself
3645	A lack of Timon's aid, hath sense withal
3646	Of its own fail, restraining aid to Timon;
3647	And send forth us, to make their sorrow'd render,
3648	Together with a recompense more fruitful
3649	Than their offence can weigh down by the dram;
3650	Ay, even such heaps and sums of love and wealth
3651	As shall to thee blot out what wrongs were theirs
3652	And write in thee the figures of their love,
3653	Ever to read them thine.
3654	
3655	TIMON	You witch me in it;
3656	Surprise me to the very brink of tears:
3657	Lend me a fool's heart and a woman's eyes,
3658	And I'll beweep these comforts, worthy senators.
3659	
3660	First Senator	Therefore, so please thee to return with us
3661	And of our Athens, thine and ours, to take
3662	The captainship, thou shalt be met with thanks,
3663	Allow'd with absolute power and thy good name
3664	Live with authority: so soon we shall drive back
3665	Of Alcibiades the approaches wild,
3666	Who, like a boar too savage, doth root up
3667	His country's peace.
3668	
3669	Second Senator	And shakes his threatening sword
3670	Against the walls of Athens.
3671	
3672	First Senator	Therefore, Timon,--
3673	
3674	TIMON	Well, sir, I will; therefore, I will, sir; thus:
3675	If Alcibiades kill my countrymen,
3676	Let Alcibiades know this of Timon,
3677	That Timon cares not. But if be sack fair Athens,
3678	And take our goodly aged men by the beards,
3679	Giving our holy virgins to the stain
3680	Of contumelious, beastly, mad-brain'd war,
3681	Then let him know, and tell him Timon speaks it,
3682	In pity of our aged and our youth,
3683	I cannot choose but tell him, that I care not,
3684	And let him take't at worst; for their knives care not,
3685	While you have throats to answer: for myself,
3686	There's not a whittle in the unruly camp
3687	But I do prize it at my love before
3688	The reverend'st throat in Athens. So I leave you
3689	To the protection of the prosperous gods,
3690	As thieves to keepers.
3691	
3692	FLAVIUS	Stay not, all's in vain.
3693	
3694	TIMON	Why, I was writing of my epitaph;
3695	it will be seen to-morrow: my long sickness
3696	Of health and living now begins to mend,
3697	And nothing brings me all things. Go, live still;
3698	Be Alcibiades your plague, you his,
3699	And last so long enough!
3700	
3701	First Senator	We speak in vain.
3702	
3703	TIMON	But yet I love my country, and am not
3704	One that rejoices in the common wreck,
3705	As common bruit doth put it.
3706	
3707	First Senator	That's well spoke.
3708	
3709	TIMON	Commend me to my loving countrymen,--
3710	
3711	First Senator	These words become your lips as they pass
3712	thorough them.
3713	
3714	Second Senator	And enter in our ears like great triumphers
3715	In their applauding gates.
3716	
3717	TIMON	Commend me to them,
3718	And tell them that, to ease them of their griefs,
3719	Their fears of hostile strokes, their aches, losses,
3720	Their pangs of love, with other incident throes
3721	That nature's fragile vessel doth sustain
3722	In life's uncertain voyage, I will some kindness do them:
3723	I'll teach them to prevent wild Alcibiades' wrath.
3724	
3725	First Senator	I like this well; he will return again.
3726	
3727	TIMON	I have a tree, which grows here in my close,
3728	That mine own use invites me to cut down,
3729	And shortly must I fell it: tell my friends,
3730	Tell Athens, in the sequence of degree
3731	From high to low throughout, that whoso please
3732	To stop affliction, let him take his haste,
3733	Come hither, ere my tree hath felt the axe,
3734	And hang himself. I pray you, do my greeting.
3735	
3736	FLAVIUS	Trouble him no further; thus you still shall find him.
3737	
3738	TIMON	Come not to me again: but say to Athens,
3739	Timon hath made his everlasting mansion
3740	Upon the beached verge of the salt flood;
3741	Who once a day with his embossed froth
3742	The turbulent surge shall cover: thither come,
3743	And let my grave-stone be your oracle.
3744	Lips, let sour words go by and language end:
3745	What is amiss plague and infection mend!
3746	Graves only be men's works and death their gain!
3747	Sun, hide thy beams! Timon hath done his reign.
3748	
3749	[Retires to his cave]
3750	
3751	First Senator	His discontents are unremoveably
3752	Coupled to nature.
3753	
3754	Second Senator	Our hope in him is dead: let us return,
3755	And strain what other means is left unto us
3756	In our dear peril.
3757	
3758	First Senator	                  It requires swift foot.
3759	
3760	[Exeunt]

3765	TIMON OF ATHENS
3766	
3767	
3768	ACT V
3769	
3770	
3771	
3772	SCENE II	Before the walls of Athens.
3773	
3774	
3775	[Enter two Senators and a Messenger]
3776	
3777	First Senator	Thou hast painfully discover'd: are his files
3778	As full as thy report?
3779	
3780	Messenger	have spoke the least:
3781	Besides, his expedition promises
3782	Present approach.
3783	
3784	Second Senator	We stand much hazard, if they bring not Timon.
3785	
3786	Messenger	I met a courier, one mine ancient friend;
3787	Whom, though in general part we were opposed,
3788	Yet our old love made a particular force,
3789	And made us speak like friends: this man was riding
3790	From Alcibiades to Timon's cave,
3791	With letters of entreaty, which imported
3792	His fellowship i' the cause against your city,
3793	In part for his sake moved.
3794	
3795	First Senator	Here come our brothers.
3796	
3797	[Enter the Senators from TIMON]
3798	
3799	Third Senator	No talk of Timon, nothing of him expect.
3800	The enemies' drum is heard, and fearful scouring
3801	Doth choke the air with dust: in, and prepare:
3802	Ours is the fall, I fear; our foes the snare.
3803	
3804	[Exeunt]
3805	
3806

3808	
3809	TIMON OF ATHENS
3810	
3811	
3812	ACT V
3813	
3814	
3815	
3816	SCENE III	The woods. Timon's cave, and a rude tomb seen.
3817	
3818	
3819	[Enter a Soldier, seeking TIMON]
3820	
3821	Soldier	By all description this should be the place.
3822	Who's here? speak, ho! No answer! What is this?
3823	Timon is dead, who hath outstretch'd his span:
3824	Some beast rear'd this; there does not live a man.
3825	Dead, sure; and this his grave. What's on this tomb
3826	I cannot read; the character I'll take with wax:
3827	Our captain hath in every figure skill,
3828	An aged interpreter, though young in days:
3829	Before proud Athens he's set down by this,
3830	Whose fall the mark of his ambition is.
3831	
3832	[Exit]
3833	
3834	
3835	
3836	
3837	TIMON OF ATHENS
3838	
3839	
3840	ACT V
3841	
3842	
3843	
3844	SCENE IV	Before the walls of Athens.
3845	
3846	
3847	[Trumpets sound. Enter ALCIBIADES with his powers]
3848	
3849	ALCIBIADES	Sound to this coward and lascivious town
3850	Our terrible approach.
3851	
3852	[A parley sounded]
3853	
3854	[Enter Senators on the walls]
3855	
3856	Till now you have gone on and fill'd the time
3857	With all licentious measure, making your wills
3858	The scope of justice; till now myself and such
3859	As slept within the shadow of your power
3860	Have wander'd with our traversed arms and breathed
3861	Our sufferance vainly: now the time is flush,
3862	When crouching marrow in the bearer strong
3863	Cries of itself 'No more:' now breathless wrong
3864	Shall sit and pant in your great chairs of ease,
3865	And pursy insolence shall break his wind
3866	With fear and horrid flight.
3867	
3868	First Senator	Noble and young,
3869	When thy first griefs were but a mere conceit,
3870	Ere thou hadst power or we had cause of fear,
3871	We sent to thee, to give thy rages balm,
3872	To wipe out our ingratitude with loves
3873	Above their quantity.
3874	
3875	Second Senator	So did we woo
3876	Transformed Timon to our city's love
3877	By humble message and by promised means:
3878	We were not all unkind, nor all deserve
3879	The common stroke of war.
3880	
3881	First Senator	These walls of ours
3882	Were not erected by their hands from whom
3883	You have received your griefs; nor are they such
3884	That these great towers, trophies and schools
3885	should fall
3886	For private faults in them.
3887	
3888	Second Senator	Nor are they living
3889	Who were the motives that you first went out;
3890	Shame that they wanted cunning, in excess
3891	Hath broke their hearts. March, noble lord,
3892	Into our city with thy banners spread:
3893	By decimation, and a tithed death--
3894	If thy revenges hunger for that food
3895	Which nature loathes--take thou the destined tenth,
3896	And by the hazard of the spotted die
3897	Let die the spotted.
3898	
3899	First Senator	All have not offended;
3900	For those that were, it is not square to take
3901	On those that are, revenges: crimes, like lands,
3902	Are not inherited. Then, dear countryman,
3903	Bring in thy ranks, but leave without thy rage:
3904	Spare thy Athenian cradle and those kin
3905	Which in the bluster of thy wrath must fall
3906	With those that have offended: like a shepherd,
3907	Approach the fold and cull the infected forth,
3908	But kill not all together.
3909	
3910	Second Senator	What thou wilt,
3911	Thou rather shalt enforce it with thy smile
3912	Than hew to't with thy sword.
3913	
3914	First Senator 	Set but thy foot
3915	Against our rampired gates, and they shall ope;
3916	So thou wilt send thy gentle heart before,
3917	To say thou'lt enter friendly.
3918	
3919	Second Senator	Throw thy glove,
3920	Or any token of thine honour else,
3921	That thou wilt use the wars as thy redress
3922	And not as our confusion, all thy powers
3923	Shall make their harbour in our town, till we
3924	Have seal'd thy full desire.
3925	
3926	ALCIBIADES	Then there's my glove;
3927	Descend, and open your uncharged ports:
3928	Those enemies of Timon's and mine own
3929	Whom you yourselves shall set out for reproof
3930	Fall and no more: and, to atone your fears
3931	With my more noble meaning, not a man
3932	Shall pass his quarter, or offend the stream
3933	Of regular justice in your city's bounds,
3934	But shall be render'd to your public laws
3935	At heaviest answer.
3936	
3937	Both	'Tis most nobly spoken.
3938	
3939	ALCIBIADES	Descend, and keep your words.
3940	
3941	[The Senators descend, and open the gates]
3942	
3943	[Enter Soldier]
3944	
3945	Soldier	My noble general, Timon is dead;
3946	Entomb'd upon the very hem o' the sea;
3947	And on his grave-stone this insculpture, which
3948	With wax I brought away, whose soft impression
3949	Interprets for my poor ignorance.
3950	
3951	ALCIBIADES	[Reads the epitaph]  'Here lies a
3952	wretched corse, of wretched soul bereft:
3953	Seek not my name: a plague consume you wicked
3954	caitiffs left!
3955	Here lie I, Timon; who, alive, all living men did hate:
3956	Pass by and curse thy fill, but pass and stay
3957	not here thy gait.'
3958	These well express in thee thy latter spirits:
3959	Though thou abhorr'dst in us our human griefs,
3960	Scorn'dst our brain's flow and those our
3961	droplets which
3962	From niggard nature fall, yet rich conceit
3963	Taught thee to make vast Neptune weep for aye
3964	On thy low grave, on faults forgiven. Dead
3965	Is noble Timon: of whose memory
3966	Hereafter more. Bring me into your city,
3967	And I will use the olive with my sword,
3968	Make war breed peace, make peace stint war, make each
3969	Prescribe to other as each other's leech.
3970	Let our drums strike.
3971	
3972	[Exeunt]

71	[Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
72	
73	SHALLOW	Sir Hugh, persuade me not; I will make a Star-
74	chamber matter of it: if he were twenty Sir John
75	Falstaffs, he shall not abuse Robert Shallow, esquire.
76	
77	SLENDER	In the county of Gloucester, justice of peace and
78	'Coram.'
79	
80	SHALLOW	Ay, cousin Slender, and 'Custalourum.
81	
82	SLENDER	Ay, and 'Rato-lorum' too; and a gentleman born,
83	master parson; who writes himself 'Armigero,' in any
84	bill, warrant, quittance, or obligation, 'Armigero.'
85	
86	SHALLOW	Ay, that I do; and have done any time these three
87	hundred years.
88	
89	SLENDER	All his successors gone before him hath done't; and
90	all his ancestors that come after him may: they may
91	give the dozen white luces in their coat.
92	
93	SHALLOW	It is an old coat.
94	
95	SIR HUGH EVANS	The dozen white louses do become an old coat well;
96	it agrees well, passant; it is a familiar beast to
97	man, and signifies love.
98	
99	SHALLOW	The luce is the fresh fish; the salt fish is an old coat.
100	
101	SLENDER	I may quarter, coz.
102	
103	SHALLOW	You may, by marrying.
104	
105	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is marring indeed, if he quarter it.
106	
107	SHALLOW	Not a whit.
108	
109	SIR HUGH EVANS	Yes, py'r lady; if he has a quarter of your coat,
110	there is but three skirts for yourself, in my
111	simple conjectures: but that is all one. If Sir
112	John Falstaff have committed disparagements unto
113	you, I am of the church, and will be glad to do my
114	benevolence to make atonements and compremises
115	between you.
116	
117	SHALLOW	The council shall bear it; it is a riot.
118	
119	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is not meet the council hear a riot; there is no
120	fear of Got in a riot: the council, look you, shall
121	desire to hear the fear of Got, and not to hear a
122	riot; take your vizaments in that.
123	
124	SHALLOW	Ha! o' my life, if I were young again, the sword
125	should end it.
126	
127	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is petter that friends is the sword, and end it:
128	and there is also another device in my prain, which
129	peradventure prings goot discretions with it: there
130	is Anne Page, which is daughter to Master Thomas
131	Page, which is pretty virginity.
132	
133	SLENDER	Mistress Anne Page? She has brown hair, and speaks
134	small like a woman.
135	
136	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is that fery person for all the orld, as just as
137	you will desire; and seven hundred pounds of moneys,
138	and gold and silver, is her grandsire upon his
139	death's-bed--Got deliver to a joyful resurrections!
140	--give, when she is able to overtake seventeen years
141	old: it were a goot motion if we leave our pribbles
142	and prabbles, and desire a marriage between Master
143	Abraham and Mistress Anne Page.
144	
145	SLENDER	Did her grandsire leave her seven hundred pound?
146	
147	SIR HUGH EVANS	Ay, and her father is make her a petter penny.
148	
149	SLENDER	I know the young gentlewoman; she has good gifts.
150	
151	SIR HUGH EVANS	Seven hundred pounds and possibilities is goot gifts.
152	
153	SHALLOW	Well, let us see honest Master Page. Is Falstaff there?
154	
155	SIR HUGH EVANS	Shall I tell you a lie? I do despise a liar as I do
156	despise one that is false, or as I despise one that
157	is not true. The knight, Sir John, is there; and, I
158	beseech you, be ruled by your well-willers. I will
159	peat the door for Master Page.
160	
161	[Knocks]
162	
163	What, hoa! Got pless your house here!
164	
165	PAGE	[Within]  Who's there?
166	
167	[Enter PAGE]
168	
169	SIR HUGH EVANS	Here is Got's plessing, and your friend, and Justice
170	Shallow; and here young Master Slender, that
171	peradventures shall tell you another tale, if
172	matters grow to your likings.
173	
174	PAGE	I am glad to see your worships well.
175	I thank you for my venison, Master Shallow.
176	
177	SHALLOW	Master Page, I am glad to see you: much good do it
178	your good heart! I wished your venison better; it
179	was ill killed. How doth good Mistress Page?--and I
180	thank you always with my heart, la! with my heart.
181	
182	PAGE	Sir, I thank you.
183	
184	SHALLOW	Sir, I thank you; by yea and no, I do.
185	
186	PAGE	I am glad to see you, good Master Slender.
187	
188	SLENDER	How does your fallow greyhound, sir? I heard say he
189	was outrun on Cotsall.
190	
191	PAGE	It could not be judged, sir.
192	
193	SLENDER	You'll not confess, you'll not confess.
194	
195	SHALLOW	That he will not. 'Tis your fault, 'tis your fault;
196	'tis a good dog.
197	
198	PAGE	A cur, sir.
199	
200	SHALLOW	Sir, he's a good dog, and a fair dog: can there be
201	more said? he is good and fair. Is Sir John
202	Falstaff here?
203	
204	PAGE	Sir, he is within; and I would I could do a good
205	office between you.
206	
207	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is spoke as a Christians ought to speak.
208	
209	SHALLOW	He hath wronged me, Master Page.
210	
211	PAGE	Sir, he doth in some sort confess it.
212	
213	SHALLOW	If it be confessed, it is not redress'd: is not that
214	so, Master Page? He hath wronged me; indeed he
215	hath, at a word, he hath, believe me: Robert
216	Shallow, esquire, saith, he is wronged.
217	
218	PAGE	Here comes Sir John.
219	
220	[Enter FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, NYM, and PISTOL]
221	
222	FALSTAFF	Now, Master Shallow, you'll complain of me to the king?
223	
224	SHALLOW	Knight, you have beaten my men, killed my deer, and
225	broke open my lodge.
226	
227	FALSTAFF	But not kissed your keeper's daughter?
228	
229	SHALLOW	Tut, a pin! this shall be answered.
230	
231	FALSTAFF	I will answer it straight; I have done all this.
232	That is now answered.
233	
234	SHALLOW	The council shall know this.
235	
236	FALSTAFF	'Twere better for you if it were known in counsel:
237	you'll be laughed at.
238	
239	SIR HUGH EVANS	Pauca verba, Sir John; goot worts.
240	
241	FALSTAFF	Good worts! good cabbage. Slender, I broke your
242	head: what matter have you against me?
243	
244	SLENDER	Marry, sir, I have matter in my head against you;
245	and against your cony-catching rascals, Bardolph,
246	Nym, and Pistol.
247	
248	BARDOLPH	You Banbury cheese!
249	
250	SLENDER	Ay, it is no matter.
251	
252	PISTOL	How now, Mephostophilus!
253	
254	SLENDER	Ay, it is no matter.
255	
256	NYM	Slice, I say! pauca, pauca: slice! that's my humour.
257	
258	SLENDER	Where's Simple, my man? Can you tell, cousin?
259	
260	SIR HUGH EVANS	Peace, I pray you. Now let us understand. There is
261	three umpires in this matter, as I understand; that
262	is, Master Page, fidelicet Master Page; and there is
263	myself, fidelicet myself; and the three party is,
264	lastly and finally, mine host of the Garter.
265	
266	PAGE	We three, to hear it and end it between them.
267	
268	SIR HUGH EVANS	Fery goot: I will make a prief of it in my note-
269	book; and we will afterwards ork upon the cause with
270	as great discreetly as we can.
271	
272	FALSTAFF	Pistol!
273	
274	PISTOL	He hears with ears.
275	
276	SIR HUGH EVANS	The tevil and his tam! what phrase is this, 'He
277	hears with ear'? why, it is affectations.
278	
279	FALSTAFF	Pistol, did you pick Master Slender's purse?
280	
281	SLENDER	Ay, by these gloves, did he, or I would I might
282	never come in mine own great chamber again else, of
283	seven groats in mill-sixpences, and two Edward
284	shovel-boards, that cost me two shilling and two
285	pence apiece of Yead Miller, by these gloves.
286	
287	FALSTAFF	Is this true, Pistol?
288	
289	SIR HUGH EVANS	No; it is false, if it is a pick-purse.
290	
291	PISTOL	Ha, thou mountain-foreigner! Sir John and Master mine,
292	I combat challenge of this latten bilbo.
293	Word of denial in thy labras here!
294	Word of denial: froth and scum, thou liest!
295	
296	SLENDER	By these gloves, then, 'twas he.
297	
298	NYM	Be avised, sir, and pass good humours: I will say
299	'marry trap' with you, if you run the nuthook's
300	humour on me; that is the very note of it.
301	
302	SLENDER	By this hat, then, he in the red face had it; for
303	though I cannot remember what I did when you made me
304	drunk, yet I am not altogether an ass.
305	
306	FALSTAFF	What say you, Scarlet and John?
307	
308	BARDOLPH	Why, sir, for my part I say the gentleman had drunk
309	himself out of his five sentences.
310	
311	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is his five senses: fie, what the ignorance is!
312	
313	BARDOLPH	And being fap, sir, was, as they say, cashiered; and
314	so conclusions passed the careires.
315	
316	SLENDER	Ay, you spake in Latin then too; but 'tis no
317	matter: I'll ne'er be drunk whilst I live again,
318	but in honest, civil, godly company, for this trick:
319	if I be drunk, I'll be drunk with those that have
320	the fear of God, and not with drunken knaves.
321	
322	SIR HUGH EVANS	So Got udge me, that is a virtuous mind.
323	
324	FALSTAFF	You hear all these matters denied, gentlemen; you hear it.
325	
326	[Enter ANNE PAGE, with wine; MISTRESS FORD
327	and MISTRESS PAGE, following]
328	
329	PAGE	Nay, daughter, carry the wine in; we'll drink within.
330	
331	[Exit ANNE PAGE]
332	
333	SLENDER	O heaven! this is Mistress Anne Page.
334	
335	PAGE	How now, Mistress Ford!
336	
337	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, by my troth, you are very well met:
338	by your leave, good mistress.
339	
340	[Kisses her]
341	
342	PAGE	Wife, bid these gentlemen welcome. Come, we have a
343	hot venison pasty to dinner: come, gentlemen, I hope
344	we shall drink down all unkindness.
345	
346	[Exeunt all except SHALLOW, SLENDER, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
347	
348	SLENDER	I had rather than forty shillings I had my Book of
349	Songs and Sonnets here.
350	
351	[Enter SIMPLE]
352	
353	How now, Simple! where have you been? I must wait
354	on myself, must I? You have not the Book of Riddles
355	about you, have you?
356	
357	SIMPLE	Book of Riddles! why, did you not lend it to Alice
358	Shortcake upon All-hallowmas last, a fortnight
359	afore Michaelmas?
360	
361	SHALLOW	Come, coz; come, coz; we stay for you. A word with
362	you, coz; marry, this, coz: there is, as 'twere, a
363	tender, a kind of tender, made afar off by Sir Hugh
364	here. Do you understand me?
365	
366	SLENDER	Ay, sir, you shall find me reasonable; if it be so,
367	I shall do that that is reason.
368	
369	SHALLOW	Nay, but understand me.
370	
371	SLENDER	So I do, sir.
372	
373	SIR HUGH EVANS	Give ear to his motions, Master Slender: I will
374	description the matter to you, if you be capacity of it.
375	
376	SLENDER	Nay, I will do as my cousin Shallow says: I pray
377	you, pardon me; he's a justice of peace in his
378	country, simple though I stand here.
379	
380	SIR HUGH EVANS	But that is not the question: the question is
381	concerning your marriage.
382	
383	SHALLOW	Ay, there's the point, sir.
384	
385	SIR HUGH EVANS	Marry, is it; the very point of it; to Mistress Anne Page.
386	
387	SLENDER	Why, if it be so, I will marry her upon any
388	reasonable demands.
389	
390	SIR HUGH EVANS	But can you affection the 'oman? Let us command to
391	know that of your mouth or of your lips; for divers
392	philosophers hold that the lips is parcel of the
393	mouth. Therefore, precisely, can you carry your
394	good will to the maid?
395	
396	SHALLOW	Cousin Abraham Slender, can you love her?
397	
398	SLENDER	I hope, sir, I will do as it shall become one that
399	would do reason.
400	
401	SIR HUGH EVANS	Nay, Got's lords and his ladies! you must speak
402	possitable, if you can carry her your desires
403	towards her.
404	
405	SHALLOW	That you must. Will you, upon good dowry, marry her?
406	
407	SLENDER	I will do a greater thing than that, upon your
408	request, cousin, in any reason.
409	
410	SHALLOW	Nay, conceive me, conceive me, sweet coz: what I do
411	is to pleasure you, coz. Can you love the maid?
412	
413	SLENDER	I will marry her, sir, at your request: but if there
414	be no great love in the beginning, yet heaven may
415	decrease it upon better acquaintance, when we are
416	married and have more occasion to know one another;
417	I hope, upon familiarity will grow more contempt:
418	but if you say, 'Marry her,' I will marry her; that
419	I am freely dissolved, and dissolutely.
420	
421	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is a fery discretion answer; save the fall is in
422	the ort 'dissolutely:' the ort is, according to our
423	meaning, 'resolutely:' his meaning is good.
424	
425	SHALLOW	Ay, I think my cousin meant well.
426	
427	SLENDER	Ay, or else I would I might be hanged, la!
428	
429	SHALLOW	Here comes fair Mistress Anne.
430	
431	[Re-enter ANNE PAGE]
432	
433	Would I were young for your sake, Mistress Anne!
434	
435	ANNE PAGE	The dinner is on the table; my father desires your
436	worships' company.
437	
438	SHALLOW	I will wait on him, fair Mistress Anne.
439	
440	SIR HUGH EVANS	Od's plessed will! I will not be absence at the grace.
441	
442	[Exeunt SHALLOW and SIR HUGH EVANS]
443	
444	ANNE PAGE	Will't please your worship to come in, sir?
445	
446	SLENDER	No, I thank you, forsooth, heartily; I am very well.
447	
448	ANNE PAGE	The dinner attends you, sir.
449	
450	SLENDER	I am not a-hungry, I thank you, forsooth. Go,
451	sirrah, for all you are my man, go wait upon my
452	cousin Shallow.
453	
454	[Exit SIMPLE]
455	
456	A justice of peace sometimes may be beholding to his
457	friend for a man. I keep but three men and a boy
458	yet, till my mother be dead: but what though? Yet I
459	live like a poor gentleman born.
460	
461	ANNE PAGE	I may not go in without your worship: they will not
462	sit till you come.
463	
464	SLENDER	I' faith, I'll eat nothing; I thank you as much as
465	though I did.
466	
467	ANNE PAGE	I pray you, sir, walk in.
468	
469	SLENDER	I had rather walk here, I thank you. I bruised
470	my shin th' other day with playing at sword and
471	dagger with a master of fence; three veneys for a
472	dish of stewed prunes; and, by my troth, I cannot
473	abide the smell of hot meat since. Why do your
474	dogs bark so? be there bears i' the town?
475	
476	ANNE PAGE	I think there are, sir; I heard them talked of.
477	
478	SLENDER	I love the sport well but I shall as soon quarrel at
479	it as any man in England. You are afraid, if you see
480	the bear loose, are you not?
481	
482	ANNE PAGE	Ay, indeed, sir.
483	
484	SLENDER	That's meat and drink to me, now. I have seen
485	Sackerson loose twenty times, and have taken him by
486	the chain; but, I warrant you, the women have so
487	cried and shrieked at it, that it passed: but women,
488	indeed, cannot abide 'em; they are very ill-favored
489	rough things.
490	
491	[Re-enter PAGE]
492	
493	PAGE	Come, gentle Master Slender, come; we stay for you.
494	
495	SLENDER	I'll eat nothing, I thank you, sir.
496	
497	PAGE	By cock and pie, you shall not choose, sir! come, come.
498	
499	SLENDER	Nay, pray you, lead the way.
500	
501	PAGE	Come on, sir.
502	
503	SLENDER	Mistress Anne, yourself shall go first.
504	
505	ANNE PAGE	Not I, sir; pray you, keep on.
506	
507	SLENDER	I'll rather be unmannerly than troublesome.
508	You do yourself wrong, indeed, la!

525	[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS and SIMPLE]
526	
527	SIR HUGH EVANS	Go your ways, and ask of Doctor Caius' house which
528	is the way: and there dwells one Mistress Quickly,
529	which is in the manner of his nurse, or his dry
530	nurse, or his cook, or his laundry, his washer, and
531	his wringer.
532	
533	SIMPLE	Well, sir.
534	
535	SIR HUGH EVANS	Nay, it is petter yet. Give her this letter; for it
536	is a 'oman that altogether's acquaintance with
537	Mistress Anne Page: and the letter is, to desire
538	and require her to solicit your master's desires to
539	Mistress Anne Page. I pray you, be gone: I will
540	make an end of my dinner; there's pippins and cheese to come.

553	
554	SCENE III	A room in the Garter Inn.
555	
556	
557	[Enter FALSTAFF, Host, BARDOLPH, NYM, PISTOL,
558	and ROBIN]
559	
560	FALSTAFF	Mine host of the Garter!
561	
562	Host	What says my bully-rook? speak scholarly and wisely.
563	
564	FALSTAFF	Truly, mine host, I must turn away some of my
565	followers.
566	
567	Host	Discard, bully Hercules; cashier: let them wag; trot, trot.
568	
569	FALSTAFF	I sit at ten pounds a week.
570	
571	Host	Thou'rt an emperor, Caesar, Keisar, and Pheezar. I
572	will entertain Bardolph; he shall draw, he shall
573	tap: said I well, bully Hector?
574	
575	FALSTAFF	Do so, good mine host.
576	
577	Host	I have spoke; let him follow.
578	
579	[To BARDOLPH]
580	
581	Let me see thee froth and lime: I am at a word; follow.
582	
583	[Exit]
584	
585	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, follow him. A tapster is a good trade:
586	an old cloak makes a new jerkin; a withered
587	serving-man a fresh tapster. Go; adieu.
588	
589	BARDOLPH	It is a life that I have desired: I will thrive.
590	
591	PISTOL	O base Hungarian wight! wilt thou the spigot wield?
592	
593	[Exit BARDOLPH]
594	
595	NYM	He was gotten in drink: is not the humour conceited?
596	
597	FALSTAFF	I am glad I am so acquit of this tinderbox: his
598	thefts were too open; his filching was like an
599	unskilful singer; he kept not time.
600	
601	NYM	The good humour is to steal at a minute's rest.
602	
603	PISTOL	'Convey,' the wise it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico
604	for the phrase!
605	
606	FALSTAFF	Well, sirs, I am almost out at heels.
607	
608	PISTOL	Why, then, let kibes ensue.
609	
610	FALSTAFF	There is no remedy; I must cony-catch; I must shift.
611	
612	PISTOL	Young ravens must have food.
613	
614	FALSTAFF	Which of you know Ford of this town?
615	
616	PISTOL	I ken the wight: he is of substance good.
617	
618	FALSTAFF	My honest lads, I will tell you what I am about.
619	
620	PISTOL	Two yards, and more.
621	
622	FALSTAFF	No quips now, Pistol! Indeed, I am in the waist two
623	yards about; but I am now about no waste; I am about
624	thrift. Briefly, I do mean to make love to Ford's
625	wife: I spy entertainment in her; she discourses,
626	she carves, she gives the leer of invitation: I
627	can construe the action of her familiar style; and
628	the hardest voice of her behavior, to be Englished
629	rightly, is, 'I am Sir John Falstaff's.'
630	
631	PISTOL	He hath studied her will, and translated her will,
632	out of honesty into English.
633	
634	NYM	The anchor is deep: will that humour pass?
635	
636	FALSTAFF	Now, the report goes she has all the rule of her
637	husband's purse: he hath a legion of angels.
638	
639	PISTOL	As many devils entertain; and 'To her, boy,' say I.
640	
641	NYM	The humour rises; it is good: humour me the angels.
642	
643	FALSTAFF	I have writ me here a letter to her: and here
644	another to Page's wife, who even now gave me good
645	eyes too, examined my parts with most judicious
646	oeillades; sometimes the beam of her view gilded my
647	foot, sometimes my portly belly.
648	
649	PISTOL	Then did the sun on dunghill shine.
650	
651	NYM	I thank thee for that humour.
652	
653	FALSTAFF	O, she did so course o'er my exteriors with such a
654	greedy intention, that the appetite of her eye did
655	seem to scorch me up like a burning-glass! Here's
656	another letter to her: she bears the purse too; she
657	is a region in Guiana, all gold and bounty. I will
658	be cheater to them both, and they shall be
659	exchequers to me; they shall be my East and West
660	Indies, and I will trade to them both. Go bear thou
661	this letter to Mistress Page; and thou this to
662	Mistress Ford: we will thrive, lads, we will thrive.
663	
664	PISTOL	Shall I Sir Pandarus of Troy become,
665	And by my side wear steel? then, Lucifer take all!
666	
667	NYM	I will run no base humour: here, take the
668	humour-letter: I will keep the havior of reputation.
669	
670	FALSTAFF	[To ROBIN]  Hold, sirrah, bear you these letters tightly;
671	Sail like my pinnace to these golden shores.
672	Rogues, hence, avaunt! vanish like hailstones, go;
673	Trudge, plod away o' the hoof; seek shelter, pack!
674	Falstaff will learn the humour of the age,
675	French thrift, you rogues; myself and skirted page.
676	
677	[Exeunt FALSTAFF and ROBIN]
678	
679	PISTOL	Let vultures gripe thy guts! for gourd and fullam holds,
680	And high and low beguiles the rich and poor:
681	Tester I'll have in pouch when thou shalt lack,
682	Base Phrygian Turk!
683	
684	NYM	I have operations which be humours of revenge.
685	
686	PISTOL	Wilt thou revenge?
687	
688	NYM	By welkin and her star!
689	
690	PISTOL	With wit or steel?
691	
692	NYM	With both the humours, I:
693	I will discuss the humour of this love to Page.
694	
695	PISTOL	     And I to Ford shall eke unfold
696	How Falstaff, varlet vile,
697	His dove will prove, his gold will hold,
698	And his soft couch defile.
699	
700	NYM	My humour shall not cool: I will incense Page to
701	deal with poison; I will possess him with
702	yellowness, for the revolt of mine is dangerous:
703	that is my true humour.
704	
705	PISTOL	Thou art the Mars of malecontents: I second thee; troop on.
706	
707	[Exeunt]

712	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
713	
714	
715	ACT I
716	
717	
718	
719	SCENE IV	A room in DOCTOR CAIUS' house.
720	
721	
722	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, SIMPLE, and RUGBY]
723	
724	MISTRESS QUICKLY	What, John Rugby! I pray thee, go to the casement,
725	and see if you can see my master, Master Doctor
726	Caius, coming. If he do, i' faith, and find any
727	body in the house, here will be an old abusing of
728	God's patience and the king's English.
729	
730	RUGBY	I'll go watch.
731	
732	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Go; and we'll have a posset for't soon at night, in
733	faith, at the latter end of a sea-coal fire.
734	
735	[Exit RUGBY]
736	
737	An honest, willing, kind fellow, as ever servant
738	shall come in house withal, and, I warrant you, no
739	tell-tale nor no breed-bate: his worst fault is,
740	that he is given to prayer; he is something peevish
741	that way: but nobody but has his fault; but let
742	that pass. Peter Simple, you say your name is?
743	
744	SIMPLE	Ay, for fault of a better.
745	
746	MISTRESS QUICKLY	And Master Slender's your master?
747	
748	SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth.
749	
750	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Does he not wear a great round beard, like a
751	glover's paring-knife?
752	
753	SIMPLE	No, forsooth: he hath but a little wee face, with a
754	little yellow beard, a Cain-coloured beard.
755	
756	MISTRESS QUICKLY	A softly-sprighted man, is he not?
757	
758	SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth: but he is as tall a man of his hands
759	as any is between this and his head; he hath fought
760	with a warrener.
761	
762	MISTRESS QUICKLY	How say you? O, I should remember him: does he not
763	hold up his head, as it were, and strut in his gait?
764	
765	SIMPLE	Yes, indeed, does he.
766	
767	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, heaven send Anne Page no worse fortune! Tell
768	Master Parson Evans I will do what I can for your
769	master: Anne is a good girl, and I wish--
770	
771	[Re-enter RUGBY]
772	
773	RUGBY	Out, alas! here comes my master.
774	
775	MISTRESS QUICKLY	We shall all be shent. Run in here, good young man;
776	go into this closet: he will not stay long.
777	
778	[Shuts SIMPLE in the closet]
779	
780	What, John Rugby! John! what, John, I say!
781	Go, John, go inquire for my master; I doubt
782	he be not well, that he comes not home.
783	
784	[Singing]
785	
786	And down, down, adown-a, &c.
787	
788	[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]
789	
790	DOCTOR CAIUS	Vat is you sing? I do not like des toys. Pray you,
791	go and vetch me in my closet un boitier vert, a box,
792	a green-a box: do intend vat I speak? a green-a box.
793	
794	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; I'll fetch it you.
795	
796	[Aside]
797	
798	I am glad he went not in himself: if he had found
799	the young man, he would have been horn-mad.
800	
801	DOCTOR CAIUS	Fe, fe, fe, fe! ma foi, il fait fort chaud. Je
802	m'en vais a la cour--la grande affaire.
803	
804	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Is it this, sir?
805	
806	DOCTOR CAIUS	Oui; mette le au mon pocket: depeche, quickly. Vere
807	is dat knave Rugby?
808	
809	MISTRESS QUICKLY	What, John Rugby! John!
810	
811	RUGBY	Here, sir!
812	
813	DOCTOR CAIUS	You are John Rugby, and you are Jack Rugby. Come,
814	take-a your rapier, and come after my heel to the court.
815	
816	RUGBY	'Tis ready, sir, here in the porch.
817	
818	DOCTOR CAIUS	By my trot, I tarry too long. Od's me!
819	Qu'ai-j'oublie! dere is some simples in my closet,
820	dat I vill not for the varld I shall leave behind.
821	
822	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay me, he'll find the young man here, and be mad!
823	
824	DOCTOR CAIUS	O diable, diable! vat is in my closet? Villain! larron!
825	
826	[Pulling SIMPLE out]
827	
828	Rugby, my rapier!
829	
830	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good master, be content.
831	
832	DOCTOR CAIUS	Wherefore shall I be content-a?
833	
834	MISTRESS QUICKLY	The young man is an honest man.
835	
836	DOCTOR CAIUS	What shall de honest man do in my closet? dere is
837	no honest man dat shall come in my closet.
838	
839	MISTRESS QUICKLY	I beseech you, be not so phlegmatic. Hear the truth
840	of it: he came of an errand to me from Parson Hugh.
841	
842	DOCTOR CAIUS	Vell.
843	
844	SIMPLE	Ay, forsooth; to desire her to--
845	
846	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Peace, I pray you.
847	
848	DOCTOR CAIUS	Peace-a your tongue. Speak-a your tale.
849	
850	SIMPLE	To desire this honest gentlewoman, your maid, to
851	speak a good word to Mistress Anne Page for my
852	master in the way of marriage.
853	
854	MISTRESS QUICKLY	This is all, indeed, la! but I'll ne'er put my
855	finger in the fire, and need not.
856	
857	DOCTOR CAIUS	Sir Hugh send-a you? Rugby, baille me some paper.
858	Tarry you a little-a while.
859	
860	[Writes]
861	
862	MISTRESS QUICKLY	[Aside to SIMPLE]  I am glad he is so quiet: if he
863	had been thoroughly moved, you should have heard him
864	so loud and so melancholy. But notwithstanding,
865	man, I'll do you your master what good I can: and
866	the very yea and the no is, the French doctor, my
867	master,--I may call him my master, look you, for I
868	keep his house; and I wash, wring, brew, bake,
869	scour, dress meat and drink, make the beds and do
870	all myself,--
871	
872	SIMPLE	[Aside to MISTRESS QUICKLY]  'Tis a great charge to
873	come under one body's hand.
874	
875	MISTRESS QUICKLY	[Aside to SIMPLE]  Are you avised o' that? you
876	shall find it a great charge: and to be up early
877	and down late; but notwithstanding,--to tell you in
878	your ear; I would have no words of it,--my master
879	himself is in love with Mistress Anne Page: but
880	notwithstanding that, I know Anne's mind,--that's
881	neither here nor there.
882	
883	DOCTOR CAIUS	You jack'nape, give-a this letter to Sir Hugh; by
884	gar, it is a shallenge: I will cut his troat in dee
885	park; and I will teach a scurvy jack-a-nape priest
886	to meddle or make. You may be gone; it is not good
887	you tarry here. By gar, I will cut all his two
888	stones; by gar, he shall not have a stone to throw
889	at his dog:
890	
891	[Exit SIMPLE]
892	
893	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Alas, he speaks but for his friend.
894	
895	DOCTOR CAIUS	It is no matter-a ver dat: do not you tell-a me
896	dat I shall have Anne Page for myself? By gar, I
897	vill kill de Jack priest; and I have appointed mine
898	host of de Jarteer to measure our weapon. By gar, I
899	will myself have Anne Page.
900	
901	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sir, the maid loves you, and all shall be well. We
902	must give folks leave to prate: what, the good-jer!
903	
904	DOCTOR CAIUS	Rugby, come to the court with me. By gar, if I have
905	not Anne Page, I shall turn your head out of my
906	door. Follow my heels, Rugby.
907	
908	[Exeunt DOCTOR CAIUS and RUGBY]
909	
910	MISTRESS QUICKLY	You shall have An fool's-head of your own. No, I
911	know Anne's mind for that: never a woman in Windsor
912	knows more of Anne's mind than I do; nor can do more
913	than I do with her, I thank heaven.
914	
915	FENTON	[Within]  Who's within there? ho!
916	
917	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Who's there, I trow! Come near the house, I pray you.
918	
919	[Enter FENTON]
920	
921	FENTON	How now, good woman? how dost thou?
922	
923	MISTRESS QUICKLY	The better that it pleases your good worship to ask.
924	
925	FENTON	What news? how does pretty Mistress Anne?
926	
927	MISTRESS QUICKLY	In truth, sir, and she is pretty, and honest, and
928	gentle; and one that is your friend, I can tell you
929	that by the way; I praise heaven for it.
930	
931	FENTON	Shall I do any good, thinkest thou? shall I not lose my suit?
932	
933	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Troth, sir, all is in his hands above: but
934	notwithstanding, Master Fenton, I'll be sworn on a
935	book, she loves you. Have not your worship a wart
936	above your eye?
937	
938	FENTON	Yes, marry, have I; what of that?
939	
940	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, thereby hangs a tale: good faith, it is such
941	another Nan; but, I detest, an honest maid as ever
942	broke bread: we had an hour's talk of that wart. I
943	shall never laugh but in that maid's company! But
944	indeed she is given too much to allicholy and
945	musing: but for you--well, go to.
946	
947	FENTON	Well, I shall see her to-day. Hold, there's money
948	for thee; let me have thy voice in my behalf: if
949	thou seest her before me, commend me.
950	
951	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Will I? i'faith, that we will; and I will tell your
952	worship more of the wart the next time we have
953	confidence; and of other wooers.
954	
955	FENTON	Well, farewell; I am in great haste now.
956	
957	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Farewell to your worship.
958	
959	[Exit FENTON]
960	
961	Truly, an honest gentleman: but Anne loves him not;
962	for I know Anne's mind as well as another does. Out
963	upon't! what have I forgot?
964	
965	[Exit]

970	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
971	
972	
973	ACT II
974	
975	
976	
977	SCENE I	Before PAGE'S house.
978	
979	
980	[Enter MISTRESS PAGE, with a letter]
981	
982	MISTRESS PAGE	What, have I scaped love-letters in the holiday-
983	time of my beauty, and am I now a subject for them?
984	Let me see.
985	
986	[Reads]
987	
988	'Ask me no reason why I love you; for though
989	Love use Reason for his physician, he admits him
990	not for his counsellor. You are not young, no more
991	am I; go to then, there's sympathy: you are merry,
992	so am I; ha, ha! then there's more sympathy: you
993	love sack, and so do I; would you desire better
994	sympathy? Let it suffice thee, Mistress Page,--at
995	the least, if the love of soldier can suffice,--
996	that I love thee. I will not say, pity me; 'tis
997	not a soldier-like phrase: but I say, love me. By me,
998	Thine own true knight,
999	By day or night,
1000	Or any kind of light,
1001	With all his might
1002	For thee to fight,    JOHN FALSTAFF'
1003	What a Herod of Jewry is this! O wicked
1004	world! One that is well-nigh worn to pieces with
1005	age to show himself a young gallant! What an
1006	unweighed behavior hath this Flemish drunkard
1007	picked--with the devil's name!--out of my
1008	conversation, that he dares in this manner assay me?
1009	Why, he hath not been thrice in my company! What
1010	should I say to him? I was then frugal of my
1011	mirth: Heaven forgive me! Why, I'll exhibit a bill
1012	in the parliament for the putting down of men. How
1013	shall I be revenged on him? for revenged I will be,
1014	as sure as his guts are made of puddings.
1015	
1016	[Enter MISTRESS FORD]
1017	
1018	MISTRESS FORD	Mistress Page! trust me, I was going to your house.
1019	
1020	MISTRESS PAGE	And, trust me, I was coming to you. You look very
1021	ill.
1022	
1023	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, I'll ne'er believe that; I have to show to the contrary.
1024	
1025	MISTRESS PAGE	Faith, but you do, in my mind.
1026	
1027	MISTRESS FORD	Well, I do then; yet I say I could show you to the
1028	contrary. O Mistress Page, give me some counsel!
1029	
1030	MISTRESS PAGE	What's the matter, woman?
1031	
1032	MISTRESS FORD	O woman, if it were not for one trifling respect, I
1033	could come to such honour!
1034	
1035	MISTRESS PAGE	Hang the trifle, woman! take the honour. What is
1036	it? dispense with trifles; what is it?
1037	
1038	MISTRESS FORD	If I would but go to hell for an eternal moment or so,
1039	I could be knighted.
1040	
1041	MISTRESS PAGE	What? thou liest! Sir Alice Ford! These knights
1042	will hack; and so thou shouldst not alter the
1043	article of thy gentry.
1044	
1045	MISTRESS FORD	We burn daylight: here, read, read; perceive how I
1046	might be knighted. I shall think the worse of fat
1047	men, as long as I have an eye to make difference of
1048	men's liking: and yet he would not swear; praised
1049	women's modesty; and gave such orderly and
1050	well-behaved reproof to all uncomeliness, that I
1051	would have sworn his disposition would have gone to
1052	the truth of his words; but they do no more adhere
1053	and keep place together than the Hundredth Psalm to
1054	the tune of 'Green Sleeves.' What tempest, I trow,
1055	threw this whale, with so many tuns of oil in his
1056	belly, ashore at Windsor? How shall I be revenged
1057	on him? I think the best way were to entertain him
1058	with hope, till the wicked fire of lust have melted
1059	him in his own grease. Did you ever hear the like?
1060	
1061	MISTRESS PAGE	Letter for letter, but that the name of Page and
1062	Ford differs! To thy great comfort in this mystery
1063	of ill opinions, here's the twin-brother of thy
1064	letter: but let thine inherit first; for, I
1065	protest, mine never shall. I warrant he hath a
1066	thousand of these letters, writ with blank space for
1067	different names--sure, more,--and these are of the
1068	second edition: he will print them, out of doubt;
1069	for he cares not what he puts into the press, when
1070	he would put us two. I had rather be a giantess,
1071	and lie under Mount Pelion. Well, I will find you
1072	twenty lascivious turtles ere one chaste man.
1073	
1074	MISTRESS FORD	Why, this is the very same; the very hand, the very
1075	words. What doth he think of us?
1076	
1077	MISTRESS PAGE	Nay, I know not: it makes me almost ready to
1078	wrangle with mine own honesty. I'll entertain
1079	myself like one that I am not acquainted withal;
1080	for, sure, unless he know some strain in me, that I
1081	know not myself, he would never have boarded me in this fury.
1082	
1083	MISTRESS FORD	'Boarding,' call you it? I'll be sure to keep him
1084	above deck.
1085	
1086	MISTRESS PAGE	So will I	if he come under my hatches, I'll never
1087	to sea again. Let's be revenged on him: let's
1088	appoint him a meeting; give him a show of comfort in
1089	his suit and lead him on with a fine-baited delay,
1090	till he hath pawned his horses to mine host of the Garter.
1091	
1092	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, I will consent to act any villany against him,
1093	that may not sully the chariness of our honesty. O,
1094	that my husband saw this letter! it would give
1095	eternal food to his jealousy.
1096	
1097	MISTRESS PAGE	Why, look where he comes; and my good man too: he's
1098	as far from jealousy as I am from giving him cause;
1099	and that I hope is an unmeasurable distance.
1100	
1101	MISTRESS FORD	You are the happier woman.
1102	
1103	MISTRESS PAGE	Let's consult together against this greasy knight.
1104	Come hither.
1105	
1106	[They retire]
1107	
1108	[Enter FORD with PISTOL, and PAGE with NYM]
1109	
1110	FORD	Well, I hope it be not so.
1111	
1112	PISTOL	Hope is a curtal dog in some affairs:
1113	Sir John affects thy wife.
1114	
1115	FORD	Why, sir, my wife is not young.
1116	
1117	PISTOL	He wooes both high and low, both rich and poor,
1118	Both young and old, one with another, Ford;
1119	He loves the gallimaufry: Ford, perpend.
1120	
1121	FORD	Love my wife!
1122	
1123	PISTOL	With liver burning hot. Prevent, or go thou,
1124	Like Sir Actaeon he, with Ringwood at thy heels:
1125	O, odious is the name!
1126	
1127	FORD	What name, sir?
1128	
1129	PISTOL	The horn, I say. Farewell.
1130	Take heed, have open eye, for thieves do foot by night:
1131	Take heed, ere summer comes or cuckoo-birds do sing.
1132	Away, Sir Corporal Nym!
1133	Believe it, Page; he speaks sense.
1134	
1135	[Exit]
1136	
1137	FORD	[Aside]  I will be patient; I will find out this.
1138	
1139	NYM	[To PAGE]  And this is true; I like not the humour
1140	of lying. He hath wronged me in some humours: I
1141	should have borne the humoured letter to her; but I
1142	have a sword and it shall bite upon my necessity.
1143	He loves your wife; there's the short and the long.
1144	My name is Corporal Nym; I speak and I avouch; 'tis
1145	true: my name is Nym and Falstaff loves your wife.
1146	Adieu. I love not the humour of bread and cheese,
1147	and there's the humour of it. Adieu.
1148	
1149	[Exit]
1150	
1151	PAGE	'The humour of it,' quoth a'! here's a fellow
1152	frights English out of his wits.
1153	
1154	FORD	I will seek out Falstaff.
1155	
1156	PAGE	I never heard such a drawling, affecting rogue.
1157	
1158	FORD	If I do find it: well.
1159	
1160	PAGE	I will not believe such a Cataian, though the priest
1161	o' the town commended him for a true man.
1162	
1163	FORD	'Twas a good sensible fellow: well.
1164	
1165	PAGE	How now, Meg!
1166	
1167	[MISTRESS PAGE and MISTRESS FORD come forward]
1168	
1169	MISTRESS PAGE	Whither go you, George? Hark you.
1170	
1171	MISTRESS FORD	How now, sweet Frank! why art thou melancholy?
1172	
1173	FORD	I melancholy! I am not melancholy. Get you home, go.
1174	
1175	MISTRESS FORD	Faith, thou hast some crotchets in thy head. Now,
1176	will you go, Mistress Page?
1177	
1178	MISTRESS PAGE	Have with you. You'll come to dinner, George.
1179	
1180	[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]
1181	
1182	Look who comes yonder: she shall be our messenger
1183	to this paltry knight.
1184	
1185	MISTRESS FORD	[Aside to MISTRESS PAGE]  Trust me, I thought on her:
1186	she'll fit it.
1187	
1188	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
1189	
1190	MISTRESS PAGE	You are come to see my daughter Anne?
1191	
1192	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; and, I pray, how does good Mistress Anne?
1193	
1194	MISTRESS PAGE	Go in with us and see: we have an hour's talk with
1195	you.
1196	
1197	[Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]
1198	
1199	PAGE	How now, Master Ford!
1200	
1201	FORD	You heard what this knave told me, did you not?
1202	
1203	PAGE	Yes: and you heard what the other told me?
1204	
1205	FORD	Do you think there is truth in them?
1206	
1207	PAGE	Hang 'em, slaves! I do not think the knight would
1208	offer it: but these that accuse him in his intent
1209	towards our wives are a yoke of his discarded men;
1210	very rogues, now they be out of service.
1211	
1212	FORD	Were they his men?
1213	
1214	PAGE	Marry, were they.
1215	
1216	FORD	I like it never the better for that. Does he lie at
1217	the Garter?
1218	
1219	PAGE	Ay, marry, does he. If he should intend this voyage
1220	towards my wife, I would turn her loose to him; and
1221	what he gets more of her than sharp words, let it
1222	lie on my head.
1223	
1224	FORD	I do not misdoubt my wife; but I would be loath to
1225	turn them together. A man may be too confident: I
1226	would have nothing lie on my head: I cannot be thus satisfied.
1227	
1228	PAGE	Look where my ranting host of the Garter comes:
1229	there is either liquor in his pate or money in his
1230	purse when he looks so merrily.
1231	
1232	[Enter Host]
1233	
1234	How now, mine host!
1235	
1236	Host	How now, bully-rook! thou'rt a gentleman.
1237	Cavaleiro-justice, I say!
1238	
1239	[Enter SHALLOW]
1240	
1241	SHALLOW	I follow, mine host, I follow. Good even and
1242	twenty, good Master Page! Master Page, will you go
1243	with us? we have sport in hand.
1244	
1245	Host	Tell him, cavaleiro-justice; tell him, bully-rook.
1246	
1247	SHALLOW	Sir, there is a fray to be fought between Sir Hugh
1248	the Welsh priest and Caius the French doctor.
1249	
1250	FORD	Good mine host o' the Garter, a word with you.
1251	
1252	[Drawing him aside]
1253	
1254	Host	What sayest thou, my bully-rook?
1255	
1256	SHALLOW	[To PAGE]  Will you go with us to behold it? My
1257	merry host hath had the measuring of their weapons;
1258	and, I think, hath appointed them contrary places;
1259	for, believe me, I hear the parson is no jester.
1260	Hark, I will tell you what our sport shall be.
1261	
1262	[They converse apart]
1263	
1264	Host	Hast thou no suit against my knight, my
1265	guest-cavaleire?
1266	
1267	FORD	None, I protest: but I'll give you a pottle of
1268	burnt sack to give me recourse to him and tell him
1269	my name is Brook; only for a jest.
1270	
1271	Host	My hand, bully; thou shalt have egress and regress;
1272	--said I well?--and thy name shall be Brook. It is
1273	a merry knight. Will you go, An-heires?
1274	
1275	SHALLOW	Have with you, mine host.
1276	
1277	PAGE	I have heard the Frenchman hath good skill in
1278	his rapier.
1279	
1280	SHALLOW	Tut, sir, I could have told you more. In these times
1281	you stand on distance, your passes, stoccadoes, and
1282	I know not what: 'tis the heart, Master Page; 'tis
1283	here, 'tis here. I have seen the time, with my long
1284	sword I would have made you four tall fellows skip like rats.
1285	
1286	Host	Here, boys, here, here! shall we wag?
1287	
1288	PAGE	Have with you. I would rather hear them scold than fight.
1289	
1290	[Exeunt Host, SHALLOW, and PAGE]
1291	
1292	FORD	Though Page be a secure fool, an stands so firmly
1293	on his wife's frailty, yet I cannot put off my
1294	opinion so easily: she was in his company at Page's
1295	house; and what they made there, I know not. Well,
1296	I will look further into't: and I have a disguise
1297	to sound Falstaff. If I find her honest, I lose not
1298	my labour; if she be otherwise, 'tis labour well bestowed.

1305	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
1306	
1307	
1308	ACT II
1309	
1310	
1311	
1312	SCENE II	A room in the Garter Inn.
1313	
1314	
1315	[Enter FALSTAFF and PISTOL]
1316	
1317	
1318	FALSTAFF	I will not lend thee a penny.
1319	
1320	PISTOL	Why, then the world's mine oyster.
1321	Which I with sword will open.
1322	
1323	FALSTAFF	Not a penny. I have been content, sir, you should
1324	lay my countenance to pawn; I have grated upon my
1325	good friends for three reprieves for you and your
1326	coach-fellow Nym; or else you had looked through
1327	the grate, like a geminy of baboons. I am damned in
1328	hell for swearing to gentlemen my friends, you were
1329	good soldiers and tall fellows; and when Mistress
1330	Bridget lost the handle of her fan, I took't upon
1331	mine honour thou hadst it not.
1332	
1333	PISTOL	Didst not thou share? hadst thou not fifteen pence?
1334	
1335	FALSTAFF	Reason, you rogue, reason: thinkest thou I'll
1336	endanger my soul gratis? At a word, hang no more
1337	about me, I am no gibbet for you. Go. A short knife
1338	and a throng! To your manor of Pickt-hatch! Go.
1339	You'll not bear a letter for me, you rogue! you
1340	stand upon your honour! Why, thou unconfinable
1341	baseness, it is as much as I can do to keep the
1342	terms of my honour precise: I, I, I myself
1343	sometimes, leaving the fear of God on the left hand
1344	and hiding mine honour in my necessity, am fain to
1345	shuffle, to hedge and to lurch; and yet you, rogue,
1346	will ensconce your rags, your cat-a-mountain
1347	looks, your red-lattice phrases, and your
1348	bold-beating oaths, under the shelter of your
1349	honour! You will not do it, you!
1350	
1351	PISTOL	I do relent: what would thou more of man?
1352	
1353	[Enter ROBIN]
1354	
1355	ROBIN	Sir, here's a woman would speak with you.
1356	
1357	FALSTAFF	Let her approach.
1358	
1359	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
1360	
1361	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Give your worship good morrow.
1362	
1363	FALSTAFF	Good morrow, good wife.
1364	
1365	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Not so, an't please your worship.
1366	
1367	FALSTAFF	Good maid, then.
1368	
1369	MISTRESS QUICKLY	I'll be sworn,
1370	As my mother was, the first hour I was born.
1371	
1372	FALSTAFF	I do believe the swearer. What with me?
1373	
1374	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Shall I vouchsafe your worship a word or two?
1375	
1376	FALSTAFF	Two thousand, fair woman: and I'll vouchsafe thee
1377	the hearing.
1378	
1379	MISTRESS QUICKLY	There is one Mistress Ford, sir:--I pray, come a
1380	little nearer this ways:--I myself dwell with master
1381	Doctor Caius,--
1382	
1383	FALSTAFF	Well, on: Mistress Ford, you say,--
1384	
1385	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Your worship says very true: I pray your worship,
1386	come a little nearer this ways.
1387	
1388	FALSTAFF	I warrant thee, nobody hears; mine own people, mine
1389	own people.
1390	
1391	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Are they so? God bless them and make them his servants!
1392	
1393	FALSTAFF	Well, Mistress Ford; what of her?
1394	
1395	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Why, sir, she's a good creature. Lord Lord! your
1396	worship's a wanton! Well, heaven forgive you and all
1397	of us, I pray!
1398	
1399	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford; come, Mistress Ford,--
1400	
1401	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, this is the short and the long of it; you
1402	have brought her into such a canaries as 'tis
1403	wonderful. The best courtier of them all, when the
1404	court lay at Windsor, could never have brought her
1405	to such a canary. Yet there has been knights, and
1406	lords, and gentlemen, with their coaches, I warrant
1407	you, coach after coach, letter after letter, gift
1408	after gift; smelling so sweetly, all musk, and so
1409	rushling, I warrant you, in silk and gold; and in
1410	such alligant terms; and in such wine and sugar of
1411	the best and the fairest, that would have won any
1412	woman's heart; and, I warrant you, they could never
1413	get an eye-wink of her: I had myself twenty angels
1414	given me this morning; but I defy all angels, in
1415	any such sort, as they say, but in the way of
1416	honesty: and, I warrant you, they could never get
1417	her so much as sip on a cup with the proudest of
1418	them all: and yet there has been earls, nay, which
1419	is more, pensioners; but, I warrant you, all is one with her.
1420	
1421	FALSTAFF	But what says she to me? be brief, my good
1422	she-Mercury.
1423	
1424	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, she hath received your letter, for the which
1425	she thanks you a thousand times; and she gives you
1426	to notify that her husband will be absence from his
1427	house between ten and eleven.
1428	
1429	FALSTAFF	Ten and eleven?
1430	
1431	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, forsooth; and then you may come and see the
1432	picture, she says, that you wot of: Master Ford,
1433	her husband, will be from home. Alas! the sweet
1434	woman leads an ill life with him: he's a very
1435	jealousy man: she leads a very frampold life with
1436	him, good heart.
1437	
1438	FALSTAFF	Ten and eleven. Woman, commend me to her; I will
1439	not fail her.
1440	
1441	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Why, you say well. But I have another messenger to
1442	your worship. Mistress Page hath her hearty
1443	commendations to you too: and let me tell you in
1444	your ear, she's as fartuous a civil modest wife, and
1445	one, I tell you, that will not miss you morning nor
1446	evening prayer, as any is in Windsor, whoe'er be the
1447	other: and she bade me tell your worship that her
1448	husband is seldom from home; but she hopes there
1449	will come a time. I never knew a woman so dote upon
1450	a man: surely I think you have charms, la; yes, in truth.
1451	
1452	FALSTAFF	Not I, I assure thee: setting the attractions of my
1453	good parts aside I have no other charms.
1454	
1455	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Blessing on your heart for't!
1456	
1457	FALSTAFF	But, I pray thee, tell me this: has Ford's wife and
1458	Page's wife acquainted each other how they love me?
1459	
1460	MISTRESS QUICKLY	That were a jest indeed! they have not so little
1461	grace, I hope: that were a trick indeed! but
1462	Mistress Page would desire you to send her your
1463	little page, of all loves: her husband has a
1464	marvellous infection to the little page; and truly
1465	Master Page is an honest man. Never a wife in
1466	Windsor leads a better life than she does: do what
1467	she will, say what she will, take all, pay all, go
1468	to bed when she list, rise when she list, all is as
1469	she will: and truly she deserves it; for if there
1470	be a kind woman in Windsor, she is one. You must
1471	send her your page; no remedy.
1472	
1473	FALSTAFF	Why, I will.
1474	
1475	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Nay, but do so, then: and, look you, he may come and
1476	go between you both; and in any case have a
1477	nay-word, that you may know one another's mind, and
1478	the boy never need to understand any thing; for
1479	'tis not good that children should know any
1480	wickedness: old folks, you know, have discretion,
1481	as they say, and know the world.
1482	
1483	FALSTAFF	Fare thee well: commend me to them both: there's
1484	my purse; I am yet thy debtor. Boy, go along with
1485	this woman.
1486	
1487	[Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY and ROBIN]
1488	
1489	This news distracts me!
1490	
1491	PISTOL	This punk is one of Cupid's carriers:
1492	Clap on more sails; pursue; up with your fights:
1493	Give fire: she is my prize, or ocean whelm them all!
1494	
1495	[Exit]
1496	
1497	FALSTAFF	Sayest thou so, old Jack? go thy ways; I'll make
1498	more of thy old body than I have done. Will they
1499	yet look after thee? Wilt thou, after the expense
1500	of so much money, be now a gainer? Good body, I
1501	thank thee. Let them say 'tis grossly done; so it be
1502	fairly done, no matter.
1503	
1504	[Enter BARDOLPH]
1505	
1506	BARDOLPH	Sir John, there's one Master Brook below would fain
1507	speak with you, and be acquainted with you; and hath
1508	sent your worship a morning's draught of sack.
1509	
1510	FALSTAFF	Brook is his name?
1511	
1512	BARDOLPH	Ay, sir.
1513	
1514	FALSTAFF	Call him in.
1515	
1516	[Exit BARDOLPH]
1517	
1518	Such Brooks are welcome to me, that o'erflow such
1519	liquor. Ah, ha! Mistress Ford and Mistress Page
1520	have I encompassed you? go to; via!
1521	
1522	[Re-enter BARDOLPH, with FORD disguised]
1523	
1524	FORD	Bless you, sir!
1525	
1526	FALSTAFF	And you, sir! Would you speak with me?
1527	
1528	FORD	I make bold to press with so little preparation upon
1529	you.
1530	
1531	FALSTAFF	You're welcome. What's your will? Give us leave, drawer.
1532	
1533	[Exit BARDOLPH]
1534	
1535	FORD	Sir, I am a gentleman that have spent much; my name is Brook.
1536	
1537	FALSTAFF	Good Master Brook, I desire more acquaintance of you.
1538	
1539	FORD	Good Sir John, I sue for yours: not to charge you;
1540	for I must let you understand I think myself in
1541	better plight for a lender than you are: the which
1542	hath something embolden'd me to this unseasoned
1543	intrusion; for they say, if money go before, all
1544	ways do lie open.
1545	
1546	FALSTAFF	Money is a good soldier, sir, and will on.
1547	
1548	FORD	Troth, and I have a bag of money here troubles me:
1549	if you will help to bear it, Sir John, take all, or
1550	half, for easing me of the carriage.
1551	
1552	FALSTAFF	Sir, I know not how I may deserve to be your porter.
1553	
1554	FORD	I will tell you, sir, if you will give me the hearing.
1555	
1556	FALSTAFF	Speak, good Master Brook: I shall be glad to be
1557	your servant.
1558	
1559	FORD	Sir, I hear you are a scholar,--I will be brief
1560	with you,--and you have been a man long known to me,
1561	though I had never so good means, as desire, to make
1562	myself acquainted with you. I shall discover a
1563	thing to you, wherein I must very much lay open mine
1564	own imperfection: but, good Sir John, as you have
1565	one eye upon my follies, as you hear them unfolded,
1566	turn another into the register of your own; that I
1567	may pass with a reproof the easier, sith you
1568	yourself know how easy it is to be such an offender.
1569	
1570	FALSTAFF	Very well, sir; proceed.
1571	
1572	FORD	There is a gentlewoman in this town; her husband's
1573	name is Ford.
1574	
1575	FALSTAFF	Well, sir.
1576	
1577	FORD	I have long loved her, and, I protest to you,
1578	bestowed much on her; followed her with a doting
1579	observance; engrossed opportunities to meet her;
1580	fee'd every slight occasion that could but niggardly
1581	give me sight of her; not only bought many presents
1582	to give her, but have given largely to many to know
1583	what she would have given; briefly, I have pursued
1584	her as love hath pursued me; which hath been on the
1585	wing of all occasions. But whatsoever I have
1586	merited, either in my mind or, in my means, meed,
1587	I am sure, I have received none; unless experience
1588	be a jewel that I have purchased at an infinite
1589	rate, and that hath taught me to say this:
1590	
1591	'Love like a shadow flies when substance love pursues;
1592	Pursuing that that flies, and flying what pursues.'
1593	
1594	FALSTAFF	Have you received no promise of satisfaction at her hands?
1595	
1596	FORD	Never.
1597	
1598	FALSTAFF	Have you importuned her to such a purpose?
1599	
1600	FORD	Never.
1601	
1602	FALSTAFF	Of what quality was your love, then?
1603	
1604	FORD	Like a fair house built on another man's ground; so
1605	that I have lost my edifice by mistaking the place
1606	where I erected it.
1607	
1608	FALSTAFF	To what purpose have you unfolded this to me?
1609	
1610	FORD	When I have told you that, I have told you all.
1611	Some say, that though she appear honest to me, yet in
1612	other places she enlargeth her mirth so far that
1613	there is shrewd construction made of her. Now, Sir
1614	John, here is the heart of my purpose: you are a
1615	gentleman of excellent breeding, admirable
1616	discourse, of great admittance, authentic in your
1617	place and person, generally allowed for your many
1618	war-like, court-like, and learned preparations.
1619	
1620	FALSTAFF	O, sir!
1621	
1622	FORD	Believe it, for you know it. There is money; spend
1623	it, spend it; spend more; spend all I have; only
1624	give me so much of your time in exchange of it, as
1625	to lay an amiable siege to the honesty of this
1626	Ford's wife: use your art of wooing; win her to
1627	consent to you: if any man may, you may as soon as
1628	any.
1629	
1630	FALSTAFF	Would it apply well to the vehemency of your
1631	affection, that I should win what you would enjoy?
1632	Methinks you prescribe to yourself very preposterously.
1633	
1634	FORD	O, understand my drift. She dwells so securely on
1635	the excellency of her honour, that the folly of my
1636	soul dares not present itself: she is too bright to
1637	be looked against. Now, could I could come to her
1638	with any detection in my hand, my desires had
1639	instance and argument to commend themselves: I
1640	could drive her then from the ward of her purity,
1641	her reputation, her marriage-vow, and a thousand
1642	other her defences, which now are too too strongly
1643	embattled against me. What say you to't, Sir John?
1644	
1645	FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will first make bold with your
1646	money; next, give me your hand; and last, as I am a
1647	gentleman, you shall, if you will, enjoy Ford's wife.
1648	
1649	FORD	O good sir!
1650	
1651	FALSTAFF	I say you shall.
1652	
1653	FORD	Want no money, Sir John; you shall want none.
1654	
1655	FALSTAFF	Want no Mistress Ford, Master Brook; you shall want
1656	none. I shall be with her, I may tell you, by her
1657	own appointment; even as you came in to me, her
1658	assistant or go-between parted from me: I say I
1659	shall be with her between ten and eleven; for at
1660	that time the jealous rascally knave her husband
1661	will be forth. Come you to me at night; you shall
1662	know how I speed.
1663	
1664	FORD	I am blest in your acquaintance. Do you know Ford,
1665	sir?
1666	
1667	FALSTAFF	Hang him, poor cuckoldly knave! I know him not:
1668	yet I wrong him to call him poor; they say the
1669	jealous wittolly knave hath masses of money; for the
1670	which his wife seems to me well-favored. I will
1671	use her as the key of the cuckoldly rogue's coffer;
1672	and there's my harvest-home.
1673	
1674	FORD	I would you knew Ford, sir, that you might avoid him
1675	if you saw him.
1676	
1677	FALSTAFF	Hang him, mechanical salt-butter rogue! I will
1678	stare him out of his wits; I will awe him with my
1679	cudgel: it shall hang like a meteor o'er the
1680	cuckold's horns. Master Brook, thou shalt know I
1681	will predominate over the peasant, and thou shalt
1682	lie with his wife. Come to me soon at night.
1683	Ford's a knave, and I will aggravate his style;
1684	thou, Master Brook, shalt know him for knave and
1685	cuckold. Come to me soon at night.
1686	
1687	[Exit]
1688	
1689	FORD	What a damned Epicurean rascal is this! My heart is
1690	ready to crack with impatience. Who says this is
1691	improvident jealousy? my wife hath sent to him; the
1692	hour is fixed; the match is made. Would any man
1693	have thought this? See the hell of having a false
1694	woman! My bed shall be abused, my coffers
1695	ransacked, my reputation gnawn at; and I shall not
1696	only receive this villanous wrong, but stand under
1697	the adoption of abominable terms, and by him that
1698	does me this wrong. Terms! names! Amaimon sounds
1699	well; Lucifer, well; Barbason, well; yet they are
1700	devils' additions, the names of fiends: but
1701	Cuckold! Wittol!--Cuckold! the devil himself hath
1702	not such a name. Page is an ass, a secure ass: he
1703	will trust his wife; he will not be jealous. I will
1704	rather trust a Fleming with my butter, Parson Hugh
1705	the Welshman with my cheese, an Irishman with my
1706	aqua-vitae bottle, or a thief to walk my ambling
1707	gelding, than my wife with herself; then she plots,
1708	then she ruminates, then she devises; and what they
1709	think in their hearts they may effect, they will
1710	break their hearts but they will effect. God be
1711	praised for my jealousy! Eleven o'clock the hour.
1712	I will prevent this, detect my wife, be revenged on
1713	Falstaff, and laugh at Page. I will about it;
1714	better three hours too soon than a minute too late.
1715	Fie, fie, fie! cuckold! cuckold! cuckold!

2047	thy hand, celestial; so. Boys of art, I have

2092	had you rather lead mine eyes, or eye your master's heels?
2093	
2094	ROBIN	I had rather, forsooth, go before you like a man
2095	than follow him like a dwarf.

2134	easy as a cannon will shoot point-blank twelve
2135	score. He pieces out his wife's inclination; he
2136	gives her folly motion and advantage: and now she's
2137	going to my wife, and Falstaff's boy with her. A
2138	man may hear this shower sing in the wind. And
2139	Falstaff's boy with her! Good plots, they are laid;
2140	and our revolted wives share damnation together.
2141	Well; I will take him, then torture my wife, pluck
2142	the borrowed veil of modesty from the so seeming
2143	Mistress Page, divulge Page himself for a secure and
2144	wilful Actaeon; and to these violent proceedings all
2145	my neighbours shall cry aim.
2146	
2147	[Clock heard]
2148	
2149	The clock gives me my cue, and my assurance bids me
2150	search: there I shall find Falstaff: I shall be
2151	rather praised for this than mocked; for it is as
2152	positive as the earth is firm that Falstaff is
2153	there: I will go.
2154	
2155	[Enter PAGE, SHALLOW, SLENDER, Host,
2156	SIR HUGH EVANS, DOCTOR CAIUS, and RUGBY]
2157	
2158	
2159	SHALLOW	|
2160	|
2161	PAGE	|  Well met, Master Ford.
2162	|
2163	&C	|
2164	
2165	
2166	FORD	Trust me, a good knot: I have good cheer at home;
2167	and I pray you all go with me.
2168	
2169	SHALLOW	I must excuse myself, Master Ford.
2170	
2171	SLENDER	And so must I, sir: we have appointed to dine with
2172	Mistress Anne, and I would not break with her for
2173	more money than I'll speak of.
2174	
2175	SHALLOW	We have lingered about a match between Anne Page and
2176	my cousin Slender, and this day we shall have our answer.
2177	
2178	SLENDER	I hope I have your good will, father Page.
2179	
2180	PAGE	You have, Master Slender; I stand wholly for you:
2181	but my wife, master doctor, is for you altogether.
2182	
2183	DOCTOR CAIUS	Ay, be-gar; and de maid is love-a me: my nursh-a
2184	Quickly tell me so mush.
2185	
2186	Host	What say you to young Master Fenton? he capers, he
2187	dances, he has eyes of youth, he writes verses, he
2188	speaks holiday, he smells April and May: he will
2189	carry't, he will carry't; 'tis in his buttons; he
2190	will carry't.
2191	
2192	PAGE	Not by my consent, I promise you. The gentleman is
2193	of no having: he kept company with the wild prince
2194	and Poins; he is of too high a region; he knows too
2195	much. No, he shall not knit a knot in his fortunes
2196	with the finger of my substance: if he take her,
2197	let him take her simply; the wealth I have waits on
2198	my consent, and my consent goes not that way.
2199	
2200	FORD	I beseech you heartily, some of you go home with me
2201	to dinner: besides your cheer, you shall have
2202	sport; I will show you a monster. Master doctor,
2203	you shall go; so shall you, Master Page; and you, Sir Hugh.
2204	
2205	SHALLOW	Well, fare you well: we shall have the freer wooing
2206	at Master Page's.
2207	
2208	[Exeunt SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
2209	
2210	DOCTOR CAIUS	Go home, John Rugby; I come anon.
2211	
2212	[Exit RUGBY]
2213	
2214	Host	Farewell, my hearts: I will to my honest knight
2215	Falstaff, and drink canary with him.
2216	
2217	[Exit]
2218	
2219	FORD	[Aside]  I think I shall drink in pipe wine first
2220	with him; I'll make him dance. Will you go, gentles?
2221	
2222	All	Have with you to see this monster.
2223	
2224	[Exeunt]

2229	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
2230	
2231	
2232	ACT III
2233	
2234	
2235	
2236	SCENE III	A room in FORD'S house.
2237	
2238	
2239	[Enter MISTRESS FORD and MISTRESS PAGE]
2240	
2241	MISTRESS FORD	What, John! What, Robert!
2242	
2243	MISTRESS PAGE	Quickly, quickly! is the buck-basket--
2244	
2245	MISTRESS FORD	I warrant. What, Robin, I say!
2246	
2247	[Enter Servants with a basket]
2248	
2249	MISTRESS PAGE	Come, come, come.
2250	
2251	MISTRESS FORD	Here, set it down.
2252	
2253	MISTRESS PAGE	Give your men the charge; we must be brief.
2254	
2255	MISTRESS FORD	Marry, as I told you before, John and Robert, be
2256	ready here hard by in the brew-house: and when I
2257	suddenly call you, come forth, and without any pause
2258	or staggering take this basket on your shoulders:
2259	that done, trudge with it in all haste, and carry
2260	it among the whitsters in Datchet-mead, and there
2261	empty it in the muddy ditch close by the Thames side.
2262	
2263	MISTRESS PAGE	You will do it?
2264	
2265	MISTRESS FORD	I ha' told them over and over; they lack no
2266	direction. Be gone, and come when you are called.
2267	
2268	[Exeunt Servants]
2269	
2270	MISTRESS PAGE	Here comes little Robin.
2271	
2272	[Enter ROBIN]
2273	
2274	MISTRESS FORD	How now, my eyas-musket! what news with you?
2275	
2276	ROBIN	My master, Sir John, is come in at your back-door,
2277	Mistress Ford, and requests your company.
2278	
2279	MISTRESS PAGE	You little Jack-a-Lent, have you been true to us?
2280	
2281	ROBIN	Ay, I'll be sworn. My master knows not of your
2282	being here and hath threatened to put me into
2283	everlasting liberty if I tell you of it; for he
2284	swears he'll turn me away.
2285	
2286	MISTRESS PAGE	Thou'rt a good boy: this secrecy of thine shall be
2287	a tailor to thee and shall make thee a new doublet
2288	and hose. I'll go hide me.
2289	
2290	MISTRESS FORD	Do so. Go tell thy master I am alone.
2291	
2292	[Exit ROBIN]
2293	
2294	Mistress Page, remember you your cue.
2295	
2296	MISTRESS PAGE	I warrant thee; if I do not act it, hiss me.
2297	
2298	[Exit]
2299	
2300	MISTRESS FORD	Go to, then: we'll use this unwholesome humidity,
2301	this gross watery pumpion; we'll teach him to know
2302	turtles from jays.
2303	
2304	[Enter FALSTAFF]
2305	
2306	FALSTAFF	Have I caught thee, my heavenly jewel? Why, now let
2307	me die, for I have lived long enough: this is the
2308	period of my ambition: O this blessed hour!
2309	
2310	MISTRESS FORD	O sweet Sir John!
2311	
2312	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, I cannot cog, I cannot prate,
2313	Mistress Ford. Now shall I sin in my wish: I would
2314	thy husband were dead: I'll speak it before the
2315	best lord; I would make thee my lady.
2316	
2317	MISTRESS FORD	I your lady, Sir John! alas, I should be a pitiful lady!
2318	
2319	FALSTAFF	Let the court of France show me such another. I see
2320	how thine eye would emulate the diamond: thou hast
2321	the right arched beauty of the brow that becomes the
2322	ship-tire, the tire-valiant, or any tire of
2323	Venetian admittance.
2324	
2325	MISTRESS FORD	A plain kerchief, Sir John: my brows become nothing
2326	else; nor that well neither.
2327	
2328	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou art a traitor to say so: thou
2329	wouldst make an absolute courtier; and the firm
2330	fixture of thy foot would give an excellent motion
2331	to thy gait in a semi-circled farthingale. I see
2332	what thou wert, if Fortune thy foe were not, Nature
2333	thy friend. Come, thou canst not hide it.
2334	
2335	MISTRESS FORD	Believe me, there is no such thing in me.
2336	
2337	FALSTAFF	What made me love thee? let that persuade thee
2338	there's something extraordinary in thee. Come, I
2339	cannot cog and say thou art this and that, like a
2340	many of these lisping hawthorn-buds, that come like
2341	women in men's apparel, and smell like Bucklersbury
2342	in simple time; I cannot: but I love thee; none
2343	but thee; and thou deservest it.
2344	
2345	MISTRESS FORD	Do not betray me, sir. I fear you love Mistress Page.
2346	
2347	FALSTAFF	Thou mightst as well say I love to walk by the
2348	Counter-gate, which is as hateful to me as the reek
2349	of a lime-kiln.
2350	
2351	MISTRESS FORD	Well, heaven knows how I love you; and you shall one
2352	day find it.
2353	
2354	FALSTAFF	Keep in that mind; I'll deserve it.
2355	
2356	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, I must tell you, so you do; or else I could not
2357	be in that mind.
2358	
2359	ROBIN	[Within]  Mistress Ford, Mistress Ford! here's
2360	Mistress Page at the door, sweating and blowing and
2361	looking wildly, and would needs speak with you presently.
2362	
2363	FALSTAFF	She shall not see me: I will ensconce me behind the arras.
2364	
2365	MISTRESS FORD	Pray you, do so: she's a very tattling woman.
2366	
2367	[FALSTAFF hides himself]
2368	
2369	[Re-enter MISTRESS PAGE and ROBIN]
2370	
2371	What's the matter? how now!
2372	
2373	MISTRESS PAGE	O Mistress Ford, what have you done? You're shamed,
2374	you're overthrown, you're undone for ever!
2375	
2376	MISTRESS FORD	What's the matter, good Mistress Page?
2377	
2378	MISTRESS PAGE	O well-a-day, Mistress Ford! having an honest man
2379	to your husband, to give him such cause of suspicion!
2380	
2381	MISTRESS FORD	What cause of suspicion?
2382	
2383	MISTRESS PAGE	What cause of suspicion! Out pon you! how am I
2384	mistook in you!
2385	
2386	MISTRESS FORD	Why, alas, what's the matter?
2387	
2388	MISTRESS PAGE	Your husband's coming hither, woman, with all the
2389	officers in Windsor, to search for a gentleman that
2390	he says is here now in the house by your consent, to
2391	take an ill advantage of his assence: you are undone.
2392	
2393	MISTRESS FORD	'Tis not so, I hope.
2394	
2395	MISTRESS PAGE	Pray heaven it be not so, that you have such a man
2396	here! but 'tis most certain your husband's coming,
2397	with half Windsor at his heels, to search for such a
2398	one. I come before to tell you. If you know
2399	yourself clear, why, I am glad of it; but if you
2400	have a friend here convey, convey him out. Be not
2401	amazed; call all your senses to you; defend your
2402	reputation, or bid farewell to your good life for ever.
2403	
2404	MISTRESS FORD	What shall I do? There is a gentleman my dear
2405	friend; and I fear not mine own shame so much as his
2406	peril: I had rather than a thousand pound he were
2407	out of the house.
2408	
2409	MISTRESS PAGE	For shame! never stand 'you had rather' and 'you
2410	had rather:' your husband's here at hand, bethink
2411	you of some conveyance: in the house you cannot
2412	hide him. O, how have you deceived me! Look, here
2413	is a basket: if he be of any reasonable stature, he
2414	may creep in here; and throw foul linen upon him, as
2415	if it were going to bucking: or--it is whiting-time
2416	--send him by your two men to Datchet-mead.
2417	
2418	MISTRESS FORD	He's too big to go in there. What shall I do?
2419	
2420	FALSTAFF	[Coming forward]  Let me see't, let me see't, O, let
2421	me see't! I'll in, I'll in. Follow your friend's
2422	counsel. I'll in.
2423	
2424	MISTRESS PAGE	What, Sir John Falstaff! Are these your letters, knight?
2425	
2426	FALSTAFF	I love thee. Help me away. Let me creep in here.
2427	I'll never--
2428	
2429	[Gets into the basket; they cover him with foul linen]
2430	
2431	MISTRESS PAGE	Help to cover your master, boy. Call your men,
2432	Mistress Ford. You dissembling knight!
2433	
2434	MISTRESS FORD	What, John! Robert! John!
2435	
2436	[Exit ROBIN]
2437	
2438	[Re-enter Servants]
2439	
2440	Go take up these clothes here quickly. Where's the
2441	cowl-staff? look, how you drumble! Carry them to
2442	the laundress in Datchet-meat; quickly, come.
2443	
2444	[Enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
2445	
2446	FORD	Pray you, come near: if I suspect without cause,
2447	why then make sport at me; then let me be your jest;
2448	I deserve it. How now! whither bear you this?
2449	
2450	Servant	To the laundress, forsooth.
2451	
2452	MISTRESS FORD	Why, what have you to do whither they bear it? You
2453	were best meddle with buck-washing.
2454	
2455	FORD	Buck! I would I could wash myself of the buck!
2456	Buck, buck, buck! Ay, buck; I warrant you, buck;
2457	and of the season too, it shall appear.
2458	
2459	[Exeunt Servants with the basket]
2460	
2461	Gentlemen, I have dreamed to-night; I'll tell you my
2462	dream. Here, here, here be my keys: ascend my
2463	chambers; search, seek, find out: I'll warrant
2464	we'll unkennel the fox. Let me stop this way first.
2465	
2466	[Locking the door]
2467	
2468	So, now uncape.
2469	
2470	PAGE	Good Master Ford, be contented: you wrong yourself too much.
2471	
2472	FORD	True, Master Page. Up, gentlemen: you shall see
2473	sport anon: follow me, gentlemen.
2474	
2475	[Exit]
2476	
2477	SIR HUGH EVANS	This is fery fantastical humours and jealousies.
2478	
2479	DOCTOR CAIUS	By gar, 'tis no the fashion of France; it is not
2480	jealous in France.
2481	
2482	PAGE	Nay, follow him, gentlemen; see the issue of his search.
2483	
2484	[Exeunt PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
2485	
2486	MISTRESS PAGE	Is there not a double excellency in this?
2487	
2488	MISTRESS FORD	I know not which pleases me better, that my husband
2489	is deceived, or Sir John.
2490	
2491	MISTRESS PAGE	What a taking was he in when your husband asked who
2492	was in the basket!
2493	
2494	MISTRESS FORD	I am half afraid he will have need of washing; so
2495	throwing him into the water will do him a benefit.
2496	
2497	MISTRESS PAGE	Hang him, dishonest rascal! I would all of the same
2498	strain were in the same distress.
2499	
2500	MISTRESS FORD	I think my husband hath some special suspicion of
2501	Falstaff's being here; for I never saw him so gross
2502	in his jealousy till now.
2503	
2504	MISTRESS PAGE	I will lay a plot to try that; and we will yet have
2505	more tricks with Falstaff: his dissolute disease will
2506	scarce obey this medicine.
2507	
2508	MISTRESS FORD	Shall we send that foolish carrion, Mistress
2509	Quickly, to him, and excuse his throwing into the
2510	water; and give him another hope, to betray him to
2511	another punishment?
2512	
2513	MISTRESS PAGE	We will do it: let him be sent for to-morrow,
2514	eight o'clock, to have amends.
2515	
2516	[Re-enter FORD, PAGE, DOCTOR CAIUS, and
2517	SIR HUGH EVANS]
2518	
2519	FORD	I cannot find him: may be the knave bragged of that
2520	he could not compass.
2521	
2522	MISTRESS PAGE	[Aside to MISTRESS FORD]  Heard you that?
2523	
2524	MISTRESS FORD	You use me well, Master Ford, do you?
2525	
2526	FORD	Ay, I do so.
2527	
2528	MISTRESS FORD	Heaven make you better than your thoughts!
2529	
2530	FORD	Amen!
2531	
2532	MISTRESS PAGE	You do yourself mighty wrong, Master Ford.
2533	
2534	FORD	Ay, ay; I must bear it.
2535	
2536	SIR HUGH EVANS	If there be any pody in the house, and in the
2537	chambers, and in the coffers, and in the presses,
2538	heaven forgive my sins at the day of judgment!
2539	
2540	DOCTOR CAIUS	By gar, nor I too: there is no bodies.
2541	
2542	PAGE	Fie, fie, Master Ford! are you not ashamed? What
2543	spirit, what devil suggests this imagination? I
2544	would not ha' your distemper in this kind for the
2545	wealth of Windsor Castle.
2546	
2547	FORD	'Tis my fault, Master Page: I suffer for it.
2548	
2549	SIR HUGH EVANS	You suffer for a pad conscience: your wife is as
2550	honest a 'omans as I will desires among five
2551	thousand, and five hundred too.
2552	
2553	DOCTOR CAIUS	By gar, I see 'tis an honest woman.
2554	
2555	FORD	Well, I promised you a dinner. Come, come, walk in
2556	the Park: I pray you, pardon me; I will hereafter
2557	make known to you why I have done this. Come,
2558	wife; come, Mistress Page. I pray you, pardon me;
2559	pray heartily, pardon me.
2560	
2561	PAGE	Let's go in, gentlemen; but, trust me, we'll mock
2562	him. I do invite you to-morrow morning to my house
2563	to breakfast: after, we'll a-birding together; I
2564	have a fine hawk for the bush. Shall it be so?
2565	
2566	FORD	Any thing.
2567	
2568	SIR HUGH EVANS	If there is one, I shall make two in the company.
2569	
2570	DOCTOR CAIUS	If dere be one or two, I shall make-a the turd.
2571	
2572	FORD	Pray you, go, Master Page.
2573	
2574	SIR HUGH EVANS	I pray you now, remembrance tomorrow on the lousy
2575	knave, mine host.
2576	
2577	DOCTOR CAIUS	Dat is good; by gar, with all my heart!
2578	
2579	SIR HUGH EVANS	A lousy knave, to have his gibes and his mockeries!

2586	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
2587	
2588	
2589	ACT III
2590	
2591	
2592	
2593	SCENE IV	A room in PAGE'S house.
2594	
2595	
2596	[Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]
2597	
2598	FENTON	I see I cannot get thy father's love;
2599	Therefore no more turn me to him, sweet Nan.
2600	
2601	ANNE PAGE	Alas, how then?
2602	
2603	FENTON	                  Why, thou must be thyself.
2604	He doth object I am too great of birth--,
2605	And that, my state being gall'd with my expense,
2606	I seek to heal it only by his wealth:
2607	Besides these, other bars he lays before me,
2608	My riots past, my wild societies;
2609	And tells me 'tis a thing impossible
2610	I should love thee but as a property.
2611	
2612	ANNE PAGE	May be he tells you true.
2613	
2614	FENTON	No, heaven so speed me in my time to come!
2615	Albeit I will confess thy father's wealth
2616	Was the first motive that I woo'd thee, Anne:
2617	Yet, wooing thee, I found thee of more value
2618	Than stamps in gold or sums in sealed bags;
2619	And 'tis the very riches of thyself
2620	That now I aim at.
2621	
2622	ANNE PAGE	                  Gentle Master Fenton,
2623	Yet seek my father's love; still seek it, sir:
2624	If opportunity and humblest suit
2625	Cannot attain it, why, then,--hark you hither!
2626	
2627	[They converse apart]
2628	
2629	[Enter SHALLOW, SLENDER, and MISTRESS QUICKLY]
2630	
2631	SHALLOW	Break their talk, Mistress Quickly: my kinsman shall
2632	speak for himself.
2633	
2634	SLENDER	I'll make a shaft or a bolt on't: 'slid, 'tis but
2635	venturing.
2636	
2637	SHALLOW	Be not dismayed.
2638	
2639	SLENDER	No, she shall not dismay me: I care not for that,
2640	but that I am afeard.
2641	
2642	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Hark ye; Master Slender would speak a word with you.
2643	
2644	ANNE PAGE	I come to him.
2645	
2646	[Aside]
2647	
2648	This is my father's choice.
2649	O, what a world of vile ill-favor'd faults
2650	Looks handsome in three hundred pounds a-year!
2651	
2652	MISTRESS QUICKLY	And how does good Master Fenton? Pray you, a word with you.
2653	
2654	SHALLOW	She's coming; to her, coz. O boy, thou hadst a father!
2655	
2656	SLENDER	I had a father, Mistress Anne; my uncle can tell you
2657	good jests of him. Pray you, uncle, tell Mistress
2658	Anne the jest, how my father stole two geese out of
2659	a pen, good uncle.
2660	
2661	SHALLOW	Mistress Anne, my cousin loves you.
2662	
2663	SLENDER	Ay, that I do; as well as I love any woman in
2664	Gloucestershire.
2665	
2666	SHALLOW	He will maintain you like a gentlewoman.
2667	
2668	SLENDER	Ay, that I will, come cut and long-tail, under the
2669	degree of a squire.
2670	
2671	SHALLOW	He will make you a hundred and fifty pounds jointure.
2672	
2673	ANNE PAGE	Good Master Shallow, let him woo for himself.
2674	
2675	SHALLOW	Marry, I thank you for it; I thank you for that good
2676	comfort. She calls you, coz: I'll leave you.
2677	
2678	ANNE PAGE	Now, Master Slender,--
2679	
2680	SLENDER	Now, good Mistress Anne,--
2681	
2682	ANNE PAGE	What is your will?
2683	
2684	SLENDER	My will! 'od's heartlings, that's a pretty jest
2685	indeed! I ne'er made my will yet, I thank heaven; I
2686	am not such a sickly creature, I give heaven praise.
2687	
2688	ANNE PAGE	I mean, Master Slender, what would you with me?
2689	
2690	SLENDER	Truly, for mine own part, I would little or nothing
2691	with you. Your father and my uncle hath made
2692	motions: if it be my luck, so; if not, happy man be
2693	his dole! They can tell you how things go better
2694	than I can: you may ask your father; here he comes.
2695	
2696	[Enter PAGE and MISTRESS PAGE]
2697	
2698	PAGE	Now, Master Slender: love him, daughter Anne.
2699	Why, how now! what does Master Fenton here?
2700	You wrong me, sir, thus still to haunt my house:
2701	I told you, sir, my daughter is disposed of.
2702	
2703	FENTON	Nay, Master Page, be not impatient.
2704	
2705	MISTRESS PAGE	Good Master Fenton, come not to my child.
2706	
2707	PAGE	She is no match for you.
2708	
2709	FENTON	Sir, will you hear me?
2710	
2711	PAGE	No, good Master Fenton.
2712	Come, Master Shallow; come, son Slender, in.
2713	Knowing my mind, you wrong me, Master Fenton.
2714	
2715	[Exeunt PAGE, SHALLOW, and SLENDER]
2716	
2717	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Speak to Mistress Page.
2718	
2719	FENTON	Good Mistress Page, for that I love your daughter
2720	In such a righteous fashion as I do,
2721	Perforce, against all cheques, rebukes and manners,
2722	I must advance the colours of my love
2723	And not retire: let me have your good will.
2724	
2725	ANNE PAGE	Good mother, do not marry me to yond fool.
2726	
2727	MISTRESS PAGE	I mean it not; I seek you a better husband.
2728	
2729	MISTRESS QUICKLY	That's my master, master doctor.
2730	
2731	ANNE PAGE	Alas, I had rather be set quick i' the earth
2732	And bowl'd to death with turnips!
2733	
2734	MISTRESS PAGE	Come, trouble not yourself. Good Master Fenton,
2735	I will not be your friend nor enemy:
2736	My daughter will I question how she loves you,
2737	And as I find her, so am I affected.
2738	Till then farewell, sir: she must needs go in;
2739	Her father will be angry.
2740	
2741	FENTON	Farewell, gentle mistress: farewell, Nan.
2742	
2743	[Exeunt MISTRESS PAGE and ANNE PAGE]
2744	
2745	MISTRESS QUICKLY	This is my doing, now: 'Nay,' said I, 'will you cast
2746	away your child on a fool, and a physician? Look on
2747	Master Fenton:' this is my doing.
2748	
2749	FENTON	I thank thee; and I pray thee, once to-night
2750	Give my sweet Nan this ring: there's for thy pains.
2751	
2752	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Now heaven send thee good fortune!
2753	
2754	[Exit FENTON]
2755	
2756	A kind heart he hath: a woman would run through
2757	fire and water for such a kind heart. But yet I
2758	would my master had Mistress Anne; or I would
2759	Master Slender had her; or, in sooth, I would Master
2760	Fenton had her; I will do what I can for them all
2761	three; for so I have promised, and I'll be as good
2762	as my word; but speciously for Master Fenton. Well,
2763	I must of another errand to Sir John Falstaff from
2764	my two mistresses: what a beast am I to slack it!

2771	THE MERRY WIVES OF WINDSOR
2772	
2773	
2774	ACT III
2775	
2776	
2777	
2778	SCENE V	A room in the Garter Inn.
2779	
2780	
2781	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
2782	
2783	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, I say,--
2784	
2785	BARDOLPH	Here, sir.
2786	
2787	FALSTAFF	Go fetch me a quart of sack; put a toast in't.
2788	
2789	[Exit BARDOLPH]
2790	
2791	Have I lived to be carried in a basket, like a
2792	barrow of butcher's offal, and to be thrown in the
2793	Thames? Well, if I be served such another trick,
2794	I'll have my brains ta'en out and buttered, and give
2795	them to a dog for a new-year's gift. The rogues
2796	slighted me into the river with as little remorse as
2797	they would have drowned a blind bitch's puppies,
2798	fifteen i' the litter: and you may know by my size
2799	that I have a kind of alacrity in sinking; if the
2800	bottom were as deep as hell, I should down. I had
2801	been drowned, but that the shore was shelvy and
2802	shallow,--a death that I abhor; for the water swells
2803	a man; and what a thing should I have been when I
2804	had been swelled! I should have been a mountain of mummy.
2805	
2806	[Re-enter BARDOLPH with sack]
2807	
2808	BARDOLPH	Here's Mistress Quickly, sir, to speak with you.
2809	
2810	FALSTAFF	Let me pour in some sack to the Thames water; for my
2811	belly's as cold as if I had swallowed snowballs for
2812	pills to cool the reins. Call her in.
2813	
2814	BARDOLPH	Come in, woman!
2815	
2816	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
2817	
2818	MISTRESS QUICKLY	By your leave; I cry you mercy: give your worship
2819	good morrow.
2820	
2821	FALSTAFF	Take away these chalices. Go brew me a pottle of
2822	sack finely.
2823	
2824	BARDOLPH	With eggs, sir?
2825	
2826	FALSTAFF	Simple of itself; I'll no pullet-sperm in my brewage.
2827	
2828	[Exit BARDOLPH]
2829	How now!
2830	
2831	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, sir, I come to your worship from Mistress Ford.
2832	
2833	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford! I have had ford enough; I was thrown
2834	into the ford; I have my belly full of ford.
2835	
2836	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Alas the day! good heart, that was not her fault:
2837	she does so take on with her men; they mistook their erection.
2838	
2839	FALSTAFF	So did I mine, to build upon a foolish woman's promise.
2840	
2841	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, she laments, sir, for it, that it would yearn
2842	your heart to see it. Her husband goes this morning
2843	a-birding; she desires you once more to come to her
2844	between eight and nine: I must carry her word
2845	quickly: she'll make you amends, I warrant you.
2846	
2847	FALSTAFF	Well, I will visit her: tell her so; and bid her
2848	think what a man is: let her consider his frailty,
2849	and then judge of my merit.
2850	
2851	MISTRESS QUICKLY	I will tell her.
2852	
2853	FALSTAFF	Do so. Between nine and ten, sayest thou?
2854	
2855	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Eight and nine, sir.
2856	
2857	FALSTAFF	Well, be gone: I will not miss her.
2858	
2859	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Peace be with you, sir.
2860	
2861	[Exit]
2862	
2863	FALSTAFF	I marvel I hear not of Master Brook; he sent me word
2864	to stay within: I like his money well. O, here he comes.
2865	
2866	[Enter FORD]
2867	
2868	FORD	Bless you, sir!
2869	
2870	FALSTAFF	Now, master Brook, you come to know what hath passed
2871	between me and Ford's wife?
2872	
2873	FORD	That, indeed, Sir John, is my business.
2874	
2875	FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will not lie to you: I was at her
2876	house the hour she appointed me.
2877	
2878	FORD	And sped you, sir?
2879	
2880	FALSTAFF	Very ill-favoredly, Master Brook.
2881	
2882	FORD	How so, sir? Did she change her determination?
2883	
2884	FALSTAFF	No, Master Brook; but the peaking Cornuto her
2885	husband, Master Brook, dwelling in a continual
2886	'larum of jealousy, comes me in the instant of our
2887	encounter, after we had embraced, kissed, protested,
2888	and, as it were, spoke the prologue of our comedy;
2889	and at his heels a rabble of his companions, thither
2890	provoked and instigated by his distemper, and,
2891	forsooth, to search his house for his wife's love.
2892	
2893	FORD	What, while you were there?
2894	
2895	FALSTAFF	While I was there.
2896	
2897	FORD	And did he search for you, and could not find you?
2898	
2899	FALSTAFF	You shall hear. As good luck would have it, comes
2900	in one Mistress Page; gives intelligence of Ford's
2901	approach; and, in her invention and Ford's wife's
2902	distraction, they conveyed me into a buck-basket.
2903	
2904	FORD	A buck-basket!
2905	
2906	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, a buck-basket! rammed me in with foul
2907	shirts and smocks, socks, foul stockings, greasy
2908	napkins; that, Master Brook, there was the rankest
2909	compound of villanous smell that ever offended nostril.
2910	
2911	FORD	And how long lay you there?
2912	
2913	FALSTAFF	Nay, you shall hear, Master Brook, what I have
2914	suffered to bring this woman to evil for your good.
2915	Being thus crammed in the basket, a couple of Ford's
2916	knaves, his hinds, were called forth by their
2917	mistress to carry me in the name of foul clothes to
2918	Datchet-lane: they took me on their shoulders; met
2919	the jealous knave their master in the door, who
2920	asked them once or twice what they had in their
2921	basket: I quaked for fear, lest the lunatic knave
2922	would have searched it; but fate, ordaining he
2923	should be a cuckold, held his hand. Well: on went he
2924	for a search, and away went I for foul clothes. But
2925	mark the sequel, Master Brook: I suffered the pangs
2926	of three several deaths; first, an intolerable
2927	fright, to be detected with a jealous rotten
2928	bell-wether; next, to be compassed, like a good
2929	bilbo, in the circumference of a peck, hilt to
2930	point, heel to head; and then, to be stopped in,
2931	like a strong distillation, with stinking clothes
2932	that fretted in their own grease: think of that,--a
2933	man of my kidney,--think of that,--that am as subject
2934	to heat as butter; a man of continual dissolution
2935	and thaw: it was a miracle to scape suffocation.
2936	And in the height of this bath, when I was more than
2937	half stewed in grease, like a Dutch dish, to be
2938	thrown into the Thames, and cooled, glowing hot,
2939	in that surge, like a horse-shoe; think of
2940	that,--hissing hot,--think of that, Master Brook.
2941	
2942	FORD	In good sadness, I am sorry that for my sake you
2943	have sufferd all this. My suit then is desperate;
2944	you'll undertake her no more?
2945	
2946	FALSTAFF	Master Brook, I will be thrown into Etna, as I have
2947	been into Thames, ere I will leave her thus. Her
2948	husband is this morning gone a-birding: I have
2949	received from her another embassy of meeting; 'twixt
2950	eight and nine is the hour, Master Brook.
2951	
2952	FORD	'Tis past eight already, sir.
2953	
2954	FALSTAFF	Is it? I will then address me to my appointment.
2955	Come to me at your convenient leisure, and you shall
2956	know how I speed; and the conclusion shall be
2957	crowned with your enjoying her. Adieu. You shall
2958	have her, Master Brook; Master Brook, you shall
2959	cuckold Ford.
2960	
2961	[Exit]
2962	
2963	FORD	Hum! ha! is this a vision? is this a dream? do I
2964	sleep? Master Ford awake! awake, Master Ford!
2965	there's a hole made in your best coat, Master Ford.
2966	This 'tis to be married! this 'tis to have linen
2967	and buck-baskets! Well, I will proclaim myself
2968	what I am: I will now take the lecher; he is at my
2969	house; he cannot 'scape me; 'tis impossible he
2970	should; he cannot creep into a halfpenny purse,
2971	nor into a pepper-box: but, lest the devil that
2972	guides him should aid him, I will search
2973	impossible places. Though what I am I cannot avoid,
2974	yet to be what I would not shall not make me tame:
2975	if I have horns to make one mad, let the proverb go
2976	with me: I'll be horn-mad.

2995	
2996	MISTRESS PAGE	Is he at Master Ford's already, think'st thou?
2997	
2998	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sure he is by this, or will be presently: but,
2999	truly, he is very courageous mad about his throwing
3000	into the water. Mistress Ford desires you to come suddenly.
3001	
3002	MISTRESS PAGE	I'll be with her by and by; I'll but bring my young
3003	man here to school. Look, where his master comes;
3004	'tis a playing-day, I see.
3005	
3006	[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]
3007	
3008	How now, Sir Hugh! no school to-day?
3009	
3010	SIR HUGH EVANS	No; Master Slender is let the boys leave to play.
3011	
3012	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Blessing of his heart!
3013	
3014	MISTRESS PAGE	Sir Hugh, my husband says my son profits nothing in
3015	the world at his book. I pray you, ask him some
3016	questions in his accidence.
3017	
3018	SIR HUGH EVANS	Come hither, William; hold up your head; come.
3019	
3020	MISTRESS PAGE	Come on, sirrah; hold up your head; answer your
3021	master, be not afraid.
3022	
3023	SIR HUGH EVANS	William, how many numbers is in nouns?
3024	
3025	WILLIAM PAGE	Two.
3026	
3027	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Truly, I thought there had been one number more,
3028	because they say, ''Od's nouns.'
3029	
3030	SIR HUGH EVANS	Peace your tattlings! What is 'fair,' William?
3031	
3032	WILLIAM PAGE	Pulcher.
3033	
3034	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Polecats! there are fairer things than polecats, sure.
3035	
3036	SIR HUGH EVANS	You are a very simplicity 'oman: I pray you peace.
3037	What is 'lapis,' William?
3038	
3039	WILLIAM PAGE	A stone.
3040	
3041	SIR HUGH EVANS	And what is 'a stone,' William?
3042	
3043	WILLIAM PAGE	A pebble.
3044	
3045	SIR HUGH EVANS	No, it is 'lapis:' I pray you, remember in your prain.
3046	
3047	WILLIAM PAGE	Lapis.
3048	
3049	SIR HUGH EVANS	That is a good William. What is he, William, that
3050	does lend articles?
3051	
3052	WILLIAM PAGE	Articles are borrowed of the pronoun, and be thus
3053	declined, Singulariter, nominativo, hic, haec, hoc.
3054	
3055	SIR HUGH EVANS	Nominativo, hig, hag, hog; pray you, mark:
3056	genitivo, hujus. Well, what is your accusative case?
3057	
3058	WILLIAM PAGE	Accusativo, hinc.
3059	
3060	SIR HUGH EVANS	I pray you, have your remembrance, child,
3061	accusative, hung, hang, hog.
3062	
3063	MISTRESS QUICKLY	'Hang-hog' is Latin for bacon, I warrant you.
3064	
3065	SIR HUGH EVANS	Leave your prabbles, 'oman. What is the focative
3066	case, William?
3067	
3068	WILLIAM PAGE	O,--vocativo, O.
3069	
3070	SIR HUGH EVANS	Remember, William; focative is caret.
3071	
3072	MISTRESS QUICKLY	And that's a good root.
3073	
3074	SIR HUGH EVANS	'Oman, forbear.
3075	
3076	MISTRESS PAGE	Peace!
3077	
3078	SIR HUGH EVANS	What is your genitive case plural, William?
3079	
3080	WILLIAM PAGE	Genitive case!
3081	
3082	SIR HUGH EVANS	Ay.
3083	
3084	WILLIAM PAGE	Genitive,--horum, harum, horum.
3085	
3086	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Vengeance of Jenny's case! fie on her! never name
3087	her, child, if she be a whore.
3088	
3089	SIR HUGH EVANS	For shame, 'oman.
3090	
3091	MISTRESS QUICKLY	You do ill to teach the child such words: he
3092	teaches him to hick and to hack, which they'll do
3093	fast enough of themselves, and to call 'horum:' fie upon you!
3094	
3095	SIR HUGH EVANS	'Oman, art thou lunatics? hast thou no
3096	understandings for thy cases and the numbers of the
3097	genders? Thou art as foolish Christian creatures as
3098	I would desires.
3099	
3100	MISTRESS PAGE	Prithee, hold thy peace.
3101	
3102	SIR HUGH EVANS	Show me now, William, some declensions of your pronouns.
3103	
3104	WILLIAM PAGE	Forsooth, I have forgot.
3105	
3106	SIR HUGH EVANS	It is qui, quae, quod: if you forget your 'quies,'
3107	your 'quaes,' and your 'quods,' you must be
3108	preeches. Go your ways, and play; go.
3109	
3110	MISTRESS PAGE	He is a better scholar than I thought he was.
3111	
3112	SIR HUGH EVANS	He is a good sprag memory. Farewell, Mistress Page.

3114	MISTRESS PAGE	Adieu, good Sir Hugh.

3136	
3137	FALSTAFF	Mistress Ford, your sorrow hath eaten up my
3138	sufferance. I see you are obsequious in your love,
3139	and I profess requital to a hair's breadth; not
3140	only, Mistress Ford, in the simple
3141	office of love, but in all the accoutrement,
3142	complement and ceremony of it. But are you
3143	sure of your husband now?
3144	
3145	MISTRESS FORD	He's a-birding, sweet Sir John.
3146	
3147	MISTRESS PAGE	[Within]  What, ho, gossip Ford! what, ho!
3148	
3149	MISTRESS FORD	Step into the chamber, Sir John.

3158	
3159	MISTRESS PAGE	Indeed!
3160	
3161	MISTRESS FORD	No, certainly.
3162	
3163	[Aside to her]
3164	
3165	Speak louder.
3166	
3167	MISTRESS PAGE	Truly, I am so glad you have nobody here.
3168	
3169	MISTRESS FORD	Why?
3170	
3171	MISTRESS PAGE	Why, woman, your husband is in his old lunes again:
3172	he so takes on yonder with my husband; so rails
3173	against all married mankind; so curses all Eve's
3174	daughters, of what complexion soever; and so buffets
3175	himself on the forehead, crying, 'Peer out, peer
3176	out!' that any madness I ever yet beheld seemed but
3177	tameness, civility and patience, to this his
3178	distemper he is in now: I am glad the fat knight is not here.
3179	
3180	MISTRESS FORD	Why, does he talk of him?
3181	
3182	MISTRESS PAGE	Of none but him; and swears he was carried out, the
3183	last time he searched for him, in a basket; protests
3184	to my husband he is now here, and hath drawn him and
3185	the rest of their company from their sport, to make
3186	another experiment of his suspicion: but I am glad
3187	the knight is not here; now he shall see his own foolery.
3188	
3189	MISTRESS FORD	How near is he, Mistress Page?
3190	
3191	MISTRESS PAGE	Hard by; at street end; he will be here anon.
3192	
3193	MISTRESS FORD	I am undone! The knight is here.
3194	
3195	MISTRESS PAGE	Why then you are utterly shamed, and he's but a dead
3196	man. What a woman are you!--Away with him, away
3197	with him! better shame than murder.
3198	
3199	FORD	Which way should be go? how should I bestow him?
3200	Shall I put him into the basket again?
3201	
3202	[Re-enter FALSTAFF]
3203	
3204	FALSTAFF	No, I'll come no more i' the basket. May I not go
3205	out ere he come?
3206	
3207	MISTRESS PAGE	Alas, three of Master Ford's brothers watch the door
3208	with pistols, that none shall issue out; otherwise
3209	you might slip away ere he came. But what make you here?
3210	
3211	FALSTAFF	What shall I do? I'll creep up into the chimney.
3212	
3213	MISTRESS FORD	There they always use to discharge their
3214	birding-pieces. Creep into the kiln-hole.
3215	
3216	FALSTAFF	Where is it?
3217	
3218	MISTRESS FORD	He will seek there, on my word. Neither press,
3219	coffer, chest, trunk, well, vault, but he hath an
3220	abstract for the remembrance of such places, and
3221	goes to them by his note: there is no hiding you in the house.
3222	
3223	FALSTAFF	I'll go out then.
3224	
3225	MISTRESS PAGE	If you go out in your own semblance, you die, Sir
3226	John. Unless you go out disguised--
3227	
3228	MISTRESS FORD	How might we disguise him?
3229	
3230	MISTRESS PAGE	Alas the day, I know not! There is no woman's gown
3231	big enough for him otherwise he might put on a hat,
3232	a muffler and a kerchief, and so escape.
3233	
3234	FALSTAFF	Good hearts, devise something: any extremity rather
3235	than a mischief.
3236	
3237	MISTRESS FORD	My maid's aunt, the fat woman of Brentford, has a
3238	gown above.
3239	
3240	MISTRESS PAGE	On my word, it will serve him; she's as big as he
3241	is: and there's her thrummed hat and her muffler
3242	too. Run up, Sir John.
3243	
3244	MISTRESS FORD	Go, go, sweet Sir John: Mistress Page and I will
3245	look some linen for your head.
3246	
3247	MISTRESS PAGE	Quick, quick! we'll come dress you straight: put
3248	on the gown the while.
3249	
3250	[Exit FALSTAFF]
3251	
3252	MISTRESS FORD	I would my husband would meet him in this shape: he
3253	cannot abide the old woman of Brentford; he swears
3254	she's a witch; forbade her my house and hath
3255	threatened to beat her.
3256	
3257	MISTRESS PAGE	Heaven guide him to thy husband's cudgel, and the
3258	devil guide his cudgel afterwards!
3259	
3260	MISTRESS FORD	But is my husband coming?
3261	
3262	MISTRESS PAGE	Ah, in good sadness, is he; and talks of the basket
3263	too, howsoever he hath had intelligence.
3264	
3265	MISTRESS FORD	We'll try that; for I'll appoint my men to carry the
3266	basket again, to meet him at the door with it, as
3267	they did last time.
3268	
3269	MISTRESS PAGE	Nay, but he'll be here presently: let's go dress him
3270	like the witch of Brentford.
3271	
3272	MISTRESS FORD	I'll first direct my men what they shall do with the
3273	basket. Go up; I'll bring linen for him straight.
3274	
3275	[Exit]
3276	
3277	MISTRESS PAGE	Hang him, dishonest varlet! we cannot misuse him enough.
3278	We'll leave a proof, by that which we will do,
3279	Wives may be merry, and yet honest too:
3280	We do not act that often jest and laugh;
3281	'Tis old, but true, Still swine eat all the draff.

3287	MISTRESS FORD	Go, sirs, take the basket again on your shoulders:

3289	down, obey him: quickly, dispatch.
3290	
3291	[Exit]
3292	
3293	First Servant	Come, come, take it up.
3294	
3295	Second Servant	Pray heaven it be not full of knight again.
3296	
3297	First Servant	I hope not; I had as lief bear so much lead.
3298	
3299	[Enter FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and
3300	SIR HUGH EVANS]
3301	
3302	FORD	Ay, but if it prove true, Master Page, have you any
3303	way then to unfool me again? Set down the basket,
3304	villain! Somebody call my wife. Youth in a basket!
3305	O you panderly rascals! there's a knot, a ging, a
3306	pack, a conspiracy against me: now shall the devil
3307	be shamed. What, wife, I say! Come, come forth!
3308	Behold what honest clothes you send forth to bleaching!
3309	
3310	PAGE	Why, this passes, Master Ford; you are not to go
3311	loose any longer; you must be pinioned.
3312	
3313	SIR HUGH EVANS	Why, this is lunatics! this is mad as a mad dog!
3314	
3315	SHALLOW	Indeed, Master Ford, this is not well, indeed.
3316	
3317	FORD	So say I too, sir.
3318	
3319	[Re-enter MISTRESS FORD]
3320	
3321	Come hither, Mistress Ford; Mistress Ford the honest
3322	woman, the modest wife, the virtuous creature, that
3323	hath the jealous fool to her husband! I suspect
3324	without cause, mistress, do I?
3325	
3326	MISTRESS FORD	Heaven be my witness you do, if you suspect me in
3327	any dishonesty.
3328	
3329	FORD	Well said, brazen-face! hold it out. Come forth, sirrah!
3330	
3331	[Pulling clothes out of the basket]
3332	
3333	PAGE	This passes!
3334	
3335	MISTRESS FORD	Are you not ashamed? let the clothes alone.
3336	
3337	FORD	I shall find you anon.
3338	
3339	SIR HUGH EVANS	'Tis unreasonable! Will you take up your wife's
3340	clothes? Come away.
3341	
3342	FORD	Empty the basket, I say!
3343	
3344	MISTRESS FORD	Why, man, why?
3345	
3346	FORD	Master Page, as I am a man, there was one conveyed
3347	out of my house yesterday in this basket: why may
3348	not he be there again? In my house I am sure he is:
3349	my intelligence is true; my jealousy is reasonable.
3350	Pluck me out all the linen.
3351	
3352	MISTRESS FORD	If you find a man there, he shall die a flea's death.
3353	
3354	PAGE	Here's no man.
3355	
3356	SHALLOW	By my fidelity, this is not well, Master Ford; this
3357	wrongs you.
3358	
3359	SIR HUGH EVANS	Master Ford, you must pray, and not follow the
3360	imaginations of your own heart: this is jealousies.
3361	
3362	FORD	Well, he's not here I seek for.
3363	
3364	PAGE	No, nor nowhere else but in your brain.
3365	
3366	FORD	Help to search my house this one time. If I find
3367	not what I seek, show no colour for my extremity; let
3368	me for ever be your table-sport; let them say of
3369	me, 'As jealous as Ford, Chat searched a hollow
3370	walnut for his wife's leman.' Satisfy me once more;
3371	once more search with me.
3372	
3373	MISTRESS FORD	What, ho, Mistress Page! come you and the old woman
3374	down; my husband will come into the chamber.
3375	
3376	FORD	Old woman! what old woman's that?
3377	
3378	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, it is my maid's aunt of Brentford.
3379	
3380	FORD	A witch, a quean, an old cozening quean! Have I not
3381	forbid her my house? She comes of errands, does
3382	she? We are simple men; we do not know what's
3383	brought to pass under the profession of
3384	fortune-telling. She works by charms, by spells,
3385	by the figure, and such daubery as this is, beyond
3386	our element we know nothing. Come down, you witch,
3387	you hag, you; come down, I say!
3388	
3389	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, good, sweet husband! Good gentlemen, let him
3390	not strike the old woman.
3391	
3392	[Re-enter FALSTAFF in woman's clothes, and

3399	[Beating him]
3400	
3401	Out of my door, you witch, you hag, you baggage, you
3402	polecat, you runyon! out, out! I'll conjure you,
3403	I'll fortune-tell you.
3404	
3405	[Exit FALSTAFF]
3406	
3407	MISTRESS PAGE	Are you not ashamed? I think you have killed the
3408	poor woman.
3409	
3410	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, he will do it. 'Tis a goodly credit for you.
3411	
3412	FORD	Hang her, witch!
3413	
3414	SIR HUGH EVANS	By the yea and no, I think the 'oman is a witch
3415	indeed: I like not when a 'oman has a great peard;
3416	I spy a great peard under his muffler.
3417	
3418	FORD	Will you follow, gentlemen? I beseech you, follow;
3419	see but the issue of my jealousy: if I cry out thus
3420	upon no trail, never trust me when I open again.
3421	
3422	PAGE	Let's obey his humour a little further: come,
3423	gentlemen.
3424	
3425	[Exeunt FORD, PAGE, SHALLOW, DOCTOR CAIUS, and
3426	SIR HUGH EVANS]
3427	
3428	MISTRESS PAGE	Trust me, he beat him most pitifully.
3429	
3430	MISTRESS FORD	Nay, by the mass, that he did not; he beat him most
3431	unpitifully, methought.
3432	
3433	MISTRESS PAGE	I'll have the cudgel hallowed and hung o'er the
3434	altar; it hath done meritorious service.
3435	
3436	MISTRESS FORD	What think you? may we, with the warrant of
3437	womanhood and the witness of a good conscience,
3438	pursue him with any further revenge?
3439	
3440	MISTRESS PAGE	The spirit of wantonness is, sure, scared out of
3441	him: if the devil have him not in fee-simple, with
3442	fine and recovery, he will never, I think, in the
3443	way of waste, attempt us again.
3444	
3445	MISTRESS FORD	Shall we tell our husbands how we have served him?
3446	
3447	MISTRESS PAGE	Yes, by all means; if it be but to scrape the
3448	figures out of your husband's brains. If they can
3449	find in their hearts the poor unvirtuous fat knight
3450	shall be any further afflicted, we two will still be
3451	the ministers.
3452	
3453	MISTRESS FORD	I'll warrant they'll have him publicly shamed: and
3454	methinks there would be no period to the jest,
3455	should he not be publicly shamed.
3456

3458	not have things cool.

3480	
3481	Host	What duke should that be comes so secretly? I hear
3482	not of him in the court. Let me speak with the
3483	gentlemen: they speak English?
3484	
3485	BARDOLPH	Ay, sir; I'll call them to you.
3486	
3487	Host	They shall have my horses; but I'll make them pay;
3488	I'll sauce them: they have had my house a week at
3489	command; I have turned away my other guests: they

3506	
3507	[Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, MISTRESS FORD,
3508	and SIR HUGH EVANS]
3509	
3510	SIR HUGH EVANS	'Tis one of the best discretions of a 'oman as ever
3511	I did look upon.
3512	
3513	PAGE	And did he send you both these letters at an instant?
3514	
3515	MISTRESS PAGE	Within a quarter of an hour.
3516	
3517	FORD	Pardon me, wife. Henceforth do what thou wilt;
3518	I rather will suspect the sun with cold
3519	Than thee with wantonness: now doth thy honour stand
3520	In him that was of late an heretic,
3521	As firm as faith.
3522	
3523	PAGE	'Tis well, 'tis well; no more:
3524	Be not as extreme in submission
3525	As in offence.
3526	But let our plot go forward: let our wives
3527	Yet once again, to make us public sport,
3528	Appoint a meeting with this old fat fellow,
3529	Where we may take him and disgrace him for it.
3530	
3531	FORD	There is no better way than that they spoke of.
3532	
3533	PAGE	How? to send him word they'll meet him in the park
3534	at midnight? Fie, fie! he'll never come.
3535	
3536	SIR HUGH EVANS	You say he has been thrown in the rivers and has
3537	been grievously peaten as an old 'oman: methinks
3538	there should be terrors in him that he should not
3539	come; methinks his flesh is punished, he shall have
3540	no desires.
3541	
3542	PAGE	So think I too.
3543	
3544	MISTRESS FORD	Devise but how you'll use him when he comes,
3545	And let us two devise to bring him thither.
3546	
3547	MISTRESS PAGE	There is an old tale goes that Herne the hunter,
3548	Sometime a keeper here in Windsor forest,
3549	Doth all the winter-time, at still midnight,
3550	Walk round about an oak, with great ragg'd horns;
3551	And there he blasts the tree and takes the cattle
3552	And makes milch-kine yield blood and shakes a chain
3553	In a most hideous and dreadful manner:
3554	You have heard of such a spirit, and well you know
3555	The superstitious idle-headed eld
3556	Received and did deliver to our age
3557	This tale of Herne the hunter for a truth.
3558	
3559	PAGE	Why, yet there want not many that do fear
3560	In deep of night to walk by this Herne's oak:
3561	But what of this?
3562	
3563	MISTRESS FORD	                  Marry, this is our device;
3564	That Falstaff at that oak shall meet with us.
3565	
3566	PAGE	Well, let it not be doubted but he'll come:
3567	And in this shape when you have brought him thither,
3568	What shall be done with him? what is your plot?
3569	
3570	MISTRESS PAGE	That likewise have we thought upon, and thus:
3571	Nan Page my daughter and my little son
3572	And three or four more of their growth we'll dress
3573	Like urchins, ouphes and fairies, green and white,
3574	With rounds of waxen tapers on their heads,
3575	And rattles in their hands: upon a sudden,
3576	As Falstaff, she and I, are newly met,
3577	Let them from forth a sawpit rush at once
3578	With some diffused song: upon their sight,
3579	We two in great amazedness will fly:
3580	Then let them all encircle him about
3581	And, fairy-like, to-pinch the unclean knight,
3582	And ask him why, that hour of fairy revel,
3583	In their so sacred paths he dares to tread
3584	In shape profane.
3585	
3586	MISTRESS FORD	                  And till he tell the truth,
3587	Let the supposed fairies pinch him sound
3588	And burn him with their tapers.
3589	
3590	MISTRESS PAGE	The truth being known,
3591	We'll all present ourselves, dis-horn the spirit,
3592	And mock him home to Windsor.
3593	
3594	FORD	The children must
3595	Be practised well to this, or they'll ne'er do't.
3596	
3597	SIR HUGH EVANS	I will teach the children their behaviors; and I
3598	will be like a jack-an-apes also, to burn the
3599	knight with my taber.
3600	
3601	FORD	That will be excellent. I'll go and buy them vizards.
3602	
3603	MISTRESS PAGE	My Nan shall be the queen of all the fairies,
3604	Finely attired in a robe of white.
3605	
3606	PAGE	That silk will I go buy.
3607	
3608	[Aside]
3609	
3610	And in that time
3611	Shall Master Slender steal my Nan away
3612	And marry her at Eton. Go send to Falstaff straight.
3613	
3614	FORD	Nay I'll to him again in name of Brook
3615	He'll tell me all his purpose: sure, he'll come.
3616	
3617	MISTRESS PAGE	Fear not you that. Go get us properties
3618	And tricking for our fairies.
3619	
3620	SIR HUGH EVANS	Let us about it: it is admirable pleasures and fery
3621	honest knaveries.
3622	
3623	[Exeunt PAGE, FORD, and SIR HUGH EVANS]
3624	
3625	MISTRESS PAGE	Go, Mistress Ford,
3626	Send quickly to Sir John, to know his mind.
3627	
3628	[Exit MISTRESS FORD]
3629	
3630	I'll to the doctor: he hath my good will,
3631	And none but he, to marry with Nan Page.
3632	That Slender, though well landed, is an idiot;
3633	And he my husband best of all affects.
3634	The doctor is well money'd, and his friends
3635	Potent at court: he, none but he, shall have her,
3636	Though twenty thousand worthier come to crave her.

3656	speak, breathe, discuss; brief, short, quick, snap.
3657	
3658	SIMPLE	Marry, sir, I come to speak with Sir John Falstaff
3659	from Master Slender.
3660	
3661	Host	There's his chamber, his house, his castle, his
3662	standing-bed and truckle-bed; 'tis painted about
3663	with the story of the Prodigal, fresh and new. Go
3664	knock and call; hell speak like an Anthropophaginian
3665	unto thee: knock, I say.
3666	
3667	SIMPLE	There's an old woman, a fat woman, gone up into his
3668	chamber: I'll be so bold as stay, sir, till she come
3669	down; I come to speak with her, indeed.
3670	
3671	Host	Ha! a fat woman! the knight may be robbed: I'll
3672	call. Bully knight! bully Sir John! speak from
3673	thy lungs military: art thou there? it is thine
3674	host, thine Ephesian, calls.
3675	
3676	FALSTAFF	[Above]  How now, mine host!
3677	
3678	Host	Here's a Bohemian-Tartar tarries the coming down of
3679	thy fat woman. Let her descend, bully, let her
3680	descend; my chambers are honourable: fie! privacy?
3681	fie!

3692	
3693	SIMPLE	My master, sir, Master Slender, sent to her, seeing
3694	her go through the streets, to know, sir, whether
3695	one Nym, sir, that beguiled him of a chain, had the
3696	chain or no.
3697	
3698	FALSTAFF	I spake with the old woman about it.
3699	
3700	SIMPLE	And what says she, I pray, sir?
3701	
3702	FALSTAFF	Marry, she says that the very same man that
3703	beguiled Master Slender of his chain cozened him of
3704	it.
3705	
3706	SIMPLE	I would I could have spoken with the woman herself;
3707	I had other things to have spoken with her too from
3708	him.
3709	
3710	FALSTAFF	What are they? let us know.
3711	
3712	Host	Ay, come; quick.
3713	
3714	SIMPLE	I may not conceal them, sir.
3715	
3716	Host	Conceal them, or thou diest.
3717	
3718	SIMPLE	Why, sir, they were nothing but about Mistress Anne
3719	Page; to know if it were my master's fortune to
3720	have her or no.
3721	
3722	FALSTAFF	'Tis, 'tis his fortune.
3723	
3724	SIMPLE	What, sir?
3725	
3726	FALSTAFF	To have her, or no. Go; say the woman told me so.
3727	
3728	SIMPLE	May I be bold to say so, sir?
3729	
3730	FALSTAFF	Ay, sir; like who more bold.
3731	
3732	SIMPLE	I thank your worship: I shall make my master glad
3733	with these tidings.
3734	
3735	[Exit]
3736	
3737	Host	Thou art clerkly, thou art clerkly, Sir John. Was
3738	there a wise woman with thee?
3739	
3740	FALSTAFF	Ay, that there was, mine host; one that hath taught
3741	me more wit than ever I learned before in my life;
3742	and I paid nothing for it neither, but was paid for
3743	my learning.
3744	
3745	[Enter BARDOLPH]
3746	
3747	BARDOLPH	Out, alas, sir! cozenage, mere cozenage!
3748	
3749	Host	Where be my horses? speak well of them, varletto.
3750	
3751	BARDOLPH	Run away with the cozeners; for so soon as I came
3752	beyond Eton, they threw me off from behind one of
3753	them, in a slough of mire; and set spurs and away,
3754	like three German devils, three Doctor Faustuses.
3755	
3756	Host	They are gone but to meet the duke, villain: do not
3757	say they be fled; Germans are honest men.
3758	
3759	[Enter SIR HUGH EVANS]
3760	
3761	SIR HUGH EVANS	Where is mine host?
3762	
3763	Host	What is the matter, sir?
3764	
3765	SIR HUGH EVANS	Have a care of your entertainments: there is a
3766	friend of mine come to town tells me there is three
3767	cozen-germans that has cozened all the hosts of
3768	Readins, of Maidenhead, of Colebrook, of horses and
3769	money. I tell you for good will, look you: you
3770	are wise and full of gibes and vlouting-stocks, and
3771	'tis not convenient you should be cozened. Fare you well.
3772	
3773	[Exit]
3774	
3775	[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]
3776	
3777	DOCTOR CAIUS	Vere is mine host de Jarteer?
3778	
3779	Host	Here, master doctor, in perplexity and doubtful dilemma.
3780	
3781	DOCTOR CAIUS	I cannot tell vat is dat: but it is tell-a me dat
3782	you make grand preparation for a duke de Jamany: by
3783	my trot, dere is no duke dat the court is know to
3784	come. I tell you for good vill: adieu.
3785	
3786	[Exit]
3787	
3788	Host	Hue and cry, villain, go! Assist me, knight. I am
3789	undone! Fly, run, hue and cry, villain! I am undone!
3790	
3791	[Exeunt Host and BARDOLPH]
3792	
3793	FALSTAFF	I would all the world might be cozened; for I have
3794	been cozened and beaten too. If it should come to
3795	the ear of the court, how I have been transformed
3796	and how my transformation hath been washed and
3797	cudgelled, they would melt me out of my fat drop by
3798	drop and liquor fishermen's boots with me; I warrant
3799	they would whip me with their fine wits till I were
3800	as crest-fallen as a dried pear. I never prospered
3801	since I forswore myself at primero. Well, if my
3802	wind were but long enough to say my prayers, I would repent.
3803	
3804	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY]
3805	
3806	Now, whence come you?
3807	
3808	MISTRESS QUICKLY	From the two parties, forsooth.
3809	
3810	FALSTAFF	The devil take one party and his dam the other! and
3811	so they shall be both bestowed. I have suffered more
3812	for their sakes, more than the villanous inconstancy
3813	of man's disposition is able to bear.
3814	
3815	MISTRESS QUICKLY	And have not they suffered? Yes, I warrant;
3816	speciously one of them; Mistress Ford, good heart,
3817	is beaten black and blue, that you cannot see a
3818	white spot about her.
3819	
3820	FALSTAFF	What tellest thou me of black and blue? I was
3821	beaten myself into all the colours of the rainbow;
3822	and I was like to be apprehended for the witch of
3823	Brentford: but that my admirable dexterity of wit,
3824	my counterfeiting the action of an old woman,
3825	delivered me, the knave constable had set me i' the
3826	stocks, i' the common stocks, for a witch.
3827	
3828	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sir, let me speak with you in your chamber: you
3829	shall hear how things go; and, I warrant, to your
3830	content. Here is a letter will say somewhat. Good
3831	hearts, what ado here is to bring you together!
3832	Sure, one of you does not serve heaven well, that
3833	you are so crossed.
3834	
3835	FALSTAFF	Come up into my chamber.

3852	[Enter FENTON and Host]
3853	
3854	Host	Master Fenton, talk not to me; my mind is heavy: I
3855	will give over all.
3856	
3857	FENTON	Yet hear me speak. Assist me in my purpose,
3858	And, as I am a gentleman, I'll give thee
3859	A hundred pound in gold more than your loss.
3860	
3861	Host	I will hear you, Master Fenton; and I will at the
3862	least keep your counsel.
3863	
3864	FENTON	From time to time I have acquainted you
3865	With the dear love I bear to fair Anne Page;
3866	Who mutually hath answer'd my affection,
3867	So far forth as herself might be her chooser,
3868	Even to my wish: I have a letter from her
3869	Of such contents as you will wonder at;
3870	The mirth whereof so larded with my matter,
3871	That neither singly can be manifested,
3872	Without the show of both; fat Falstaff
3873	Hath a great scene: the image of the jest
3874	I'll show you here at large. Hark, good mine host.
3875	To-night at Herne's oak, just 'twixt twelve and one,
3876	Must my sweet Nan present the Fairy Queen;
3877	The purpose why, is here: in which disguise,
3878	While other jests are something rank on foot,
3879	Her father hath commanded her to slip
3880	Away with Slender and with him at Eton
3881	Immediately to marry: she hath consented: Now, sir,
3882	Her mother, ever strong against that match
3883	And firm for Doctor Caius, hath appointed
3884	That he shall likewise shuffle her away,
3885	While other sports are tasking of their minds,
3886	And at the deanery, where a priest attends,
3887	Straight marry her: to this her mother's plot
3888	She seemingly obedient likewise hath
3889	Made promise to the doctor. Now, thus it rests:
3890	Her father means she shall be all in white,
3891	And in that habit, when Slender sees his time
3892	To take her by the hand and bid her go,
3893	She shall go with him: her mother hath intended,
3894	The better to denote her to the doctor,
3895	For they must all be mask'd and vizarded,
3896	That quaint in green she shall be loose enrobed,
3897	With ribands pendent, flaring 'bout her head;
3898	And when the doctor spies his vantage ripe,
3899	To pinch her by the hand, and, on that token,
3900	The maid hath given consent to go with him.
3901	
3902	Host	Which means she to deceive, father or mother?
3903	
3904	FENTON	Both, my good host, to go along with me:
3905	And here it rests, that you'll procure the vicar
3906	To stay for me at church 'twixt twelve and one,
3907	And, in the lawful name of marrying,
3908	To give our hearts united ceremony.
3909	
3910	Host	Well, husband your device; I'll to the vicar:
3911	Bring you the maid, you shall not lack a priest.
3912	
3913	FENTON	So shall I evermore be bound to thee;
3914	Besides, I'll make a present recompense.

3932	
3933	FALSTAFF	Prithee, no more prattling; go. I'll hold. This is
3934	the third time; I hope good luck lies in odd
3935	numbers. Away I go. They say there is divinity in
3936	odd numbers, either in nativity, chance, or death. Away!
3937	
3938	MISTRESS QUICKLY	I'll provide you a chain; and I'll do what I can to
3939	get you a pair of horns.
3940	
3941	FALSTAFF	Away, I say; time wears: hold up your head, and mince.
3942

3949	Park about midnight, at Herne's oak, and you shall
3950	see wonders.
3951	
3952	FORD	Went you not to her yesterday, sir, as you told me
3953	you had appointed?
3954	
3955	FALSTAFF	I went to her, Master Brook, as you see, like a poor
3956	old man: but I came from her, Master Brook, like a
3957	poor old woman. That same knave Ford, her husband,
3958	hath the finest mad devil of jealousy in him,
3959	Master Brook, that ever governed frenzy. I will tell
3960	you: he beat me grievously, in the shape of a
3961	woman; for in the shape of man, Master Brook, I fear
3962	not Goliath with a weaver's beam; because I know
3963	also life is a shuttle. I am in haste; go along
3964	with me: I'll tell you all, Master Brook. Since I
3965	plucked geese, played truant and whipped top, I knew
3966	not what 'twas to be beaten till lately. Follow
3967	me: I'll tell you strange things of this knave
3968	Ford, on whom to-night I will be revenged, and I
3969	will deliver his wife into your hand. Follow.
3970	Strange things in hand, Master Brook! Follow.

3991	my daughter.
3992	
3993	SLENDER	Ay, forsooth; I have spoke with her and we have a
3994	nay-word how to know one another: I come to her in
3995	white, and cry 'mum;' she cries 'budget;' and by
3996	that we know one another.
3997	
3998	SHALLOW	That's good too: but what needs either your 'mum'
3999	or her 'budget?' the white will decipher her well
4000	enough. It hath struck ten o'clock.

4047	display to the night.

4100	FALSTAFF	The Windsor bell hath struck twelve; the minute
4101	draws on. Now, the hot-blooded gods assist me!
4102	Remember, Jove, thou wast a bull for thy Europa; love
4103	set on thy horns. O powerful love! that, in some
4104	respects, makes a beast a man, in some other, a man
4105	a beast. You were also, Jupiter, a swan for the love
4106	of Leda. O omnipotent Love! how near the god drew
4107	to the complexion of a goose! A fault done first in
4108	the form of a beast. O Jove, a beastly fault! And
4109	then another fault in the semblance of a fowl; think
4110	on 't, Jove; a foul fault! When gods have hot
4111	backs, what shall poor men do? For me, I am here a
4112	Windsor stag; and the fattest, I think, i' the
4113	forest. Send me a cool rut-time, Jove, or who can
4114	blame me to piss my tallow? Who comes here? my
4115	doe?

4122	potatoes; let it thunder to the tune of Green
4123	Sleeves, hail kissing-comfits and snow eringoes; let
4124	there come a tempest of provocation, I will shelter me here.
4125	
4126	MISTRESS FORD	Mistress Page is come with me, sweetheart.
4127	
4128	FALSTAFF	Divide me like a bribe buck, each a haunch: I will
4129	keep my sides to myself, my shoulders for the fellow
4130	of this walk, and my horns I bequeath your husbands.
4131	Am I a woodman, ha? Speak I like Herne the hunter?
4132	Why, now is Cupid a child of conscience; he makes
4133	restitution. As I am a true spirit, welcome!

4169	Our radiant queen hates sluts and sluttery.

4180	But those as sleep and think not on their sins,
4181	Pinch them, arms, legs, backs, shoulders, sides and shins.
4182	
4183	MISTRESS QUICKLY	About, about;
4184	Search Windsor Castle, elves, within and out:
4185	Strew good luck, ouphes, on every sacred room:
4186	That it may stand till the perpetual doom,
4187	In state as wholesome as in state 'tis fit,
4188	Worthy the owner, and the owner it.
4189	The several chairs of order look you scour
4190	With juice of balm and every precious flower:
4191	Each fair instalment, coat, and several crest,
4192	With loyal blazon, evermore be blest!
4193	And nightly, meadow-fairies, look you sing,
4194	Like to the Garter's compass, in a ring:
4195	The expressure that it bears, green let it be,
4196	More fertile-fresh than all the field to see;
4197	And 'Honi soit qui mal y pense' write
4198	In emerald tufts, flowers purple, blue and white;
4199	Let sapphire, pearl and rich embroidery,
4200	Buckled below fair knighthood's bending knee:
4201	Fairies use flowers for their charactery.
4202	Away; disperse: but till 'tis one o'clock,
4203	Our dance of custom round about the oak
4204	Of Herne the hunter, let us not forget.
4205	
4206	SIR HUGH EVANS	Pray you, lock hand in hand; yourselves in order set
4207	And twenty glow-worms shall our lanterns be,
4208	To guide our measure round about the tree.
4209	But, stay; I smell a man of middle-earth.
4210	
4211	FALSTAFF	Heavens defend me from that Welsh fairy, lest he
4212	transform me to a piece of cheese!
4213	
4214	PISTOL	Vile worm, thou wast o'erlook'd even in thy birth.
4215	
4216	MISTRESS QUICKLY	With trial-fire touch me his finger-end:
4217	If he be chaste, the flame will back descend
4218	And turn him to no pain; but if he start,
4219	It is the flesh of a corrupted heart.
4220	
4221	PISTOL	A trial, come.

4223	SIR HUGH EVANS	Come, will this wood take fire?
4224	
4225	[They burn him with their tapers]
4226	
4227	FALSTAFF	Oh, Oh, Oh!
4228	
4229	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Corrupt, corrupt, and tainted in desire!
4230	About him, fairies; sing a scornful rhyme;
4231	And, as you trip, still pinch him to your time.
4232	
4233	SONG.
4234	Fie on sinful fantasy!
4235	Fie on lust and luxury!
4236	Lust is but a bloody fire,
4237	Kindled with unchaste desire,
4238	Fed in heart, whose flames aspire
4239	As thoughts do blow them, higher and higher.
4240	Pinch him, fairies, mutually;
4241	Pinch him for his villany;
4242	Pinch him, and burn him, and turn him about,
4243	Till candles and starlight and moonshine be out.
4244	
4245	[During this song they pinch FALSTAFF. DOCTOR CAIUS
4246	comes one way, and steals away a boy in green;
4247	SLENDER another way, and takes off a boy in white;
4248	and FENTON comes and steals away ANN PAGE.
4249	A noise of hunting is heard within. All the
4250	Fairies run away. FALSTAFF pulls off his buck's
4251	head, and rises]
4252	
4253	[Enter PAGE, FORD, MISTRESS PAGE, and MISTRESS FORD]
4254	
4255	PAGE	Nay, do not fly; I think we have watch'd you now
4256	Will none but Herne the hunter serve your turn?
4257	
4258	MISTRESS PAGE	I pray you, come, hold up the jest no higher
4259	Now, good Sir John, how like you Windsor wives?
4260	See you these, husband? do not these fair yokes
4261	Become the forest better than the town?
4262	
4263	FORD	Now, sir, who's a cuckold now? Master Brook,
4264	Falstaff's a knave, a cuckoldly knave; here are his
4265	horns, Master Brook: and, Master Brook, he hath
4266	enjoyed nothing of Ford's but his buck-basket, his
4267	cudgel, and twenty pounds of money, which must be
4268	paid to Master Brook; his horses are arrested for
4269	it, Master Brook.
4270	
4271	MISTRESS FORD	Sir John, we have had ill luck; we could never meet.
4272	I will never take you for my love again; but I will
4273	always count you my deer.
4274	
4275	FALSTAFF	I do begin to perceive that I am made an ass.
4276	
4277	FORD	Ay, and an ox too: both the proofs are extant.
4278	
4279	FALSTAFF	And these are not fairies? I was three or four
4280	times in the thought they were not fairies: and yet
4281	the guiltiness of my mind, the sudden surprise of my
4282	powers, drove the grossness of the foppery into a
4283	received belief, in despite of the teeth of all
4284	rhyme and reason, that they were fairies. See now
4285	how wit may be made a Jack-a-Lent, when 'tis upon
4286	ill employment!
4287	
4288	SIR HUGH EVANS	Sir John Falstaff, serve Got, and leave your
4289	desires, and fairies will not pinse you.
4290	
4291	FORD	Well said, fairy Hugh.
4292	
4293	SIR HUGH EVANS	And leave your jealousies too, I pray you.
4294	
4295	FORD	I will never mistrust my wife again till thou art
4296	able to woo her in good English.
4297	
4298	FALSTAFF	Have I laid my brain in the sun and dried it, that
4299	it wants matter to prevent so gross o'erreaching as
4300	this? Am I ridden with a Welsh goat too? shall I
4301	have a coxcomb of frize? 'Tis time I were choked
4302	with a piece of toasted cheese.
4303	
4304	SIR HUGH EVANS	Seese is not good to give putter; your belly is all putter.
4305	
4306	FALSTAFF	'Seese' and 'putter'! have I lived to stand at the
4307	taunt of one that makes fritters of English? This
4308	is enough to be the decay of lust and late-walking
4309	through the realm.
4310	
4311	MISTRESS PAGE	Why Sir John, do you think, though we would have the
4312	virtue out of our hearts by the head and shoulders
4313	and have given ourselves without scruple to hell,
4314	that ever the devil could have made you our delight?
4315	
4316	FORD	What, a hodge-pudding? a bag of flax?
4317	
4318	MISTRESS PAGE	A puffed man?
4319	
4320	PAGE	Old, cold, withered and of intolerable entrails?
4321	
4322	FORD	And one that is as slanderous as Satan?
4323	
4324	PAGE	And as poor as Job?
4325	
4326	FORD	And as wicked as his wife?
4327	
4328	SIR HUGH EVANS	And given to fornications, and to taverns and sack
4329	and wine and metheglins, and to drinkings and
4330	swearings and starings, pribbles and prabbles?
4331	
4332	FALSTAFF	Well, I am your theme: you have the start of me; I
4333	am dejected; I am not able to answer the Welsh
4334	flannel; ignorance itself is a plummet o'er me: use
4335	me as you will.
4336	
4337	FORD	Marry, sir, we'll bring you to Windsor, to one
4338	Master Brook, that you have cozened of money, to
4339	whom you should have been a pander: over and above
4340	that you have suffered, I think to repay that money
4341	will be a biting affliction.
4342	
4343	PAGE	Yet be cheerful, knight: thou shalt eat a posset
4344	to-night at my house; where I will desire thee to
4345	laugh at my wife, that now laughs at thee: tell her
4346	Master Slender hath married her daughter.
4347	
4348	MISTRESS PAGE	[Aside]  Doctors doubt that: if Anne Page be my
4349	daughter, she is, by this, Doctor Caius' wife.
4350	
4351	[Enter SLENDER]
4352	
4353	SLENDER	Whoa ho! ho, father Page!
4354	
4355	PAGE	Son, how now! how now, son! have you dispatched?
4356	
4357	SLENDER	Dispatched! I'll make the best in Gloucestershire
4358	know on't; would I were hanged, la, else.
4359	
4360	PAGE	Of what, son?
4361	
4362	SLENDER	I came yonder at Eton to marry Mistress Anne Page,
4363	and she's a great lubberly boy. If it had not been
4364	i' the church, I would have swinged him, or he
4365	should have swinged me. If I did not think it had
4366	been Anne Page, would I might never stir!--and 'tis
4367	a postmaster's boy.
4368	
4369	PAGE	Upon my life, then, you took the wrong.
4370	
4371	SLENDER	What need you tell me that? I think so, when I took
4372	a boy for a girl. If I had been married to him, for
4373	all he was in woman's apparel, I would not have had
4374	him.
4375	
4376	PAGE	Why, this is your own folly. Did not I tell you how
4377	you should know my daughter by her garments?
4378	
4379	SLENDER	I went to her in white, and cried 'mum,' and she
4380	cried 'budget,' as Anne and I had appointed; and yet
4381	it was not Anne, but a postmaster's boy.
4382	
4383	MISTRESS PAGE	Good George, be not angry: I knew of your purpose;
4384	turned my daughter into green; and, indeed, she is
4385	now with the doctor at the deanery, and there married.
4386	
4387	[Enter DOCTOR CAIUS]
4388	
4389	DOCTOR CAIUS	Vere is Mistress Page? By gar, I am cozened: I ha'
4390	married un garcon, a boy; un paysan, by gar, a boy;
4391	it is not Anne Page: by gar, I am cozened.
4392	
4393	MISTRESS PAGE	Why, did you take her in green?
4394	
4395	DOCTOR CAIUS	Ay, by gar, and 'tis a boy: by gar, I'll raise all Windsor.
4396	
4397	[Exit]
4398	
4399	FORD	This is strange. Who hath got the right Anne?
4400	
4401	PAGE	My heart misgives me: here comes Master Fenton.
4402	
4403	[Enter FENTON and ANNE PAGE]
4404	
4405	How now, Master Fenton!
4406	
4407	ANNE PAGE	Pardon, good father! good my mother, pardon!
4408	
4409	PAGE	Now, mistress, how chance you went not with Master Slender?
4410	
4411	MISTRESS PAGE	Why went you not with master doctor, maid?
4412	
4413	FENTON	You do amaze her: hear the truth of it.
4414	You would have married her most shamefully,
4415	Where there was no proportion held in love.
4416	The truth is, she and I, long since contracted,
4417	Are now so sure that nothing can dissolve us.
4418	The offence is holy that she hath committed;
4419	And this deceit loses the name of craft,
4420	Of disobedience, or unduteous title,
4421	Since therein she doth evitate and shun
4422	A thousand irreligious cursed hours,
4423	Which forced marriage would have brought upon her.
4424	
4425	FORD	Stand not amazed; here is no remedy:
4426	In love the heavens themselves do guide the state;
4427	Money buys lands, and wives are sold by fate.
4428	
4429	FALSTAFF	I am glad, though you have ta'en a special stand to
4430	strike at me, that your arrow hath glanced.
4431	
4432	PAGE	Well, what remedy? Fenton, heaven give thee joy!
4433	What cannot be eschew'd must be embraced.
4434	
4435	FALSTAFF	When night-dogs run, all sorts of deer are chased.
4436	
4437	MISTRESS PAGE	Well, I will muse no further. Master Fenton,
4438	Heaven give you many, many merry days!
4439	Good husband, let us every one go home,
4440	And laugh this sport o'er by a country fire;
4441	Sir John and all.
4442	
4443	FORD	                  Let it be so. Sir John,
4444	To Master Brook you yet shall hold your word
4445	For he tonight shall lie with Mistress Ford.
4446	
4447	[Exeunt]

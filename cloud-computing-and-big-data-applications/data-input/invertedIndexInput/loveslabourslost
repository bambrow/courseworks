61	
62	
63	SCENE I	The king of Navarre's park.
64	
65	
66	[Enter FERDINAND king of Navarre, BIRON, LONGAVILLE
67	and DUMAIN]
68	
69	FERDINAND	Let fame, that all hunt after in their lives,
70	Live register'd upon our brazen tombs
71	And then grace us in the disgrace of death;
72	When, spite of cormorant devouring Time,
73	The endeavor of this present breath may buy
74	That honour which shall bate his scythe's keen edge
75	And make us heirs of all eternity.
76	Therefore, brave conquerors,--for so you are,
77	That war against your own affections
78	And the huge army of the world's desires,--
79	Our late edict shall strongly stand in force:
80	Navarre shall be the wonder of the world;
81	Our court shall be a little Academe,
82	Still and contemplative in living art.
83	You three, Biron, Dumain, and Longaville,
84	Have sworn for three years' term to live with me
85	My fellow-scholars, and to keep those statutes
86	That are recorded in this schedule here:
87	Your oaths are pass'd; and now subscribe your names,
88	That his own hand may strike his honour down
89	That violates the smallest branch herein:
90	If you are arm'd to do as sworn to do,
91	Subscribe to your deep oaths, and keep it too.
92	
93	LONGAVILLE	I am resolved; 'tis but a three years' fast:
94	The mind shall banquet, though the body pine:
95	Fat paunches have lean pates, and dainty bits
96	Make rich the ribs, but bankrupt quite the wits.
97	
98	DUMAIN	My loving lord, Dumain is mortified:
99	The grosser manner of these world's delights
100	He throws upon the gross world's baser slaves:
101	To love, to wealth, to pomp, I pine and die;
102	With all these living in philosophy.
103	
104	BIRON	I can but say their protestation over;
105	So much, dear liege, I have already sworn,
106	That is, to live and study here three years.
107	But there are other strict observances;
108	As, not to see a woman in that term,
109	Which I hope well is not enrolled there;
110	And one day in a week to touch no food
111	And but one meal on every day beside,
112	The which I hope is not enrolled there;
113	And then, to sleep but three hours in the night,
114	And not be seen to wink of all the day--
115	When I was wont to think no harm all night
116	And make a dark night too of half the day--
117	Which I hope well is not enrolled there:
118	O, these are barren tasks, too hard to keep,
119	Not to see ladies, study, fast, not sleep!
120	
121	FERDINAND	Your oath is pass'd to pass away from these.
122	
123	BIRON	Let me say no, my liege, an if you please:
124	I only swore to study with your grace
125	And stay here in your court for three years' space.
126	
127	LONGAVILLE	You swore to that, Biron, and to the rest.
128	
129	BIRON	By yea and nay, sir, then I swore in jest.
130	What is the end of study? let me know.
131	
132	FERDINAND	Why, that to know, which else we should not know.
133	
134	BIRON	Things hid and barr'd, you mean, from common sense?
135	
136	FERDINAND	Ay, that is study's godlike recompense.
137	
138	BIRON	Come on, then; I will swear to study so,
139	To know the thing I am forbid to know:
140	As thus,--to study where I well may dine,
141	When I to feast expressly am forbid;
142	Or study where to meet some mistress fine,
143	When mistresses from common sense are hid;
144	Or, having sworn too hard a keeping oath,
145	Study to break it and not break my troth.
146	If study's gain be thus and this be so,
147	Study knows that which yet it doth not know:
148	Swear me to this, and I will ne'er say no.
149	
150	FERDINAND	These be the stops that hinder study quite
151	And train our intellects to vain delight.
152	
153	BIRON	Why, all delights are vain; but that most vain,
154	Which with pain purchased doth inherit pain:
155	As, painfully to pore upon a book
156	To seek the light of truth; while truth the while
157	Doth falsely blind the eyesight of his look:
158	Light seeking light doth light of light beguile:
159	So, ere you find where light in darkness lies,
160	Your light grows dark by losing of your eyes.
161	Study me how to please the eye indeed
162	By fixing it upon a fairer eye,
163	Who dazzling so, that eye shall be his heed
164	And give him light that it was blinded by.
165	Study is like the heaven's glorious sun
166	That will not be deep-search'd with saucy looks:
167	Small have continual plodders ever won
168	Save base authority from others' books
169	These earthly godfathers of heaven's lights
170	That give a name to every fixed star
171	Have no more profit of their shining nights
172	Than those that walk and wot not what they are.
173	Too much to know is to know nought but fame;
174	And every godfather can give a name.
175	
176	FERDINAND	How well he's read, to reason against reading!
177	
178	DUMAIN	Proceeded well, to stop all good proceeding!
179	
180	LONGAVILLE	He weeds the corn and still lets grow the weeding.
181	
182	BIRON	The spring is near when green geese are a-breeding.
183	
184	DUMAIN	How follows that?
185	
186	BIRON	                  Fit in his place and time.
187	
188	DUMAIN	In reason nothing.
189	
190	BIRON	                  Something then in rhyme.
191	
192	FERDINAND	Biron is like an envious sneaping frost,
193	That bites the first-born infants of the spring.
194	
195	BIRON	Well, say I am; why should proud summer boast
196	Before the birds have any cause to sing?
197	Why should I joy in any abortive birth?
198	At Christmas I no more desire a rose
199	Than wish a snow in May's new-fangled mirth;
200	But like of each thing that in season grows.
201	So you, to study now it is too late,
202	Climb o'er the house to unlock the little gate.
203	
204	FERDINAND	Well, sit you out: go home, Biron: adieu.
205	
206	BIRON	No, my good lord; I have sworn to stay with you:
207	And though I have for barbarism spoke more
208	Than for that angel knowledge you can say,
209	Yet confident I'll keep what I have swore
210	And bide the penance of each three years' day.
211	Give me the paper; let me read the same;
212	And to the strict'st decrees I'll write my name.
213	
214	FERDINAND	How well this yielding rescues thee from shame!
215	
216	BIRON	[Reads]  'Item, That no woman shall come within a
217	mile of my court:' Hath this been proclaimed?
218	
219	LONGAVILLE	Four days ago.
220	
221	BIRON	Let's see the penalty.
222	
223	[Reads]
224	
225	'On pain of losing her tongue.' Who devised this penalty?
226	
227	LONGAVILLE	Marry, that did I.
228	
229	BIRON	Sweet lord, and why?
230	
231	LONGAVILLE	To fright them hence with that dread penalty.
232	
233	BIRON	A dangerous law against gentility!
234	
235	[Reads]
236	
237	'Item, If any man be seen to talk with a woman
238	within the term of three years, he shall endure such
239	public shame as the rest of the court can possibly devise.'
240	This article, my liege, yourself must break;
241	For well you know here comes in embassy
242	The French king's daughter with yourself to speak--
243	A maid of grace and complete majesty--
244	About surrender up of Aquitaine
245	To her decrepit, sick and bedrid father:
246	Therefore this article is made in vain,
247	Or vainly comes the admired princess hither.
248	
249	FERDINAND	What say you, lords? Why, this was quite forgot.
250	
251	BIRON	So study evermore is overshot:
252	While it doth study to have what it would
253	It doth forget to do the thing it should,
254	And when it hath the thing it hunteth most,
255	'Tis won as towns with fire, so won, so lost.
256	
257	FERDINAND	We must of force dispense with this decree;
258	She must lie here on mere necessity.
259	
260	BIRON	Necessity will make us all forsworn
261	Three thousand times within this three years' space;
262	For every man with his affects is born,
263	Not by might master'd but by special grace:
264	If I break faith, this word shall speak for me;
265	I am forsworn on 'mere necessity.'
266	So to the laws at large I write my name:
267	
268	[Subscribes]
269	
270	And he that breaks them in the least degree
271	Stands in attainder of eternal shame:
272	Suggestions are to other as to me;
273	But I believe, although I seem so loath,
274	I am the last that will last keep his oath.
275	But is there no quick recreation granted?
276	
277	FERDINAND	Ay, that there is. Our court, you know, is haunted
278	With a refined traveller of Spain;
279	A man in all the world's new fashion planted,
280	That hath a mint of phrases in his brain;
281	One whom the music of his own vain tongue
282	Doth ravish like enchanting harmony;
283	A man of complements, whom right and wrong
284	Have chose as umpire of their mutiny:
285	This child of fancy, that Armado hight,
286	For interim to our studies shall relate
287	In high-born words the worth of many a knight
288	From tawny Spain lost in the world's debate.
289	How you delight, my lords, I know not, I;
290	But, I protest, I love to hear him lie
291	And I will use him for my minstrelsy.
292	
293	BIRON	Armado is a most illustrious wight,
294	A man of fire-new words, fashion's own knight.
295	
296	LONGAVILLE	Costard the swain and he shall be our sport;
297	And so to study, three years is but short.
298	
299	[Enter DULL with a letter, and COSTARD]
300	
301	DULL	Which is the duke's own person?
302	
303	BIRON	This, fellow: what wouldst?
304	
305	DULL	I myself reprehend his own person, for I am his
306	grace's tharborough: but I would see his own person
307	in flesh and blood.
308	
309	BIRON	This is he.
310	
311	DULL	Signior Arme--Arme--commends you. There's villany
312	abroad: this letter will tell you more.
313	
314	COSTARD	Sir, the contempts thereof are as touching me.
315	
316	FERDINAND	A letter from the magnificent Armado.
317	
318	BIRON	How low soever the matter, I hope in God for high words.
319	
320	LONGAVILLE	A high hope for a low heaven: God grant us patience!
321	
322	BIRON	To hear? or forbear laughing?
323	
324	LONGAVILLE	To hear meekly, sir, and to laugh moderately; or to
325	forbear both.
326	
327	BIRON	Well, sir, be it as the style shall give us cause to
328	climb in the merriness.
329	
330	COSTARD	The matter is to me, sir, as concerning Jaquenetta.
331	The manner of it is, I was taken with the manner.
332	
333	BIRON	In what manner?
334	
335	COSTARD	In manner and form following, sir; all those three:
336	I was seen with her in the manor-house, sitting with
337	her upon the form, and taken following her into the
338	park; which, put together, is in manner and form
339	following. Now, sir, for the manner,--it is the
340	manner of a man to speak to a woman: for the form,--
341	in some form.
342	
343	BIRON	For the following, sir?
344	
345	COSTARD	As it shall follow in my correction: and God defend
346	the right!
347	
348	FERDINAND	Will you hear this letter with attention?
349	
350	BIRON	As we would hear an oracle.
351	
352	COSTARD	Such is the simplicity of man to hearken after the flesh.
353	
354	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'Great deputy, the welkin's vicegerent and
355	sole dominator of Navarre, my soul's earth's god,
356	and body's fostering patron.'
357	
358	COSTARD	Not a word of Costard yet.
359	
360	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'So it is,'--
361	
362	COSTARD	It may be so: but if he say it is so, he is, in
363	telling true, but so.
364	
365	FERDINAND	Peace!
366	
367	COSTARD	Be to me and every man that dares not fight!
368	
369	FERDINAND	No words!
370	
371	COSTARD	Of other men's secrets, I beseech you.
372	
373	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'So it is, besieged with sable-coloured
374	melancholy, I did commend the black-oppressing humour
375	to the most wholesome physic of thy health-giving
376	air; and, as I am a gentleman, betook myself to
377	walk. The time when. About the sixth hour; when
378	beasts most graze, birds best peck, and men sit down
379	to that nourishment which is called supper: so much
380	for the time when. Now for the ground which; which,
381	I mean, I walked upon: it is y-cleped thy park. Then
382	for the place where; where, I mean, I did encounter
383	that obscene and preposterous event, that draweth
384	from my snow-white pen the ebon-coloured ink, which
385	here thou viewest, beholdest, surveyest, or seest;
386	but to the place where; it standeth north-north-east
387	and by east from the west corner of thy curious-
388	knotted garden: there did I see that low-spirited
389	swain, that base minnow of thy mirth,'--
390	
391	COSTARD	Me?
392	
393	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'that unlettered small-knowing soul,'--
394	
395	COSTARD	Me?
396	
397	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'that shallow vassal,'--
398	
399	COSTARD	Still me?
400	
401	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'which, as I remember, hight Costard,'--
402	
403	COSTARD	O, me!
404	
405	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'sorted and consorted, contrary to thy
406	established proclaimed edict and continent canon,
407	which with,--O, with--but with this I passion to say
408	wherewith,--
409	
410	COSTARD	With a wench.
411	
412	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'with a child of our grandmother Eve, a
413	female; or, for thy more sweet understanding, a
414	woman. Him I, as my ever-esteemed duty pricks me on,
415	have sent to thee, to receive the meed of
416	punishment, by thy sweet grace's officer, Anthony
417	Dull; a man of good repute, carriage, bearing, and
418	estimation.'
419	
420	DULL	'Me, an't shall please you; I am Anthony Dull.
421	
422	FERDINAND	[Reads]  'For Jaquenetta,--so is the weaker vessel
423	called which I apprehended with the aforesaid
424	swain,--I keep her as a vessel of the law's fury;
425	and shall, at the least of thy sweet notice, bring
426	her to trial. Thine, in all compliments of devoted
427	and heart-burning heat of duty.
428	DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
429	
430	BIRON	This is not so well as I looked for, but the best
431	that ever I heard.
432	
433	FERDINAND	Ay, the best for the worst. But, sirrah, what say
434	you to this?
435	
436	COSTARD	Sir, I confess the wench.
437	
438	FERDINAND	Did you hear the proclamation?
439	
440	COSTARD	I do confess much of the hearing it but little of
441	the marking of it.
442	
443	FERDINAND	It was proclaimed a year's imprisonment, to be taken
444	with a wench.
445	
446	COSTARD	I was taken with none, sir: I was taken with a damsel.
447	
448	FERDINAND	Well, it was proclaimed 'damsel.'
449	
450	COSTARD	This was no damsel, neither, sir; she was a virgin.
451	
452	FERDINAND	It is so varied, too; for it was proclaimed 'virgin.'
453	
454	COSTARD	If it were, I deny her virginity: I was taken with a maid.
455	
456	FERDINAND	This maid will not serve your turn, sir.
457	
458	COSTARD	This maid will serve my turn, sir.
459	
460	FERDINAND	Sir, I will pronounce your sentence: you shall fast
461	a week with bran and water.
462	
463	COSTARD	I had rather pray a month with mutton and porridge.
464	
465	FERDINAND	And Don Armado shall be your keeper.
466	My Lord Biron, see him deliver'd o'er:
467	And go we, lords, to put in practise that
468	Which each to other hath so strongly sworn.
469	
470	[Exeunt FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN]
471	
472	BIRON	I'll lay my head to any good man's hat,
473	These oaths and laws will prove an idle scorn.
474	Sirrah, come on.
475	
476	COSTARD	I suffer for the truth, sir; for true it is, I was
477	taken with Jaquenetta, and Jaquenetta is a true
478	girl; and therefore welcome the sour cup of
479	prosperity! Affliction may one day smile again; and
480	till then, sit thee down, sorrow!

495	
496	
497	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH]
498	
499	DON
500	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Boy, what sign is it when a man of great spirit
501	grows melancholy?
502	
503	MOTH	A great sign, sir, that he will look sad.
504	
505	DON
506	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Why, sadness is one and the self-same thing, dear imp.
507	
508	MOTH	No, no; O Lord, sir, no.
509	
510	DON
511	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How canst thou part sadness and melancholy, my
512	tender juvenal?
513	
514	MOTH	By a familiar demonstration of the working, my tough senior.
515	
516	DON
517	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Why tough senior? why tough senior?
518	
519	MOTH	Why tender juvenal? why tender juvenal?
520	
521	DON
522	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I spoke it, tender juvenal, as a congruent epitheton
523	appertaining to thy young days, which we may
524	nominate tender.
525	
526	MOTH	And I, tough senior, as an appertinent title to your
527	old time, which we may name tough.
528	
529	DON ADRIANO DE
530	ARMADO	Pretty and apt.
531	
532	MOTH	How mean you, sir? I pretty, and my saying apt? or
533	I apt, and my saying pretty?
534	
535	DON
536	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Thou pretty, because little.
537	
538	MOTH	Little pretty, because little. Wherefore apt?
539	
540	DON
541	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	And therefore apt, because quick.
542	
543	MOTH	Speak you this in my praise, master?
544	
545	DON
546	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	In thy condign praise.
547	
548	MOTH	I will praise an eel with the same praise.
549	
550	DON
551	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What, that an eel is ingenious?
552	
553	MOTH	That an eel is quick.
554	
555	DON
556	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do say thou art quick in answers: thou heatest my blood.
557	
558	MOTH	I am answered, sir.
559	
560	DON
561	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I love not to be crossed.
562	
563	MOTH	[Aside]  He speaks the mere contrary; crosses love not him.
564	
565	DON
566	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I have promised to study three years with the duke.
567	
568	MOTH	You may do it in an hour, sir.
569	
570	DON
571	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Impossible.
572	
573	MOTH	How many is one thrice told?
574	
575	DON
576	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I am ill at reckoning; it fitteth the spirit of a tapster.
577	
578	MOTH	You are a gentleman and a gamester, sir.
579	
580	DON
581	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I confess both: they are both the varnish of a
582	complete man.
583	
584	MOTH	Then, I am sure, you know how much the gross sum of
585	deuce-ace amounts to.
586	
587	DON
588	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	It doth amount to one more than two.
589	
590	MOTH	Which the base vulgar do call three.
591	
592	DON
593	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	True.
594	
595	MOTH	Why, sir, is this such a piece of study? Now here
596	is three studied, ere ye'll thrice wink: and how
597	easy it is to put 'years' to the word 'three,' and
598	study three years in two words, the dancing horse
599	will tell you.
600	
601	DON
602	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	A most fine figure!
603	
604	MOTH	To prove you a cipher.
605	
606	DON
607	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will hereupon confess I am in love: and as it is
608	base for a soldier to love, so am I in love with a
609	base wench. If drawing my sword against the humour
610	of affection would deliver me from the reprobate
611	thought of it, I would take Desire prisoner, and
612	ransom him to any French courtier for a new-devised
613	courtesy. I think scorn to sigh: methinks I should
614	outswear Cupid. Comfort, me, boy: what great men
615	have been in love?
616	
617	MOTH	Hercules, master.
618	
619	DON
620	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Most sweet Hercules! More authority, dear boy, name
621	more; and, sweet my child, let them be men of good
622	repute and carriage.
623	
624	MOTH	Samson, master: he was a man of good carriage, great
625	carriage, for he carried the town-gates on his back
626	like a porter: and he was in love.
627	
628	DON
629	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	O well-knit Samson! strong-jointed Samson! I do
630	excel thee in my rapier as much as thou didst me in
631	carrying gates. I am in love too. Who was Samson's
632	love, my dear Moth?
633	
634	MOTH	A woman, master.
635	
636	DON
637	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Of what complexion?
638	
639	MOTH	Of all the four, or the three, or the two, or one of the four.
640	
641	DON
642	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Tell me precisely of what complexion.
643	
644	MOTH	Of the sea-water green, sir.
645	
646	DON
647	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Is that one of the four complexions?
648	
649	MOTH	As I have read, sir; and the best of them too.
650	
651	DON
652	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Green indeed is the colour of lovers; but to have a
653	love of that colour, methinks Samson had small reason
654	for it. He surely affected her for her wit.
655	
656	MOTH	It was so, sir; for she had a green wit.
657	DON
658	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	My love is most immaculate white and red.
659	
660	MOTH	Most maculate thoughts, master, are masked under
661	such colours.
662	
663	DON
664	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Define, define, well-educated infant.
665	
666	MOTH	My father's wit and my mother's tongue, assist me!
667	
668	DON
669	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet invocation of a child; most pretty and
670	pathetical!
671	
672	MOTH	     If she be made of white and red,
673	Her faults will ne'er be known,
674	For blushing cheeks by faults are bred
675	And fears by pale white shown:
676	Then if she fear, or be to blame,
677	By this you shall not know,
678	For still her cheeks possess the same
679	Which native she doth owe.
680	A dangerous rhyme, master, against the reason of
681	white and red.
682	
683	DON
684	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Is there not a ballad, boy, of the King and the Beggar?
685	
686	MOTH	The world was very guilty of such a ballad some
687	three ages since: but I think now 'tis not to be
688	found; or, if it were, it would neither serve for
689	the writing nor the tune.
690	
691	DON
692	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will have that subject newly writ o'er, that I may
693	example my digression by some mighty precedent.
694	Boy, I do love that country girl that I took in the
695	park with the rational hind Costard: she deserves well.
696	
697	MOTH	[Aside]  To be whipped; and yet a better love than
698	my master.
699	
700	DON
701	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sing, boy; my spirit grows heavy in love.
702	
703	MOTH	And that's great marvel, loving a light wench.
704	
705	DON
706	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I say, sing.
707	
708	MOTH	Forbear till this company be past.
709	
710	[Enter DULL, COSTARD, and JAQUENETTA]
711	
712	DULL	Sir, the duke's pleasure is, that you keep Costard
713	safe: and you must suffer him to take no delight
714	nor no penance; but a' must fast three days a week.
715	For this damsel, I must keep her at the park: she
716	is allowed for the day-woman. Fare you well.
717	
718	DON
719	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do betray myself with blushing. Maid!
720	
721	JAQUENETTA	Man?
722	
723	DON
724	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will visit thee at the lodge.
725	
726	JAQUENETTA	That's hereby.
727	
728	DON
729	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I know where it is situate.
730	
731	JAQUENETTA	Lord, how wise you are!
732	
733	DON
734	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will tell thee wonders.
735	
736	JAQUENETTA	With that face?
737	
738	DON
739	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I love thee.
740	
741	JAQUENETTA	So I heard you say.
742	
743	DON
744	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	And so, farewell.
745	
746	JAQUENETTA	Fair weather after you!
747	
748	DULL	Come, Jaquenetta, away!
749	
750	[Exeunt DULL and JAQUENETTA]
751	
752	DON
753	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Villain, thou shalt fast for thy offences ere thou
754	be pardoned.
755	
756	COSTARD	Well, sir, I hope, when I do it, I shall do it on a
757	full stomach.
758	
759	DON
760	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Thou shalt be heavily punished.
761	
762	COSTARD	I am more bound to you than your fellows, for they
763	are but lightly rewarded.
764	
765	DON
766	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Take away this villain; shut him up.
767	
768	MOTH	Come, you transgressing slave; away!
769	
770	COSTARD	Let me not be pent up, sir: I will fast, being loose.
771	
772	MOTH	No, sir; that were fast and loose: thou shalt to prison.
773	
774	COSTARD	Well, if ever I do see the merry days of desolation
775	that I have seen, some shall see.
776	
777	MOTH	What shall some see?
778	
779	COSTARD	Nay, nothing, Master Moth, but what they look upon.
780	It is not for prisoners to be too silent in their
781	words; and therefore I will say nothing: I thank
782	God I have as little patience as another man; and
783	therefore I can be quiet.
784	
785	[Exeunt MOTH and COSTARD]
786	
787	DON
788	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do affect the very ground, which is base, where
789	her shoe, which is baser, guided by her foot, which
790	is basest, doth tread. I shall be forsworn, which
791	is a great argument of falsehood, if I love. And
792	how can that be true love which is falsely
793	attempted? Love is a familiar; Love is a devil:
794	there is no evil angel but Love. Yet was Samson so
795	tempted, and he had an excellent strength; yet was
796	Solomon so seduced, and he had a very good wit.
797	Cupid's butt-shaft is too hard for Hercules' club;
798	and therefore too much odds for a Spaniard's rapier.
799	The first and second cause will not serve my turn;
800	the passado he respects not, the duello he regards
801	not: his disgrace is to be called boy; but his
802	glory is to subdue men. Adieu, valour! rust rapier!
803	be still, drum! for your manager is in love; yea,
804	he loveth. Assist me, some extemporal god of rhyme,
805	for I am sure I shall turn sonnet. Devise, wit;
806	write, pen; for I am for whole volumes in folio.
807

816	ACT II
817	
818	
819	
820	SCENE I	The same.
821	
822	
823	[Enter the PRINCESS of France, ROSALINE, MARIA,
824	KATHARINE, BOYET, Lords, and other Attendants]
825	
826	BOYET	Now, madam, summon up your dearest spirits:
827	Consider who the king your father sends,
828	To whom he sends, and what's his embassy:
829	Yourself, held precious in the world's esteem,
830	To parley with the sole inheritor
831	Of all perfections that a man may owe,
832	Matchless Navarre; the plea of no less weight
833	Than Aquitaine, a dowry for a queen.
834	Be now as prodigal of all dear grace
835	As Nature was in making graces dear
836	When she did starve the general world beside
837	And prodigally gave them all to you.
838	
839	PRINCESS	Good Lord Boyet, my beauty, though but mean,
840	Needs not the painted flourish of your praise:
841	Beauty is bought by judgement of the eye,
842	Not utter'd by base sale of chapmen's tongues:
843	I am less proud to hear you tell my worth
844	Than you much willing to be counted wise
845	In spending your wit in the praise of mine.
846	But now to task the tasker: good Boyet,
847	You are not ignorant, all-telling fame
848	Doth noise abroad, Navarre hath made a vow,
849	Till painful study shall outwear three years,
850	No woman may approach his silent court:
851	Therefore to's seemeth it a needful course,
852	Before we enter his forbidden gates,
853	To know his pleasure; and in that behalf,
854	Bold of your worthiness, we single you
855	As our best-moving fair solicitor.
856	Tell him, the daughter of the King of France,
857	On serious business, craving quick dispatch,
858	Importunes personal conference with his grace:
859	Haste, signify so much; while we attend,
860	Like humble-visaged suitors, his high will.
861	
862	BOYET	Proud of employment, willingly I go.
863	
864	PRINCESS	All pride is willing pride, and yours is so.
865	
866	[Exit BOYET]
867	
868	Who are the votaries, my loving lords,
869	That are vow-fellows with this virtuous duke?
870	
871	First Lord	Lord Longaville is one.
872	
873	PRINCESS	Know you the man?
874	
875	MARIA	I know him, madam: at a marriage-feast,
876	Between Lord Perigort and the beauteous heir
877	Of Jaques Falconbridge, solemnized
878	In Normandy, saw I this Longaville:
879	A man of sovereign parts he is esteem'd;
880	Well fitted in arts, glorious in arms:
881	Nothing becomes him ill that he would well.
882	The only soil of his fair virtue's gloss,
883	If virtue's gloss will stain with any soil,
884	Is a sharp wit matched with too blunt a will;
885	Whose edge hath power to cut, whose will still wills
886	It should none spare that come within his power.
887	
888	PRINCESS	Some merry mocking lord, belike; is't so?
889	
890	MARIA	They say so most that most his humours know.
891	
892	PRINCESS	Such short-lived wits do wither as they grow.
893	Who are the rest?
894	
895	KATHARINE	The young Dumain, a well-accomplished youth,
896	Of all that virtue love for virtue loved:
897	Most power to do most harm, least knowing ill;
898	For he hath wit to make an ill shape good,
899	And shape to win grace though he had no wit.
900	I saw him at the Duke Alencon's once;
901	And much too little of that good I saw
902	Is my report to his great worthiness.
903	
904	ROSALINE	Another of these students at that time
905	Was there with him, if I have heard a truth.
906	Biron they call him; but a merrier man,
907	Within the limit of becoming mirth,
908	I never spent an hour's talk withal:
909	His eye begets occasion for his wit;
910	For every object that the one doth catch
911	The other turns to a mirth-moving jest,
912	Which his fair tongue, conceit's expositor,
913	Delivers in such apt and gracious words
914	That aged ears play truant at his tales
915	And younger hearings are quite ravished;
916	So sweet and voluble is his discourse.
917	
918	PRINCESS	God bless my ladies! are they all in love,
919	That every one her own hath garnished
920	With such bedecking ornaments of praise?
921	
922	First Lord	Here comes Boyet.
923	
924	[Re-enter BOYET]
925	
926	PRINCESS	Now, what admittance, lord?
927	
928	BOYET	Navarre had notice of your fair approach;
929	And he and his competitors in oath
930	Were all address'd to meet you, gentle lady,
931	Before I came. Marry, thus much I have learnt:
932	He rather means to lodge you in the field,
933	Like one that comes here to besiege his court,
934	Than seek a dispensation for his oath,
935	To let you enter his unpeopled house.
936	Here comes Navarre.
937	
938	[Enter FERDINAND, LONGAVILLE, DUMAIN, BIRON, and
939	Attendants]
940	
941	FERDINAND	Fair princess, welcome to the court of Navarre.
942	
943	PRINCESS	'Fair' I give you back again; and 'welcome' I have
944	not yet: the roof of this court is too high to be
945	yours; and welcome to the wide fields too base to be mine.
946	
947	FERDINAND	You shall be welcome, madam, to my court.
948	
949	PRINCESS	I will be welcome, then: conduct me thither.
950	
951	FERDINAND	Hear me, dear lady; I have sworn an oath.
952	
953	PRINCESS	Our Lady help my lord! he'll be forsworn.
954	
955	FERDINAND	Not for the world, fair madam, by my will.
956	
957	PRINCESS	Why, will shall break it; will and nothing else.
958	
959	FERDINAND	Your ladyship is ignorant what it is.
960	
961	PRINCESS	Were my lord so, his ignorance were wise,
962	Where now his knowledge must prove ignorance.
963	I hear your grace hath sworn out house-keeping:
964	Tis deadly sin to keep that oath, my lord,
965	And sin to break it.
966	But pardon me. I am too sudden-bold:
967	To teach a teacher ill beseemeth me.
968	Vouchsafe to read the purpose of my coming,
969	And suddenly resolve me in my suit.
970	
971	FERDINAND	Madam, I will, if suddenly I may.
972	
973	PRINCESS	You will the sooner, that I were away;
974	For you'll prove perjured if you make me stay.
975	
976	BIRON	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
977	
978	ROSALINE	Did not I dance with you in Brabant once?
979	
980	BIRON	I know you did.
981	
982	ROSALINE	How needless was it then to ask the question!
983	
984	BIRON	You must not be so quick.
985	
986	ROSALINE	'Tis 'long of you that spur me with such questions.
987	
988	BIRON	Your wit's too hot, it speeds too fast, 'twill tire.
989	
990	ROSALINE	Not till it leave the rider in the mire.
991	
992	BIRON	What time o' day?
993	
994	ROSALINE	The hour that fools should ask.
995	
996	BIRON	Now fair befall your mask!
997	
998	ROSALINE	Fair fall the face it covers!
999	
1000	BIRON	And send you many lovers!
1001	
1002	ROSALINE	Amen, so you be none.
1003	
1004	BIRON	Nay, then will I be gone.
1005	
1006	FERDINAND	Madam, your father here doth intimate
1007	The payment of a hundred thousand crowns;
1008	Being but the one half of an entire sum
1009	Disbursed by my father in his wars.
1010	But say that he or we, as neither have,
1011	Received that sum, yet there remains unpaid
1012	A hundred thousand more; in surety of the which,
1013	One part of Aquitaine is bound to us,
1014	Although not valued to the money's worth.
1015	If then the king your father will restore
1016	But that one half which is unsatisfied,
1017	We will give up our right in Aquitaine,
1018	And hold fair friendship with his majesty.
1019	But that, it seems, he little purposeth,
1020	For here he doth demand to have repaid
1021	A hundred thousand crowns; and not demands,
1022	On payment of a hundred thousand crowns,
1023	To have his title live in Aquitaine;
1024	Which we much rather had depart withal
1025	And have the money by our father lent
1026	Than Aquitaine so gelded as it is.
1027	Dear Princess, were not his requests so far
1028	From reason's yielding, your fair self should make
1029	A yielding 'gainst some reason in my breast
1030	And go well satisfied to France again.
1031	
1032	PRINCESS	You do the king my father too much wrong
1033	And wrong the reputation of your name,
1034	In so unseeming to confess receipt
1035	Of that which hath so faithfully been paid.
1036	
1037	FERDINAND	I do protest I never heard of it;
1038	And if you prove it, I'll repay it back
1039	Or yield up Aquitaine.
1040	
1041	PRINCESS	We arrest your word.
1042	Boyet, you can produce acquittances
1043	For such a sum from special officers
1044	Of Charles his father.
1045	
1046	FERDINAND	Satisfy me so.
1047	
1048	BOYET	So please your grace, the packet is not come
1049	Where that and other specialties are bound:
1050	To-morrow you shall have a sight of them.
1051	
1052	FERDINAND	It shall suffice me: at which interview
1053	All liberal reason I will yield unto.
1054	Meantime receive such welcome at my hand
1055	As honour without breach of honour may
1056	Make tender of to thy true worthiness:
1057	You may not come, fair princess, in my gates;
1058	But here without you shall be so received
1059	As you shall deem yourself lodged in my heart,
1060	Though so denied fair harbour in my house.
1061	Your own good thoughts excuse me, and farewell:
1062	To-morrow shall we visit you again.
1063	
1064	PRINCESS	Sweet health and fair desires consort your grace!
1065	
1066	FERDINAND	Thy own wish wish I thee in every place!
1067	
1068	[Exit]
1069	
1070	BIRON	Lady, I will commend you to mine own heart.
1071	
1072	ROSALINE	Pray you, do my commendations; I would be glad to see it.
1073	
1074	BIRON	I would you heard it groan.
1075	
1076	ROSALINE	Is the fool sick?
1077	
1078	BIRON	Sick at the heart.
1079	
1080	ROSALINE	Alack, let it blood.
1081	
1082	BIRON	Would that do it good?
1083	
1084	ROSALINE	My physic says 'ay.'
1085	
1086	BIRON	Will you prick't with your eye?
1087	
1088	ROSALINE	No point, with my knife.
1089	
1090	BIRON	Now, God save thy life!
1091	
1092	ROSALINE	And yours from long living!
1093	
1094	BIRON	I cannot stay thanksgiving.
1095	
1096	[Retiring]
1097	
1098	DUMAIN	Sir, I pray you, a word: what lady is that same?
1099	
1100	BOYET	The heir of Alencon, Katharine her name.
1101	
1102	DUMAIN	A gallant lady. Monsieur, fare you well.
1103	
1104	[Exit]
1105	
1106	LONGAVILLE	I beseech you a word: what is she in the white?
1107	
1108	BOYET	A woman sometimes, an you saw her in the light.
1109	
1110	LONGAVILLE	Perchance light in the light. I desire her name.
1111	
1112	BOYET	She hath but one for herself; to desire that were a shame.
1113	
1114	LONGAVILLE	Pray you, sir, whose daughter?
1115	
1116	BOYET	Her mother's, I have heard.
1117	
1118	LONGAVILLE	God's blessing on your beard!
1119	
1120	BOYET	Good sir, be not offended.
1121	She is an heir of Falconbridge.
1122	
1123	LONGAVILLE	Nay, my choler is ended.
1124	She is a most sweet lady.
1125	
1126	BOYET	Not unlike, sir, that may be.
1127	
1128	[Exit LONGAVILLE]
1129	
1130	BIRON	What's her name in the cap?
1131	
1132	BOYET	Rosaline, by good hap.
1133	
1134	BIRON	Is she wedded or no?
1135	
1136	BOYET	To her will, sir, or so.
1137	
1138	BIRON	You are welcome, sir: adieu.
1139	
1140	BOYET	Farewell to me, sir, and welcome to you.
1141	
1142	[Exit BIRON]
1143	
1144	MARIA	That last is Biron, the merry madcap lord:
1145	Not a word with him but a jest.
1146	
1147	BOYET	And every jest but a word.
1148	
1149	PRINCESS	It was well done of you to take him at his word.
1150	
1151	BOYET	I was as willing to grapple as he was to board.
1152	
1153	MARIA	Two hot sheeps, marry.
1154	
1155	BOYET	And wherefore not ships?
1156	No sheep, sweet lamb, unless we feed on your lips.
1157	
1158	MARIA	You sheep, and I pasture: shall that finish the jest?
1159	
1160	BOYET	So you grant pasture for me.
1161	
1162	[Offering to kiss her]
1163	
1164	MARIA	Not so, gentle beast:
1165	My lips are no common, though several they be.
1166	
1167	BOYET	Belonging to whom?
1168	
1169	MARIA	                  To my fortunes and me.
1170	
1171	PRINCESS	Good wits will be jangling; but, gentles, agree:
1172	This civil war of wits were much better used
1173	On Navarre and his book-men; for here 'tis abused.
1174	
1175	BOYET	If my observation, which very seldom lies,
1176	By the heart's still rhetoric disclosed with eyes,
1177	Deceive me not now, Navarre is infected.
1178	
1179	PRINCESS	With what?
1180	
1181	BOYET	With that which we lovers entitle affected.
1182	
1183	PRINCESS	Your reason?
1184	
1185	BOYET	Why, all his behaviors did make their retire
1186	To the court of his eye, peeping thorough desire:
1187	His heart, like an agate, with your print impress'd,
1188	Proud with his form, in his eye pride express'd:
1189	His tongue, all impatient to speak and not see,
1190	Did stumble with haste in his eyesight to be;
1191	All senses to that sense did make their repair,
1192	To feel only looking on fairest of fair:
1193	Methought all his senses were lock'd in his eye,
1194	As jewels in crystal for some prince to buy;
1195	Who, tendering their own worth from where they were glass'd,
1196	Did point you to buy them, along as you pass'd:
1197	His face's own margent did quote such amazes
1198	That all eyes saw his eyes enchanted with gazes.
1199	I'll give you Aquitaine and all that is his,
1200	An you give him for my sake but one loving kiss.
1201	
1202	PRINCESS	Come to our pavilion: Boyet is disposed.
1203	
1204	BOYET	But to speak that in words which his eye hath
1205	disclosed.
1206	I only have made a mouth of his eye,
1207	By adding a tongue which I know will not lie.
1208	
1209	ROSALINE	Thou art an old love-monger and speakest skilfully.
1210	
1211	MARIA	He is Cupid's grandfather and learns news of him.
1212	
1213	ROSALINE	Then was Venus like her mother, for her father is but grim.
1214	
1215	BOYET	Do you hear, my mad wenches?
1216	
1217	MARIA	No.
1218	
1219	BOYET	What then, do you see?
1220	
1221	ROSALINE	Ay, our way to be gone.
1222	
1223	BOYET	You are too hard for me.
1224	
1225	[Exeunt]

1233	ACT III
1234	
1235	
1236	
1237	SCENE I	The same.
1238	
1239	
1240	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO and MOTH]
1241	
1242	DON
1243	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Warble, child; make passionate my sense of hearing.
1244	
1245	MOTH	Concolinel.
1246	
1247	[Singing]
1248	
1249	DON
1250	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet air! Go, tenderness of years; take this key,
1251	give enlargement to the swain, bring him festinately
1252	hither: I must employ him in a letter to my love.
1253	
1254	MOTH	Master, will you win your love with a French brawl?
1255	
1256	DON
1257	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How meanest thou? brawling in French?
1258	
1259	MOTH	No, my complete master: but to jig off a tune at
1260	the tongue's end, canary to it with your feet, humour
1261	it with turning up your eyelids, sigh a note and
1262	sing a note, sometime through the throat, as if you
1263	swallowed love with singing love, sometime through
1264	the nose, as if you snuffed up love by smelling
1265	love; with your hat penthouse-like o'er the shop of
1266	your eyes; with your arms crossed on your thin-belly
1267	doublet like a rabbit on a spit; or your hands in
1268	your pocket like a man after the old painting; and
1269	keep not too long in one tune, but a snip and away.
1270	These are complements, these are humours; these
1271	betray nice wenches, that would be betrayed without
1272	these; and make them men of note--do you note
1273	me?--that most are affected to these.
1274	
1275	DON
1276	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	How hast thou purchased this experience?
1277	
1278	MOTH	By my penny of observation.
1279	
1280	DON
1281	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	But O,--but O,--
1282	
1283	MOTH	'The hobby-horse is forgot.'
1284	
1285	DON
1286	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Callest thou my love 'hobby-horse'?
1287	
1288	MOTH	No, master; the hobby-horse is but a colt, and your
1289	love perhaps a hackney. But have you forgot your love?
1290	
1291	DON
1292	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Almost I had.
1293	
1294	MOTH	Negligent student! learn her by heart.
1295	
1296	DON
1297	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By heart and in heart, boy.
1298	
1299	MOTH	And out of heart, master: all those three I will prove.
1300	
1301	DON
1302	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What wilt thou prove?
1303	
1304	MOTH	A man, if I live; and this, by, in, and without, upon
1305	the instant: by heart you love her, because your
1306	heart cannot come by her; in heart you love her,
1307	because your heart is in love with her; and out of
1308	heart you love her, being out of heart that you
1309	cannot enjoy her.
1310	
1311	DON
1312	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I am all these three.
1313	
1314	MOTH	And three times as much more, and yet nothing at
1315	all.
1316	
1317	DON
1318	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Fetch hither the swain: he must carry me a letter.
1319	
1320	MOTH	A message well sympathized; a horse to be ambassador
1321	for an ass.
1322	
1323	DON
1324	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Ha, ha! what sayest thou?
1325	
1326	MOTH	Marry, sir, you must send the ass upon the horse,
1327	for he is very slow-gaited. But I go.
1328	
1329	DON
1330	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The way is but short: away!
1331	
1332	MOTH	As swift as lead, sir.
1333	
1334	DON
1335	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The meaning, pretty ingenious?
1336	Is not lead a metal heavy, dull, and slow?
1337	
1338	MOTH	Minime, honest master; or rather, master, no.
1339	
1340	DON
1341	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I say lead is slow.
1342	
1343	MOTH	You are too swift, sir, to say so:
1344	Is that lead slow which is fired from a gun?
1345	
1346	DON
1347	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet smoke of rhetoric!
1348	He reputes me a cannon; and the bullet, that's he:
1349	I shoot thee at the swain.
1350	
1351	MOTH	Thump then and I flee.
1352	
1353	[Exit]
1354	
1355	DON
1356	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	A most acute juvenal; voluble and free of grace!
1357	By thy favour, sweet welkin, I must sigh in thy face:
1358	Most rude melancholy, valour gives thee place.
1359	My herald is return'd.
1360	
1361	[Re-enter MOTH with COSTARD]
1362	
1363	MOTH	A wonder, master! here's a costard broken in a shin.
1364	
1365	DON
1366	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Some enigma, some riddle: come, thy l'envoy; begin.
1367	
1368	COSTARD	No enigma, no riddle, no l'envoy; no salve in the
1369	mail, sir: O, sir, plantain, a plain plantain! no
1370	l'envoy, no l'envoy; no salve, sir, but a plantain!
1371	
1372	DON
1373	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By virtue, thou enforcest laughter; thy silly
1374	thought my spleen; the heaving of my lungs provokes
1375	me to ridiculous smiling. O, pardon me, my stars!
1376	Doth the inconsiderate take salve for l'envoy, and
1377	the word l'envoy for a salve?
1378	
1379	MOTH	Do the wise think them other? is not l'envoy a salve?
1380	
1381	DON
1382	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	No, page: it is an epilogue or discourse, to make plain
1383	Some obscure precedence that hath tofore been sain.
1384	I will example it:
1385	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
1386	Were still at odds, being but three.
1387	There's the moral. Now the l'envoy.
1388	
1389	MOTH	I will add the l'envoy. Say the moral again.
1390	
1391	DON
1392	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	          The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
1393	Were still at odds, being but three.
1394	
1395	MOTH	          Until the goose came out of door,
1396	And stay'd the odds by adding four.
1397	Now will I begin your moral, and do you follow with
1398	my l'envoy.
1399	The fox, the ape, and the humble-bee,
1400	Were still at odds, being but three.
1401	DON
1402	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	          Until the goose came out of door,
1403	Staying the odds by adding four.
1404	
1405	MOTH	A good l'envoy, ending in the goose: would you
1406	desire more?
1407	
1408	COSTARD	The boy hath sold him a bargain, a goose, that's flat.
1409	Sir, your pennyworth is good, an your goose be fat.
1410	To sell a bargain well is as cunning as fast and loose:
1411	Let me see; a fat l'envoy; ay, that's a fat goose.
1412	
1413	DON
1414	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Come hither, come hither. How did this argument begin?
1415	
1416	MOTH	By saying that a costard was broken in a shin.
1417	Then call'd you for the l'envoy.
1418	
1419	COSTARD	True, and I for a plantain: thus came your
1420	argument in;
1421	Then the boy's fat l'envoy, the goose that you bought;
1422	And he ended the market.
1423	
1424	DON
1425	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	But tell me; how was there a costard broken in a shin?
1426	
1427	MOTH	I will tell you sensibly.
1428	
1429	COSTARD	Thou hast no feeling of it, Moth: I will speak that l'envoy:
1430	I Costard, running out, that was safely within,
1431	Fell over the threshold and broke my shin.
1432	
1433	DON
1434	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	We will talk no more of this matter.
1435	
1436	COSTARD	Till there be more matter in the shin.
1437	
1438	DON
1439	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sirrah Costard, I will enfranchise thee.
1440	
1441	COSTARD	O, marry me to one Frances: I smell some l'envoy,
1442	some goose, in this.
1443	
1444	DON
1445	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By my sweet soul, I mean setting thee at liberty,
1446	enfreedoming thy person; thou wert immured,
1447	restrained, captivated, bound.
1448	
1449	COSTARD	True, true; and now you will be my purgation and let me loose.
1450	
1451	DON
1452	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I give thee thy liberty, set thee from durance; and,
1453	in lieu thereof, impose on thee nothing but this:
1454	bear this significant
1455	
1456	[Giving a letter]
1457	
1458	to the country maid Jaquenetta:
1459	there is remuneration; for the best ward of mine
1460	honour is rewarding my dependents. Moth, follow.
1461	
1462	[Exit]
1463	
1464	MOTH	Like the sequel, I. Signior Costard, adieu.
1465	
1466	COSTARD	My sweet ounce of man's flesh! my incony Jew!
1467	
1468	[Exit MOTH]
1469	
1470	Now will I look to his remuneration. Remuneration!
1471	O, that's the Latin word for three farthings: three
1472	farthings--remuneration.--'What's the price of this
1473	inkle?'--'One penny.'--'No, I'll give you a
1474	remuneration:' why, it carries it. Remuneration!
1475	why, it is a fairer name than French crown. I will
1476	never buy and sell out of this word.
1477	
1478	[Enter BIRON]
1479	
1480	BIRON	O, my good knave Costard! exceedingly well met.
1481	
1482	COSTARD	Pray you, sir, how much carnation ribbon may a man
1483	buy for a remuneration?
1484	
1485	BIRON	What is a remuneration?
1486	
1487	COSTARD	Marry, sir, halfpenny farthing.
1488	
1489	BIRON	Why, then, three-farthing worth of silk.
1490	
1491	COSTARD	I thank your worship: God be wi' you!
1492	
1493	BIRON	Stay, slave; I must employ thee:
1494	As thou wilt win my favour, good my knave,
1495	Do one thing for me that I shall entreat.
1496	
1497	COSTARD	When would you have it done, sir?
1498	
1499	BIRON	This afternoon.
1500	
1501	COSTARD	Well, I will do it, sir: fare you well.
1502	
1503	BIRON	Thou knowest not what it is.
1504	
1505	COSTARD	I shall know, sir, when I have done it.
1506	
1507	BIRON	Why, villain, thou must know first.
1508	
1509	COSTARD	I will come to your worship to-morrow morning.
1510	
1511	BIRON	It must be done this afternoon.
1512	Hark, slave, it is but this:
1513	The princess comes to hunt here in the park,
1514	And in her train there is a gentle lady;
1515	When tongues speak sweetly, then they name her name,
1516	And Rosaline they call her: ask for her;
1517	And to her white hand see thou do commend
1518	This seal'd-up counsel. There's thy guerdon; go.
1519	
1520	[Giving him a shilling]
1521	
1522	COSTARD	Gardon, O sweet gardon! better than remuneration,
1523	a'leven-pence farthing better: most sweet gardon! I
1524	will do it sir, in print. Gardon! Remuneration!
1525	
1526	[Exit]
1527	
1528	BIRON	And I, forsooth, in love! I, that have been love's whip;
1529	A very beadle to a humorous sigh;
1530	A critic, nay, a night-watch constable;
1531	A domineering pedant o'er the boy;
1532	Than whom no mortal so magnificent!
1533	This whimpled, whining, purblind, wayward boy;
1534	This senior-junior, giant-dwarf, Dan Cupid;
1535	Regent of love-rhymes, lord of folded arms,
1536	The anointed sovereign of sighs and groans,
1537	Liege of all loiterers and malcontents,
1538	Dread prince of plackets, king of codpieces,
1539	Sole imperator and great general
1540	Of trotting 'paritors:--O my little heart:--
1541	And I to be a corporal of his field,
1542	And wear his colours like a tumbler's hoop!
1543	What, I! I love! I sue! I seek a wife!
1544	A woman, that is like a German clock,
1545	Still a-repairing, ever out of frame,
1546	And never going aright, being a watch,
1547	But being watch'd that it may still go right!
1548	Nay, to be perjured, which is worst of all;
1549	And, among three, to love the worst of all;
1550	A wightly wanton with a velvet brow,
1551	With two pitch-balls stuck in her face for eyes;
1552	Ay, and by heaven, one that will do the deed
1553	Though Argus were her eunuch and her guard:
1554	And I to sigh for her! to watch for her!
1555	To pray for her! Go to; it is a plague
1556	That Cupid will impose for my neglect
1557	Of his almighty dreadful little might.
1558	Well, I will love, write, sigh, pray, sue and groan:
1559	Some men must love my lady and some Joan.
1560	
1561	[Exit]

1566	LOVE'S LABOURS LOST
1567	
1568	
1569	ACT IV
1570	
1571	
1572	
1573	SCENE I	The same.
1574	
1575	
1576	[Enter the PRINCESS, and her train, a Forester,
1577	BOYET, ROSALINE, MARIA, and KATHARINE]
1578	
1579	PRINCESS	Was that the king, that spurred his horse so hard
1580	Against the steep uprising of the hill?
1581	
1582	BOYET	I know not; but I think it was not he.
1583	
1584	PRINCESS	Whoe'er a' was, a' show'd a mounting mind.
1585	Well, lords, to-day we shall have our dispatch:
1586	On Saturday we will return to France.
1587	Then, forester, my friend, where is the bush
1588	That we must stand and play the murderer in?
1589	
1590	Forester	Hereby, upon the edge of yonder coppice;
1591	A stand where you may make the fairest shoot.
1592	
1593	PRINCESS	I thank my beauty, I am fair that shoot,
1594	And thereupon thou speak'st the fairest shoot.
1595	
1596	Forester	Pardon me, madam, for I meant not so.
1597	
1598	PRINCESS	What, what? first praise me and again say no?
1599	O short-lived pride! Not fair? alack for woe!
1600	
1601	Forester	Yes, madam, fair.
1602	
1603	PRINCESS	                  Nay, never paint me now:
1604	Where fair is not, praise cannot mend the brow.
1605	Here, good my glass, take this for telling true:
1606	Fair payment for foul words is more than due.
1607	
1608	Forester	Nothing but fair is that which you inherit.
1609	
1610	PRINCESS	See see, my beauty will be saved by merit!
1611	O heresy in fair, fit for these days!
1612	A giving hand, though foul, shall have fair praise.
1613	But come, the bow: now mercy goes to kill,
1614	And shooting well is then accounted ill.
1615	Thus will I save my credit in the shoot:
1616	Not wounding, pity would not let me do't;
1617	If wounding, then it was to show my skill,
1618	That more for praise than purpose meant to kill.
1619	And out of question so it is sometimes,
1620	Glory grows guilty of detested crimes,
1621	When, for fame's sake, for praise, an outward part,
1622	We bend to that the working of the heart;
1623	As I for praise alone now seek to spill
1624	The poor deer's blood, that my heart means no ill.
1625	
1626	BOYET	Do not curst wives hold that self-sovereignty
1627	Only for praise sake, when they strive to be
1628	Lords o'er their lords?
1629	
1630	PRINCESS	Only for praise: and praise we may afford
1631	To any lady that subdues a lord.
1632	
1633	BOYET	Here comes a member of the commonwealth.
1634	
1635	[Enter COSTARD]
1636	
1637	COSTARD	God dig-you-den all! Pray you, which is the head lady?
1638	
1639	PRINCESS	Thou shalt know her, fellow, by the rest that have no heads.
1640	
1641	COSTARD	Which is the greatest lady, the highest?
1642	
1643	PRINCESS	The thickest and the tallest.
1644	
1645	COSTARD	The thickest and the tallest! it is so; truth is truth.
1646	An your waist, mistress, were as slender as my wit,
1647	One o' these maids' girdles for your waist should be fit.
1648	Are not you the chief woman? you are the thickest here.
1649	
1650	PRINCESS	What's your will, sir? what's your will?
1651	
1652	COSTARD	I have a letter from Monsieur Biron to one Lady Rosaline.
1653	
1654	PRINCESS	O, thy letter, thy letter! he's a good friend of mine:
1655	Stand aside, good bearer. Boyet, you can carve;
1656	Break up this capon.
1657	
1658	BOYET	I am bound to serve.
1659	This letter is mistook, it importeth none here;
1660	It is writ to Jaquenetta.
1661	
1662	PRINCESS	We will read it, I swear.
1663	Break the neck of the wax, and every one give ear.
1664

1666	
1667	BOYET	'By heaven, that thou art fair, is most infallible;
1668	true, that thou art beauteous; truth itself, that
1669	thou art lovely. More fairer than fair, beautiful
1670	than beauteous, truer than truth itself, have
1671	commiseration on thy heroical vassal! The
1672	magnanimous and most illustrate king Cophetua set
1673	eye upon the pernicious and indubitate beggar
1674	Zenelophon; and he it was that might rightly say,
1675	Veni, vidi, vici; which to annothanize in the
1676	vulgar,--O base and obscure vulgar!--videlicet, He
1677	came, saw, and overcame: he came, one; saw two;
1678	overcame, three. Who came? the king: why did he
1679	come? to see: why did he see? to overcome: to
1680	whom came he? to the beggar: what saw he? the
1681	beggar: who overcame he? the beggar. The
1682	conclusion is victory: on whose side? the king's.
1683	The captive is enriched: on whose side? the
1684	beggar's. The catastrophe is a nuptial: on whose
1685	side? the king's: no, on both in one, or one in
1686	both. I am the king; for so stands the comparison:
1687	thou the beggar; for so witnesseth thy lowliness.
1688	Shall I command thy love? I may: shall I enforce
1689	thy love? I could: shall I entreat thy love? I
1690	will. What shalt thou exchange for rags? robes;
1691	for tittles? titles; for thyself? me. Thus,
1692	expecting thy reply, I profane my lips on thy foot,
1693	my eyes on thy picture. and my heart on thy every
1694	part. Thine, in the dearest design of industry,
1695	DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO.'
1696	
1697	Thus dost thou hear the Nemean lion roar
1698	'Gainst thee, thou lamb, that standest as his prey.
1699	Submissive fall his princely feet before,
1700	And he from forage will incline to play:
1701	But if thou strive, poor soul, what art thou then?
1702	Food for his rage, repasture for his den.
1703	
1704	PRINCESS	What plume of feathers is he that indited this letter?
1705	What vane? what weathercock? did you ever hear better?
1706	
1707	BOYET	I am much deceived but I remember the style.
1708	
1709	PRINCESS	Else your memory is bad, going o'er it erewhile.
1710	
1711	BOYET	This Armado is a Spaniard, that keeps here in court;
1712	A phantasime, a Monarcho, and one that makes sport
1713	To the prince and his bookmates.
1714	
1715	PRINCESS	Thou fellow, a word:
1716	Who gave thee this letter?
1717	
1718	COSTARD	I told you; my lord.
1719	
1720	PRINCESS	To whom shouldst thou give it?
1721	
1722	COSTARD	From my lord to my lady.
1723	
1724	PRINCESS	From which lord to which lady?
1725	
1726	COSTARD	From my lord Biron, a good master of mine,
1727	To a lady of France that he call'd Rosaline.
1728	
1729	PRINCESS	Thou hast mistaken his letter. Come, lords, away.
1730	
1731	[To ROSALINE]
1732	
1733	Here, sweet, put up this: 'twill be thine another day.
1734	
1735	[Exeunt PRINCESS and train]
1736	
1737	BOYET	Who is the suitor? who is the suitor?
1738	
1739	ROSALINE	Shall I teach you to know?
1740	
1741	BOYET	Ay, my continent of beauty.
1742	
1743	ROSALINE	Why, she that bears the bow.
1744	Finely put off!
1745	
1746	BOYET	My lady goes to kill horns; but, if thou marry,
1747	Hang me by the neck, if horns that year miscarry.
1748	Finely put on!
1749	
1750	ROSALINE	Well, then, I am the shooter.
1751	
1752	BOYET	And who is your deer?
1753	
1754	ROSALINE	If we choose by the horns, yourself come not near.
1755	Finely put on, indeed!
1756	
1757	MARIA	You still wrangle with her, Boyet, and she strikes
1758	at the brow.
1759	
1760	BOYET	But she herself is hit lower: have I hit her now?
1761	
1762	ROSALINE	Shall I come upon thee with an old saying, that was
1763	a man when King Pepin of France was a little boy, as
1764	touching the hit it?
1765	
1766	BOYET	So I may answer thee with one as old, that was a
1767	woman when Queen Guinover of Britain was a little
1768	wench, as touching the hit it.
1769	
1770	ROSALINE	          Thou canst not hit it, hit it, hit it,
1771	Thou canst not hit it, my good man.
1772	
1773	BOYET	          An I cannot, cannot, cannot,
1774	An I cannot, another can.
1775	
1776	[Exeunt ROSALINE and KATHARINE]
1777	
1778	COSTARD	By my troth, most pleasant: how both did fit it!
1779	
1780	MARIA	A mark marvellous well shot, for they both did hit it.
1781	
1782	BOYET	A mark! O, mark but that mark! A mark, says my lady!
1783	Let the mark have a prick in't, to mete at, if it may be.
1784	
1785	MARIA	Wide o' the bow hand! i' faith, your hand is out.
1786	
1787	COSTARD	Indeed, a' must shoot nearer, or he'll ne'er hit the clout.
1788	
1789	BOYET	An if my hand be out, then belike your hand is in.
1790	
1791	COSTARD	Then will she get the upshoot by cleaving the pin.
1792	
1793	MARIA	Come, come, you talk greasily; your lips grow foul.
1794	
1795	COSTARD	She's too hard for you at pricks, sir: challenge her to bowl.
1796	
1797	BOYET	I fear too much rubbing. Good night, my good owl.
1798	
1799	[Exeunt BOYET and MARIA]
1800	
1801	COSTARD	By my soul, a swain! a most simple clown!
1802	Lord, Lord, how the ladies and I have put him down!
1803	O' my troth, most sweet jests! most incony
1804	vulgar wit!
1805	When it comes so smoothly off, so obscenely, as it
1806	were, so fit.
1807	Armado o' th' one side,--O, a most dainty man!
1808	To see him walk before a lady and to bear her fan!
1809	To see him kiss his hand! and how most sweetly a'
1810	will swear!
1811	And his page o' t' other side, that handful of wit!
1812	Ah, heavens, it is a most pathetical nit!
1813	Sola, sola!

1829	SCENE II	The same.
1830	
1831	
1832	[Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL]
1833	
1834	SIR NATHANIEL	Very reverend sport, truly; and done in the testimony
1835	of a good conscience.
1836	
1837	HOLOFERNES	The deer was, as you know, sanguis, in blood; ripe
1838	as the pomewater, who now hangeth like a jewel in
1839	the ear of caelo, the sky, the welkin, the heaven;
1840	and anon falleth like a crab on the face of terra,
1841	the soil, the land, the earth.
1842	
1843	SIR NATHANIEL	Truly, Master Holofernes, the epithets are sweetly
1844	varied, like a scholar at the least: but, sir, I
1845	assure ye, it was a buck of the first head.
1846	
1847	HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, haud credo.
1848	
1849	DULL	'Twas not a haud credo; 'twas a pricket.
1850	
1851	HOLOFERNES	Most barbarous intimation! yet a kind of
1852	insinuation, as it were, in via, in way, of
1853	explication; facere, as it were, replication, or
1854	rather, ostentare, to show, as it were, his
1855	inclination, after his undressed, unpolished,
1856	uneducated, unpruned, untrained, or rather,
1857	unlettered, or ratherest, unconfirmed fashion, to
1858	insert again my haud credo for a deer.
1859	
1860	DULL	I said the deer was not a haud credo; twas a pricket.
1861	
1862	HOLOFERNES	Twice-sod simplicity, his coctus!
1863	O thou monster Ignorance, how deformed dost thou look!
1864	
1865	SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, he hath never fed of the dainties that are bred
1866	in a book; he hath not eat paper, as it were; he
1867	hath not drunk ink: his intellect is not
1868	replenished; he is only an animal, only sensible in
1869	the duller parts:
1870	And such barren plants are set before us, that we
1871	thankful should be,
1872	Which we of taste and feeling are, for those parts that
1873	do fructify in us more than he.
1874	For as it would ill become me to be vain, indiscreet, or a fool,
1875	So were there a patch set on learning, to see him in a school:
1876	But omne bene, say I; being of an old father's mind,
1877	Many can brook the weather that love not the wind.
1878	
1879	DULL	You two are book-men: can you tell me by your wit
1880	What was a month old at Cain's birth, that's not five
1881	weeks old as yet?
1882	
1883	HOLOFERNES	Dictynna, goodman Dull; Dictynna, goodman Dull.
1884	
1885	DULL	What is Dictynna?
1886	
1887	SIR NATHANIEL	A title to Phoebe, to Luna, to the moon.
1888	
1889	HOLOFERNES	The moon was a month old when Adam was no more,
1890	And raught not to five weeks when he came to
1891	five-score.
1892	The allusion holds in the exchange.
1893	
1894	DULL	'Tis true indeed; the collusion holds in the exchange.
1895	
1896	HOLOFERNES	God comfort thy capacity! I say, the allusion holds
1897	in the exchange.
1898	
1899	DULL	And I say, the pollusion holds in the exchange; for
1900	the moon is never but a month old: and I say beside
1901	that, 'twas a pricket that the princess killed.
1902	
1903	HOLOFERNES	Sir Nathaniel, will you hear an extemporal epitaph
1904	on the death of the deer? And, to humour the
1905	ignorant, call I the deer the princess killed a pricket.
1906	
1907	SIR NATHANIEL	Perge, good Master Holofernes, perge; so it shall
1908	please you to abrogate scurrility.
1909	
1910	HOLOFERNES	I will something affect the letter, for it argues facility.
1911	The preyful princess pierced and prick'd a pretty
1912	pleasing pricket;
1913	Some say a sore; but not a sore, till now made
1914	sore with shooting.
1915	The dogs did yell: put L to sore, then sorel jumps
1916	from thicket;
1917	Or pricket sore, or else sorel; the people fall a-hooting.
1918	If sore be sore, then L to sore makes fifty sores
1919	one sorel.
1920	Of one sore I an hundred make by adding but one more L.
1921	
1922	SIR NATHANIEL	A rare talent!
1923	
1924	DULL	[Aside]  If a talent be a claw, look how he claws
1925	him with a talent.
1926	
1927	HOLOFERNES	This is a gift that I have, simple, simple; a
1928	foolish extravagant spirit, full of forms, figures,
1929	shapes, objects, ideas, apprehensions, motions,
1930	revolutions: these are begot in the ventricle of
1931	memory, nourished in the womb of pia mater, and
1932	delivered upon the mellowing of occasion. But the
1933	gift is good in those in whom it is acute, and I am
1934	thankful for it.
1935	
1936	SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, I praise the Lord for you; and so may my
1937	parishioners; for their sons are well tutored by
1938	you, and their daughters profit very greatly under
1939	you: you are a good member of the commonwealth.
1940	
1941	HOLOFERNES	Mehercle, if their sons be ingenuous, they shall
1942	want no instruction; if their daughters be capable,
1943	I will put it to them: but vir sapit qui pauca
1944	loquitur; a soul feminine saluteth us.
1945	
1946	[Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD]
1947	
1948	JAQUENETTA	God give you good morrow, master Parson.
1949	
1950	HOLOFERNES	Master Parson, quasi pers-on. An if one should be
1951	pierced, which is the one?
1952	
1953	COSTARD	Marry, master schoolmaster, he that is likest to a hogshead.
1954	
1955	HOLOFERNES	Piercing a hogshead! a good lustre of conceit in a
1956	tuft of earth; fire enough for a flint, pearl enough
1957	for a swine: 'tis pretty; it is well.
1958	
1959	JAQUENETTA	Good master Parson, be so good as read me this
1960	letter: it was given me by Costard, and sent me
1961	from Don Armado: I beseech you, read it.
1962	
1963	HOLOFERNES	Fauste, precor gelida quando pecus omne sub umbra
1964	Ruminat,--and so forth. Ah, good old Mantuan! I
1965	may speak of thee as the traveller doth of Venice;
1966	Venetia, Venetia,
1967	Chi non ti vede non ti pretia.
1968	Old Mantuan, old Mantuan! who understandeth thee
1969	not, loves thee not. Ut, re, sol, la, mi, fa.
1970	Under pardon, sir, what are the contents? or rather,
1971	as Horace says in his--What, my soul, verses?
1972	
1973	SIR NATHANIEL	Ay, sir, and very learned.
1974	
1975	HOLOFERNES	Let me hear a staff, a stanze, a verse; lege, domine.
1976	
1977	SIR NATHANIEL	[Reads]
1978	
1979	If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
1980	Ah, never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd!
1981	Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll faithful prove:
1982	Those thoughts to me were oaks, to thee like
1983	osiers bow'd.
1984	Study his bias leaves and makes his book thine eyes,
1985	Where all those pleasures live that art would
1986	comprehend:
1987	If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
1988	Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend,
1989	All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
1990	Which is to me some praise that I thy parts admire:
1991	Thy eye Jove's lightning bears, thy voice his dreadful thunder,
1992	Which not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
1993	Celestial as thou art, O, pardon, love, this wrong,
1994	That sings heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
1995	
1996	HOLOFERNES	You find not the apostraphas, and so miss the
1997	accent: let me supervise the canzonet. Here are
1998	only numbers ratified; but, for the elegancy,
1999	facility, and golden cadence of poesy, caret.
2000	Ovidius Naso was the man: and why, indeed, Naso,
2001	but for smelling out the odouriferous flowers of
2002	fancy, the jerks of invention? Imitari is nothing:
2003	so doth the hound his master, the ape his keeper,
2004	the tired horse his rider. But, damosella virgin,
2005	was this directed to you?
2006	
2007	JAQUENETTA	Ay, sir, from one Monsieur Biron, one of the strange
2008	queen's lords.
2009	
2010	HOLOFERNES	I will overglance the superscript: 'To the
2011	snow-white hand of the most beauteous Lady
2012	Rosaline.' I will look again on the intellect of
2013	the letter, for the nomination of the party writing
2014	to the person written unto: 'Your ladyship's in all
2015	desired employment, BIRON.' Sir Nathaniel, this
2016	Biron is one of the votaries with the king; and here
2017	he hath framed a letter to a sequent of the stranger
2018	queen's, which accidentally, or by the way of
2019	progression, hath miscarried. Trip and go, my
2020	sweet; deliver this paper into the royal hand of the
2021	king: it may concern much. Stay not thy
2022	compliment; I forgive thy duty; adieu.
2023	
2024	JAQUENETTA	Good Costard, go with me. Sir, God save your life!
2025	
2026	COSTARD	Have with thee, my girl.
2027	
2028	[Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA]
2029	
2030	SIR NATHANIEL	Sir, you have done this in the fear of God, very
2031	religiously; and, as a certain father saith,--
2032	
2033	HOLOFERNES	Sir tell me not of the father; I do fear colourable
2034	colours. But to return to the verses: did they
2035	please you, Sir Nathaniel?
2036	
2037	SIR NATHANIEL	Marvellous well for the pen.
2038	
2039	HOLOFERNES	I do dine to-day at the father's of a certain pupil
2040	of mine; where, if, before repast, it shall please
2041	you to gratify the table with a grace, I will, on my
2042	privilege I have with the parents of the foresaid
2043	child or pupil, undertake your ben venuto; where I
2044	will prove those verses to be very unlearned,
2045	neither savouring of poetry, wit, nor invention: I
2046	beseech your society.
2047	
2048	SIR NATHANIEL	And thank you too; for society, saith the text, is
2049	the happiness of life.
2050	
2051	HOLOFERNES	And, certes, the text most infallibly concludes it.
2052	
2053	[To DULL]
2054	
2055	Sir, I do invite you too; you shall not
2056	say me nay: pauca verba. Away! the gentles are at
2057	their game, and we will to our recreation.

2074	[Enter BIRON, with a paper]
2075	
2076	BIRON	The king he is hunting the deer; I am coursing
2077	myself: they have pitched a toil; I am toiling in
2078	a pitch,--pitch that defiles: defile! a foul
2079	word. Well, set thee down, sorrow! for so they say
2080	the fool said, and so say I, and I the fool: well
2081	proved, wit! By the Lord, this love is as mad as
2082	Ajax: it kills sheep; it kills me, I a sheep:
2083	well proved again o' my side! I will not love: if
2084	I do, hang me; i' faith, I will not. O, but her
2085	eye,--by this light, but for her eye, I would not
2086	love her; yes, for her two eyes. Well, I do nothing
2087	in the world but lie, and lie in my throat. By
2088	heaven, I do love: and it hath taught me to rhyme
2089	and to be melancholy; and here is part of my rhyme,
2090	and here my melancholy. Well, she hath one o' my
2091	sonnets already: the clown bore it, the fool sent
2092	it, and the lady hath it: sweet clown, sweeter
2093	fool, sweetest lady! By the world, I would not care
2094	a pin, if the other three were in. Here comes one
2095	with a paper: God give him grace to groan!
2096	
2097	[Stands aside]
2098	
2099	[Enter FERDINAND, with a paper]
2100	
2101	FERDINAND	Ay me!
2102	
2103	BIRON	[Aside]  Shot, by heaven! Proceed, sweet Cupid:
2104	thou hast thumped him with thy bird-bolt under the
2105	left pap. In faith, secrets!
2106	
2107	FERDINAND	[Reads]
2108	
2109	So sweet a kiss the golden sun gives not
2110	To those fresh morning drops upon the rose,
2111	As thy eye-beams, when their fresh rays have smote
2112	The night of dew that on my cheeks down flows:
2113	Nor shines the silver moon one half so bright
2114	Through the transparent bosom of the deep,
2115	As doth thy face through tears of mine give light;
2116	Thou shinest in every tear that I do weep:
2117	No drop but as a coach doth carry thee;
2118	So ridest thou triumphing in my woe.
2119	Do but behold the tears that swell in me,
2120	And they thy glory through my grief will show:
2121	But do not love thyself; then thou wilt keep
2122	My tears for glasses, and still make me weep.
2123	O queen of queens! how far dost thou excel,
2124	No thought can think, nor tongue of mortal tell.
2125	How shall she know my griefs? I'll drop the paper:
2126	Sweet leaves, shade folly. Who is he comes here?
2127	
2128	[Steps aside]
2129	
2130	What, Longaville! and reading! listen, ear.
2131	
2132	BIRON	Now, in thy likeness, one more fool appear!
2133	
2134	[Enter LONGAVILLE, with a paper]
2135	
2136	LONGAVILLE	Ay me, I am forsworn!
2137	
2138	BIRON	Why, he comes in like a perjure, wearing papers.
2139	
2140	FERDINAND	In love, I hope: sweet fellowship in shame!
2141	
2142	BIRON	One drunkard loves another of the name.
2143	
2144	LONGAVILLE	Am I the first that have been perjured so?
2145	
2146	BIRON	I could put thee in comfort. Not by two that I know:
2147	Thou makest the triumviry, the corner-cap of society,
2148	The shape of Love's Tyburn that hangs up simplicity.
2149	
2150	LONGAVILLE	I fear these stubborn lines lack power to move:
2151	O sweet Maria, empress of my love!
2152	These numbers will I tear, and write in prose.
2153	
2154	BIRON	O, rhymes are guards on wanton Cupid's hose:
2155	Disfigure not his slop.
2156	
2157	LONGAVILLE	This same shall go.
2158	
2159	[Reads]
2160	
2161	Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
2162	'Gainst whom the world cannot hold argument,
2163	Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
2164	Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
2165	A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
2166	Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
2167	My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
2168	Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
2169	Vows are but breath, and breath a vapour is:
2170	Then thou, fair sun, which on my earth dost shine,
2171	Exhalest this vapour-vow; in thee it is:
2172	If broken then, it is no fault of mine:
2173	If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
2174	To lose an oath to win a paradise?
2175	
2176	BIRON	This is the liver-vein, which makes flesh a deity,
2177	A green goose a goddess: pure, pure idolatry.
2178	God amend us, God amend! we are much out o' the way.
2179	
2180	LONGAVILLE	By whom shall I send this?--Company! stay.
2181	
2182	[Steps aside]
2183	
2184	BIRON	All hid, all hid; an old infant play.
2185	Like a demigod here sit I in the sky.
2186	And wretched fools' secrets heedfully o'ereye.
2187	More sacks to the mill! O heavens, I have my wish!
2188	
2189	[Enter DUMAIN, with a paper]
2190	
2191	Dumain transform'd! four woodcocks in a dish!
2192	
2193	DUMAIN	O most divine Kate!
2194	
2195	BIRON	O most profane coxcomb!
2196	
2197	DUMAIN	By heaven, the wonder in a mortal eye!
2198	
2199	BIRON	By earth, she is not, corporal, there you lie.
2200	
2201	DUMAIN	Her amber hair for foul hath amber quoted.
2202	
2203	BIRON	An amber-colour'd raven was well noted.
2204	
2205	DUMAIN	As upright as the cedar.
2206	
2207	BIRON	Stoop, I say;
2208	Her shoulder is with child.
2209	
2210	DUMAIN	As fair as day.
2211	
2212	BIRON	Ay, as some days; but then no sun must shine.
2213	
2214	DUMAIN	O that I had my wish!
2215	
2216	LONGAVILLE	And I had mine!
2217	
2218	FERDINAND	And I mine too, good Lord!
2219	
2220	BIRON	Amen, so I had mine: is not that a good word?
2221	
2222	DUMAIN	I would forget her; but a fever she
2223	Reigns in my blood and will remember'd be.
2224	
2225	BIRON	A fever in your blood! why, then incision
2226	Would let her out in saucers: sweet misprision!
2227	
2228	DUMAIN	Once more I'll read the ode that I have writ.
2229	
2230	BIRON	Once more I'll mark how love can vary wit.
2231	
2232	DUMAIN	[Reads]
2233	
2234	On a day--alack the day!--
2235	Love, whose month is ever May,
2236	Spied a blossom passing fair
2237	Playing in the wanton air:
2238	Through the velvet leaves the wind,
2239	All unseen, can passage find;
2240	That the lover, sick to death,
2241	Wish himself the heaven's breath.
2242	Air, quoth he, thy cheeks may blow;
2243	Air, would I might triumph so!
2244	But, alack, my hand is sworn
2245	Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn;
2246	Vow, alack, for youth unmeet,
2247	Youth so apt to pluck a sweet!
2248	Do not call it sin in me,
2249	That I am forsworn for thee;
2250	Thou for whom Jove would swear
2251	Juno but an Ethiope were;
2252	And deny himself for Jove,
2253	Turning mortal for thy love.
2254	This will I send, and something else more plain,
2255	That shall express my true love's fasting pain.
2256	O, would the king, Biron, and Longaville,
2257	Were lovers too! Ill, to example ill,
2258	Would from my forehead wipe a perjured note;
2259	For none offend where all alike do dote.
2260	
2261	LONGAVILLE	[Advancing]  Dumain, thy love is far from charity.
2262	You may look pale, but I should blush, I know,
2263	To be o'erheard and taken napping so.
2264	
2265	FERDINAND	[Advancing]  Come, sir, you blush; as his your case is such;
2266	You chide at him, offending twice as much;
2267	You do not love Maria; Longaville
2268	Did never sonnet for her sake compile,
2269	Nor never lay his wreathed arms athwart
2270	His loving bosom to keep down his heart.
2271	I have been closely shrouded in this bush
2272	And mark'd you both and for you both did blush:
2273	I heard your guilty rhymes, observed your fashion,
2274	Saw sighs reek from you, noted well your passion:
2275	Ay me! says one; O Jove! the other cries;
2276	One, her hairs were gold, crystal the other's eyes:
2277	
2278	[To LONGAVILLE]
2279	
2280	You would for paradise break faith, and troth;
2281	
2282	[To DUMAIN]
2283	
2284	And Jove, for your love, would infringe an oath.
2285	What will Biron say when that he shall hear
2286	Faith so infringed, which such zeal did swear?
2287	How will he scorn! how will he spend his wit!
2288	How will he triumph, leap and laugh at it!
2289	For all the wealth that ever I did see,
2290	I would not have him know so much by me.
2291	
2292	BIRON	Now step I forth to whip hypocrisy.
2293	
2294	[Advancing]
2295	
2296	Ah, good my liege, I pray thee, pardon me!
2297	Good heart, what grace hast thou, thus to reprove
2298	These worms for loving, that art most in love?
2299	Your eyes do make no coaches; in your tears
2300	There is no certain princess that appears;
2301	You'll not be perjured, 'tis a hateful thing;
2302	Tush, none but minstrels like of sonneting!
2303	But are you not ashamed? nay, are you not,
2304	All three of you, to be thus much o'ershot?
2305	You found his mote; the king your mote did see;
2306	But I a beam do find in each of three.
2307	O, what a scene of foolery have I seen,
2308	Of sighs, of groans, of sorrow and of teen!
2309	O me, with what strict patience have I sat,
2310	To see a king transformed to a gnat!
2311	To see great Hercules whipping a gig,
2312	And profound Solomon to tune a jig,
2313	And Nestor play at push-pin with the boys,
2314	And critic Timon laugh at idle toys!
2315	Where lies thy grief, O, tell me, good Dumain?
2316	And gentle Longaville, where lies thy pain?
2317	And where my liege's? all about the breast:
2318	A caudle, ho!
2319	
2320	FERDINAND	                  Too bitter is thy jest.
2321	Are we betray'd thus to thy over-view?
2322	
2323	BIRON	Not you to me, but I betray'd by you:
2324	I, that am honest; I, that hold it sin
2325	To break the vow I am engaged in;
2326	I am betray'd, by keeping company
2327	With men like men of inconstancy.
2328	When shall you see me write a thing in rhyme?
2329	Or groan for love? or spend a minute's time
2330	In pruning me? When shall you hear that I
2331	Will praise a hand, a foot, a face, an eye,
2332	A gait, a state, a brow, a breast, a waist,
2333	A leg, a limb?
2334	
2335	FERDINAND	                  Soft! whither away so fast?
2336	A true man or a thief that gallops so?
2337	
2338	BIRON	I post from love: good lover, let me go.
2339	
2340	[Enter JAQUENETTA and COSTARD]
2341	
2342	JAQUENETTA	God bless the king!
2343	
2344	FERDINAND	What present hast thou there?
2345	
2346	COSTARD	Some certain treason.
2347	
2348	FERDINAND	What makes treason here?
2349	
2350	COSTARD	Nay, it makes nothing, sir.
2351	
2352	FERDINAND	If it mar nothing neither,
2353	The treason and you go in peace away together.
2354	
2355	JAQUENETTA	I beseech your grace, let this letter be read:
2356	Our parson misdoubts it; 'twas treason, he said.
2357	
2358	FERDINAND	Biron, read it over.
2359	
2360	[Giving him the paper]
2361	
2362	Where hadst thou it?
2363	
2364	JAQUENETTA	Of Costard.
2365	
2366	FERDINAND	Where hadst thou it?
2367	
2368	COSTARD	Of Dun Adramadio, Dun Adramadio.
2369	
2370	[BIRON tears the letter]
2371	
2372	FERDINAND	How now! what is in you? why dost thou tear it?
2373	
2374	BIRON	A toy, my liege, a toy: your grace needs not fear it.
2375	
2376	LONGAVILLE	It did move him to passion, and therefore let's hear it.
2377	
2378	DUMAIN	It is Biron's writing, and here is his name.
2379	
2380	[Gathering up the pieces]
2381	
2382	BIRON	[To COSTARD]  Ah, you whoreson loggerhead! you were
2383	born to do me shame.
2384	Guilty, my lord, guilty! I confess, I confess.
2385	
2386	FERDINAND	What?
2387	
2388	BIRON	That you three fools lack'd me fool to make up the mess:
2389	He, he, and you, and you, my liege, and I,
2390	Are pick-purses in love, and we deserve to die.
2391	O, dismiss this audience, and I shall tell you more.
2392	
2393	DUMAIN	Now the number is even.
2394	
2395	BIRON	True, true; we are four.
2396	Will these turtles be gone?
2397	
2398	FERDINAND	Hence, sirs; away!
2399	
2400	COSTARD	Walk aside the true folk, and let the traitors stay.
2401	
2402	[Exeunt COSTARD and JAQUENETTA]
2403	
2404	BIRON	Sweet lords, sweet lovers, O, let us embrace!
2405	As true we are as flesh and blood can be:
2406	The sea will ebb and flow, heaven show his face;
2407	Young blood doth not obey an old decree:
2408	We cannot cross the cause why we were born;
2409	Therefore of all hands must we be forsworn.
2410	
2411	FERDINAND	What, did these rent lines show some love of thine?
2412	
2413	BIRON	Did they, quoth you? Who sees the heavenly Rosaline,
2414	That, like a rude and savage man of Inde,
2415	At the first opening of the gorgeous east,
2416	Bows not his vassal head and strucken blind
2417	Kisses the base ground with obedient breast?
2418	What peremptory eagle-sighted eye
2419	Dares look upon the heaven of her brow,
2420	That is not blinded by her majesty?
2421	
2422	FERDINAND	   What zeal, what fury hath inspired thee now?
2423	My love, her mistress, is a gracious moon;
2424	She an attending star, scarce seen a light.
2425	
2426	BIRON	My eyes are then no eyes, nor I Biron:
2427	O, but for my love, day would turn to night!
2428	Of all complexions the cull'd sovereignty
2429	Do meet, as at a fair, in her fair cheek,
2430	Where several worthies make one dignity,
2431	Where nothing wants that want itself doth seek.
2432	Lend me the flourish of all gentle tongues,--
2433	Fie, painted rhetoric! O, she needs it not:
2434	To things of sale a seller's praise belongs,
2435	She passes praise; then praise too short doth blot.
2436	A wither'd hermit, five-score winters worn,
2437	Might shake off fifty, looking in her eye:
2438	Beauty doth varnish age, as if new-born,
2439	And gives the crutch the cradle's infancy:
2440	O, 'tis the sun that maketh all things shine.
2441	
2442	FERDINAND	   By heaven, thy love is black as ebony.
2443	
2444	BIRON	Is ebony like her? O wood divine!
2445	A wife of such wood were felicity.
2446	O, who can give an oath? where is a book?
2447	That I may swear beauty doth beauty lack,
2448	If that she learn not of her eye to look:
2449	No face is fair that is not full so black.
2450	
2451	FERDINAND	O paradox! Black is the badge of hell,
2452	The hue of dungeons and the suit of night;
2453	And beauty's crest becomes the heavens well.
2454	
2455	BIRON	   Devils soonest tempt, resembling spirits of light.
2456	O, if in black my lady's brows be deck'd,
2457	It mourns that painting and usurping hair
2458	Should ravish doters with a false aspect;
2459	And therefore is she born to make black fair.
2460	Her favour turns the fashion of the days,
2461	For native blood is counted painting now;
2462	And therefore red, that would avoid dispraise,
2463	Paints itself black, to imitate her brow.
2464	
2465	DUMAIN	To look like her are chimney-sweepers black.
2466	
2467	LONGAVILLE	   And since her time are colliers counted bright.
2468	
2469	FERDINAND	And Ethiopes of their sweet complexion crack.
2470	
2471	DUMAIN	   Dark needs no candles now, for dark is light.
2472	
2473	BIRON	Your mistresses dare never come in rain,
2474	For fear their colours should be wash'd away.
2475	
2476	FERDINAND	'Twere good, yours did; for, sir, to tell you plain,
2477	I'll find a fairer face not wash'd to-day.
2478	
2479	BIRON	I'll prove her fair, or talk till doomsday here.
2480	
2481	FERDINAND	   No devil will fright thee then so much as she.
2482	
2483	DUMAIN	I never knew man hold vile stuff so dear.
2484	
2485	LONGAVILLE	   Look, here's thy love: my foot and her face see.
2486	
2487	BIRON	O, if the streets were paved with thine eyes,
2488	Her feet were much too dainty for such tread!
2489	
2490	DUMAIN	O, vile! then, as she goes, what upward lies
2491	The street should see as she walk'd overhead.
2492	
2493	FERDINAND	But what of this? are we not all in love?
2494	
2495	BIRON	   Nothing so sure; and thereby all forsworn.
2496	
2497	FERDINAND	Then leave this chat; and, good Biron, now prove
2498	Our loving lawful, and our faith not torn.
2499	
2500	DUMAIN	Ay, marry, there; some flattery for this evil.
2501	
2502	LONGAVILLE	   O, some authority how to proceed;
2503	Some tricks, some quillets, how to cheat the devil.
2504	
2505	DUMAIN	Some salve for perjury.
2506	
2507	BIRON	'Tis more than need.
2508	Have at you, then, affection's men at arms.
2509	Consider what you first did swear unto,
2510	To fast, to study, and to see no woman;
2511	Flat treason 'gainst the kingly state of youth.
2512	Say, can you fast? your stomachs are too young;
2513	And abstinence engenders maladies.
2514	And where that you have vow'd to study, lords,
2515	In that each of you have forsworn his book,
2516	Can you still dream and pore and thereon look?
2517	For when would you, my lord, or you, or you,
2518	Have found the ground of study's excellence
2519	Without the beauty of a woman's face?
2520	[From women's eyes this doctrine I derive;
2521	They are the ground, the books, the academes
2522	From whence doth spring the true Promethean fire]
2523	Why, universal plodding poisons up
2524	The nimble spirits in the arteries,
2525	As motion and long-during action tires
2526	The sinewy vigour of the traveller.
2527	Now, for not looking on a woman's face,
2528	You have in that forsworn the use of eyes
2529	And study too, the causer of your vow;
2530	For where is any author in the world
2531	Teaches such beauty as a woman's eye?
2532	Learning is but an adjunct to ourself
2533	And where we are our learning likewise is:
2534	Then when ourselves we see in ladies' eyes,
2535	Do we not likewise see our learning there?
2536	O, we have made a vow to study, lords,
2537	And in that vow we have forsworn our books.
2538	For when would you, my liege, or you, or you,
2539	In leaden contemplation have found out
2540	Such fiery numbers as the prompting eyes
2541	Of beauty's tutors have enrich'd you with?
2542	Other slow arts entirely keep the brain;
2543	And therefore, finding barren practisers,
2544	Scarce show a harvest of their heavy toil:
2545	But love, first learned in a lady's eyes,
2546	Lives not alone immured in the brain;
2547	But, with the motion of all elements,
2548	Courses as swift as thought in every power,
2549	And gives to every power a double power,
2550	Above their functions and their offices.
2551	It adds a precious seeing to the eye;
2552	A lover's eyes will gaze an eagle blind;
2553	A lover's ear will hear the lowest sound,
2554	When the suspicious head of theft is stopp'd:
2555	Love's feeling is more soft and sensible
2556	Than are the tender horns of cockl'd snails;
2557	Love's tongue proves dainty Bacchus gross in taste:
2558	For valour, is not Love a Hercules,
2559	Still climbing trees in the Hesperides?
2560	Subtle as Sphinx; as sweet and musical
2561	As bright Apollo's lute, strung with his hair:
2562	And when Love speaks, the voice of all the gods
2563	Makes heaven drowsy with the harmony.
2564	Never durst poet touch a pen to write
2565	Until his ink were temper'd with Love's sighs;
2566	O, then his lines would ravish savage ears
2567	And plant in tyrants mild humility.
2568	From women's eyes this doctrine I derive:
2569	They sparkle still the right Promethean fire;
2570	They are the books, the arts, the academes,
2571	That show, contain and nourish all the world:
2572	Else none at all in ought proves excellent.
2573	Then fools you were these women to forswear,
2574	Or keeping what is sworn, you will prove fools.
2575	For wisdom's sake, a word that all men love,
2576	Or for love's sake, a word that loves all men,
2577	Or for men's sake, the authors of these women,
2578	Or women's sake, by whom we men are men,
2579	Let us once lose our oaths to find ourselves,
2580	Or else we lose ourselves to keep our oaths.
2581	It is religion to be thus forsworn,
2582	For charity itself fulfills the law,
2583	And who can sever love from charity?
2584	
2585	FERDINAND	Saint Cupid, then! and, soldiers, to the field!
2586	
2587	BIRON	Advance your standards, and upon them, lords;
2588	Pell-mell, down with them! but be first advised,
2589	In conflict that you get the sun of them.
2590	
2591	LONGAVILLE	Now to plain-dealing; lay these glozes by:
2592	Shall we resolve to woo these girls of France?
2593	
2594	FERDINAND	And win them too: therefore let us devise
2595	Some entertainment for them in their tents.
2596	
2597	BIRON	First, from the park let us conduct them thither;
2598	Then homeward every man attach the hand
2599	Of his fair mistress: in the afternoon
2600	We will with some strange pastime solace them,
2601	Such as the shortness of the time can shape;
2602	For revels, dances, masks and merry hours
2603	Forerun fair Love, strewing her way with flowers.
2604	
2605	FERDINAND	Away, away! no time shall be omitted
2606	That will betime, and may by us be fitted.
2607	
2608	BIRON	Allons! allons! Sow'd cockle reap'd no corn;
2609	And justice always whirls in equal measure:
2610	Light wenches may prove plagues to men forsworn;
2611	If so, our copper buys no better treasure.

2621	ACT V
2622	
2623	
2624	
2625	SCENE I	The same.
2626	
2627	
2628	[Enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, and DULL]
2629	
2630	HOLOFERNES	Satis quod sufficit.
2631	
2632	SIR NATHANIEL	I praise God for you, sir: your reasons at dinner
2633	have been sharp and sententious; pleasant without
2634	scurrility, witty without affection, audacious without
2635	impudency, learned without opinion, and strange with-
2636	out heresy. I did converse this quondam day with
2637	a companion of the king's, who is intituled, nomi-
2638	nated, or called, Don Adriano de Armado.
2639	
2640	HOLOFERNES	Novi hominem tanquam te: his humour is lofty, his
2641	discourse peremptory, his tongue filed, his eye
2642	ambitious, his gait majestical, and his general
2643	behavior vain, ridiculous, and thrasonical. He is
2644	too picked, too spruce, too affected, too odd, as it
2645	were, too peregrinate, as I may call it.
2646	
2647	SIR NATHANIEL	A most singular and choice epithet.
2648	
2649	[Draws out his table-book]
2650	
2651	HOLOFERNES	He draweth out the thread of his verbosity finer
2652	than the staple of his argument. I abhor such
2653	fanatical phantasimes, such insociable and
2654	point-devise companions; such rackers of
2655	orthography, as to speak dout, fine, when he should
2656	say doubt; det, when he should pronounce debt,--d,
2657	e, b, t, not d, e, t: he clepeth a calf, cauf;
2658	half, hauf; neighbour vocatur nebor; neigh
2659	abbreviated ne. This is abhominable,--which he
2660	would call abbominable: it insinuateth me of
2661	insanie: anne intelligis, domine? to make frantic, lunatic.
2662	
2663	SIR NATHANIEL	Laus Deo, bene intelligo.
2664	
2665	HOLOFERNES	Bon, bon, fort bon, Priscian! a little scratch'd,
2666	'twill serve.
2667	
2668	SIR NATHANIEL	Videsne quis venit?
2669	
2670	HOLOFERNES	Video, et gaudeo.
2671	
2672	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, MOTH, and COSTARD]
2673	
2674	DON
2675	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Chirrah!
2676	
2677	[To MOTH]
2678	
2679	HOLOFERNES	Quare chirrah, not sirrah?
2680	
2681	DON
2682	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Men of peace, well encountered.
2683	
2684	HOLOFERNES	Most military sir, salutation.
2685	
2686	MOTH	[Aside to COSTARD]  They have been at a great feast
2687	of languages, and stolen the scraps.
2688	
2689	COSTARD	O, they have lived long on the alms-basket of words.
2690	I marvel thy master hath not eaten thee for a word;
2691	for thou art not so long by the head as
2692	honorificabilitudinitatibus: thou art easier
2693	swallowed than a flap-dragon.
2694	
2695	MOTH	Peace! the peal begins.
2696	
2697	DON
2698	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	[To HOLOFERNES]  Monsieur, are you not lettered?
2699	
2700	MOTH	Yes, yes; he teaches boys the hornbook. What is a,
2701	b, spelt backward, with the horn on his head?
2702	
2703	HOLOFERNES	Ba, pueritia, with a horn added.
2704	
2705	MOTH	Ba, most silly sheep with a horn. You hear his learning.
2706	
2707	HOLOFERNES	Quis, quis, thou consonant?
2708	
2709	MOTH	The third of the five vowels, if you repeat them; or
2710	the fifth, if I.
2711	
2712	HOLOFERNES	I will repeat them,--a, e, i,--
2713	
2714	MOTH	The sheep: the other two concludes it,--o, u.
2715	
2716	DON
2717	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Now, by the salt wave of the Mediterraneum, a sweet
2718	touch, a quick venue of wit! snip, snap, quick and
2719	home! it rejoiceth my intellect: true wit!
2720	
2721	MOTH	Offered by a child to an old man; which is wit-old.
2722	
2723	HOLOFERNES	What is the figure? what is the figure?
2724	
2725	MOTH	Horns.
2726	
2727	HOLOFERNES	Thou disputest like an infant: go, whip thy gig.
2728	
2729	MOTH	Lend me your horn to make one, and I will whip about
2730	your infamy circum circa,--a gig of a cuckold's horn.
2731	
2732	COSTARD	An I had but one penny in the world, thou shouldst
2733	have it to buy gingerbread: hold, there is the very
2734	remuneration I had of thy master, thou halfpenny
2735	purse of wit, thou pigeon-egg of discretion. O, an
2736	the heavens were so pleased that thou wert but my
2737	bastard, what a joyful father wouldst thou make me!
2738	Go to; thou hast it ad dunghill, at the fingers'
2739	ends, as they say.
2740	
2741	HOLOFERNES	O, I smell false Latin; dunghill for unguem.
2742	
2743	DON
2744	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Arts-man, preambulate, we will be singled from the
2745	barbarous. Do you not educate youth at the
2746	charge-house on the top of the mountain?
2747	
2748	HOLOFERNES	Or mons, the hill.
2749	
2750	DON
2751	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	At your sweet pleasure, for the mountain.
2752	
2753	HOLOFERNES	I do, sans question.
2754	
2755	DON
2756	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sir, it is the king's most sweet pleasure and
2757	affection to congratulate the princess at her
2758	pavilion in the posteriors of this day, which the
2759	rude multitude call the afternoon.
2760	
2761	HOLOFERNES	The posterior of the day, most generous sir, is
2762	liable, congruent and measurable for the afternoon:
2763	the word is well culled, chose, sweet and apt, I do
2764	assure you, sir, I do assure.
2765	
2766	DON
2767	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sir, the king is a noble gentleman, and my familiar,
2768	I do assure ye, very good friend: for what is
2769	inward between us, let it pass. I do beseech thee,
2770	remember thy courtesy; I beseech thee, apparel thy
2771	head: and among other important and most serious
2772	designs, and of great import indeed, too, but let
2773	that pass: for I must tell thee, it will please his
2774	grace, by the world, sometime to lean upon my poor
2775	shoulder, and with his royal finger, thus, dally
2776	with my excrement, with my mustachio; but, sweet
2777	heart, let that pass. By the world, I recount no
2778	fable: some certain special honours it pleaseth his
2779	greatness to impart to Armado, a soldier, a man of
2780	travel, that hath seen the world; but let that pass.
2781	The very all of all is,--but, sweet heart, I do
2782	implore secrecy,--that the king would have me
2783	present the princess, sweet chuck, with some
2784	delightful ostentation, or show, or pageant, or
2785	antique, or firework. Now, understanding that the
2786	curate and your sweet self are good at such
2787	eruptions and sudden breaking out of mirth, as it
2788	were, I have acquainted you withal, to the end to
2789	crave your assistance.
2790	
2791	HOLOFERNES	Sir, you shall present before her the Nine Worthies.
2792	Sir, as concerning some entertainment of time, some
2793	show in the posterior of this day, to be rendered by
2794	our assistants, at the king's command, and this most
2795	gallant, illustrate, and learned gentleman, before
2796	the princess; I say none so fit as to present the
2797	Nine Worthies.
2798	
2799	SIR NATHANIEL	Where will you find men worthy enough to present them?
2800	
2801	HOLOFERNES	Joshua, yourself; myself and this gallant gentleman,
2802	Judas Maccabaeus; this swain, because of his great
2803	limb or joint, shall pass Pompey the Great; the
2804	page, Hercules,--
2805	
2806	DON
2807	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Pardon, sir; error: he is not quantity enough for
2808	that Worthy's thumb: he is not so big as the end of his club.
2809	
2810	HOLOFERNES	Shall I have audience? he shall present Hercules in
2811	minority: his enter and exit shall be strangling a
2812	snake; and I will have an apology for that purpose.
2813	
2814	MOTH	An excellent device! so, if any of the audience
2815	hiss, you may cry 'Well done, Hercules! now thou
2816	crushest the snake!' that is the way to make an
2817	offence gracious, though few have the grace to do it.
2818	
2819	DON
2820	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For the rest of the Worthies?--
2821	
2822	HOLOFERNES	I will play three myself.
2823	
2824	MOTH	Thrice-worthy gentleman!
2825	
2826	DON
2827	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Shall I tell you a thing?
2828	
2829	HOLOFERNES	We attend.
2830	
2831	DON
2832	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	We will have, if this fadge not, an antique. I
2833	beseech you, follow.
2834	
2835	HOLOFERNES	Via, goodman Dull! thou hast spoken no word all this while.
2836	
2837	DULL	Nor understood none neither, sir.
2838	
2839	HOLOFERNES	Allons! we will employ thee.
2840	
2841	DULL	I'll make one in a dance, or so; or I will play
2842	On the tabour to the Worthies, and let them dance the hay.
2843	
2844	HOLOFERNES	Most dull, honest Dull! To our sport, away!
2845

2854	ACT V
2855	
2856	
2857	
2858	SCENE II	The same.
2859	
2860	
2861	[Enter the PRINCESS, KATHARINE, ROSALINE, and MARIA]
2862	
2863	PRINCESS	Sweet hearts, we shall be rich ere we depart,
2864	If fairings come thus plentifully in:
2865	A lady wall'd about with diamonds!
2866	Look you what I have from the loving king.
2867	
2868	ROSALINE	Madame, came nothing else along with that?
2869	
2870	PRINCESS	Nothing but this! yes, as much love in rhyme
2871	As would be cramm'd up in a sheet of paper,
2872	Writ o' both sides the leaf, margent and all,
2873	That he was fain to seal on Cupid's name.
2874	
2875	ROSALINE	That was the way to make his godhead wax,
2876	For he hath been five thousand years a boy.
2877	
2878	KATHARINE	Ay, and a shrewd unhappy gallows too.
2879	
2880	ROSALINE	You'll ne'er be friends with him; a' kill'd your sister.
2881	
2882	KATHARINE	He made her melancholy, sad, and heavy;
2883	And so she died: had she been light, like you,
2884	Of such a merry, nimble, stirring spirit,
2885	She might ha' been a grandam ere she died:
2886	And so may you; for a light heart lives long.
2887	
2888	ROSALINE	What's your dark meaning, mouse, of this light word?
2889	
2890	KATHARINE	A light condition in a beauty dark.
2891	
2892	ROSALINE	We need more light to find your meaning out.
2893	
2894	KATHARINE	You'll mar the light by taking it in snuff;
2895	Therefore I'll darkly end the argument.
2896	
2897	ROSALINE	Look what you do, you do it still i' the dark.
2898	
2899	KATHARINE	So do not you, for you are a light wench.
2900	
2901	ROSALINE	Indeed I weigh not you, and therefore light.
2902	
2903	KATHARINE	You weigh me not? O, that's you care not for me.
2904	
2905	ROSALINE	Great reason; for 'past cure is still past care.'
2906	
2907	PRINCESS	Well bandied both; a set of wit well play'd.
2908	But Rosaline, you have a favour too:
2909	Who sent it? and what is it?
2910	
2911	ROSALINE	I would you knew:
2912	An if my face were but as fair as yours,
2913	My favour were as great; be witness this.
2914	Nay, I have verses too, I thank Biron:
2915	The numbers true; and, were the numbering too,
2916	I were the fairest goddess on the ground:
2917	I am compared to twenty thousand fairs.
2918	O, he hath drawn my picture in his letter!
2919	
2920	PRINCESS	Any thing like?
2921	
2922	ROSALINE	Much in the letters; nothing in the praise.
2923	
2924	PRINCESS	Beauteous as ink; a good conclusion.
2925	
2926	KATHARINE	Fair as a text B in a copy-book.
2927	
2928	ROSALINE	'Ware pencils, ho! let me not die your debtor,
2929	My red dominical, my golden letter:
2930	O, that your face were not so full of O's!
2931	
2932	KATHARINE	A pox of that jest! and I beshrew all shrows.
2933	
2934	PRINCESS	But, Katharine, what was sent to you from fair Dumain?
2935	
2936	KATHARINE	Madam, this glove.
2937	
2938	PRINCESS	                  Did he not send you twain?
2939	
2940	KATHARINE	Yes, madam, and moreover
2941	Some thousand verses of a faithful lover,
2942	A huge translation of hypocrisy,
2943	Vilely compiled, profound simplicity.
2944	
2945	MARIA	This and these pearls to me sent Longaville:
2946	The letter is too long by half a mile.
2947	
2948	PRINCESS	I think no less. Dost thou not wish in heart
2949	The chain were longer and the letter short?
2950	
2951	MARIA	Ay, or I would these hands might never part.
2952	
2953	PRINCESS	We are wise girls to mock our lovers so.
2954	
2955	ROSALINE	They are worse fools to purchase mocking so.
2956	That same Biron I'll torture ere I go:
2957	O that I knew he were but in by the week!
2958	How I would make him fawn and beg and seek
2959	And wait the season and observe the times
2960	And spend his prodigal wits in bootless rhymes
2961	And shape his service wholly to my hests
2962	And make him proud to make me proud that jests!
2963	So perttaunt-like would I o'ersway his state
2964	That he should be my fool and I his fate.
2965	
2966	PRINCESS	None are so surely caught, when they are catch'd,
2967	As wit turn'd fool: folly, in wisdom hatch'd,
2968	Hath wisdom's warrant and the help of school
2969	And wit's own grace to grace a learned fool.
2970	
2971	ROSALINE	The blood of youth burns not with such excess
2972	As gravity's revolt to wantonness.
2973	
2974	MARIA	Folly in fools bears not so strong a note
2975	As foolery in the wise, when wit doth dote;
2976	Since all the power thereof it doth apply
2977	To prove, by wit, worth in simplicity.
2978	
2979	PRINCESS	Here comes Boyet, and mirth is in his face.
2980	
2981	[Enter BOYET]
2982	
2983	BOYET	O, I am stabb'd with laughter! Where's her grace?
2984	
2985	PRINCESS	Thy news Boyet?
2986	
2987	BOYET	                  Prepare, madam, prepare!
2988	Arm, wenches, arm! encounters mounted are
2989	Against your peace: Love doth approach disguised,
2990	Armed in arguments; you'll be surprised:
2991	Muster your wits; stand in your own defence;
2992	Or hide your heads like cowards, and fly hence.
2993	
2994	PRINCESS	Saint Denis to Saint Cupid! What are they
2995	That charge their breath against us? say, scout, say.
2996	
2997	BOYET	Under the cool shade of a sycamore
2998	I thought to close mine eyes some half an hour;
2999	When, lo! to interrupt my purposed rest,
3000	Toward that shade I might behold addrest
3001	The king and his companions: warily
3002	I stole into a neighbour thicket by,
3003	And overheard what you shall overhear,
3004	That, by and by, disguised they will be here.
3005	Their herald is a pretty knavish page,
3006	That well by heart hath conn'd his embassage:
3007	Action and accent did they teach him there;
3008	'Thus must thou speak,' and 'thus thy body bear:'
3009	And ever and anon they made a doubt
3010	Presence majestical would put him out,
3011	'For,' quoth the king, 'an angel shalt thou see;
3012	Yet fear not thou, but speak audaciously.'
3013	The boy replied, 'An angel is not evil;
3014	I should have fear'd her had she been a devil.'
3015	With that, all laugh'd and clapp'd him on the shoulder,
3016	Making the bold wag by their praises bolder:
3017	One rubb'd his elbow thus, and fleer'd and swore
3018	A better speech was never spoke before;
3019	Another, with his finger and his thumb,
3020	Cried, 'Via! we will do't, come what will come;'
3021	The third he caper'd, and cried, 'All goes well;'
3022	The fourth turn'd on the toe, and down he fell.
3023	With that, they all did tumble on the ground,
3024	With such a zealous laughter, so profound,
3025	That in this spleen ridiculous appears,
3026	To cheque their folly, passion's solemn tears.
3027	
3028	PRINCESS	But what, but what, come they to visit us?
3029	
3030	BOYET	They do, they do: and are apparell'd thus.
3031	Like Muscovites or Russians, as I guess.
3032	Their purpose is to parle, to court and dance;
3033	And every one his love-feat will advance
3034	Unto his several mistress, which they'll know
3035	By favours several which they did bestow.
3036	
3037	PRINCESS	And will they so? the gallants shall be task'd;
3038	For, ladies, we shall every one be mask'd;
3039	And not a man of them shall have the grace,
3040	Despite of suit, to see a lady's face.
3041	Hold, Rosaline, this favour thou shalt wear,
3042	And then the king will court thee for his dear;
3043	Hold, take thou this, my sweet, and give me thine,
3044	So shall Biron take me for Rosaline.
3045	And change your favours too; so shall your loves
3046	Woo contrary, deceived by these removes.
3047	
3048	ROSALINE	Come on, then; wear the favours most in sight.
3049	
3050	KATHARINE	But in this changing what is your intent?
3051	
3052	PRINCESS	The effect of my intent is to cross theirs:
3053	They do it but in mocking merriment;
3054	And mock for mock is only my intent.
3055	Their several counsels they unbosom shall
3056	To loves mistook, and so be mock'd withal
3057	Upon the next occasion that we meet,
3058	With visages displayed, to talk and greet.
3059	
3060	ROSALINE	But shall we dance, if they desire to't?
3061	
3062	PRINCESS	No, to the death, we will not move a foot;
3063	Nor to their penn'd speech render we no grace,
3064	But while 'tis spoke each turn away her face.
3065	
3066	BOYET	Why, that contempt will kill the speaker's heart,
3067	And quite divorce his memory from his part.
3068	
3069	PRINCESS	Therefore I do it; and I make no doubt
3070	The rest will ne'er come in, if he be out
3071	There's no such sport as sport by sport o'erthrown,
3072	To make theirs ours and ours none but our own:
3073	So shall we stay, mocking intended game,
3074	And they, well mock'd, depart away with shame.
3075	
3076	[Trumpets sound within]
3077	
3078	BOYET	The trumpet sounds: be mask'd; the maskers come.
3079	
3080	[The Ladies mask]
3081	
3082	[Enter Blackamoors with music; MOTH; FERDINAND,
3083	BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN, in Russian habits,
3084	and masked]
3085	
3086	MOTH	All hail, the richest beauties on the earth!--
3087	
3088	BOYET	Beauties no richer than rich taffeta.
3089	
3090	MOTH	A holy parcel of the fairest dames.
3091	
3092	[The Ladies turn their backs to him]
3093	
3094	That ever turn'd their--backs--to mortal views!
3095	
3096	BIRON	[Aside to MOTH]  Their eyes, villain, their eyes!
3097	
3098	MOTH	That ever turn'd their eyes to mortal views!--Out--
3099	
3100	BOYET	True; out indeed.
3101	
3102	MOTH	Out of your favours, heavenly spirits, vouchsafe
3103	Not to behold--
3104	
3105	BIRON	[Aside to MOTH]  Once to behold, rogue.
3106	
3107	MOTH	Once to behold with your sun-beamed eyes,
3108	--with your sun-beamed eyes--
3109	
3110	BOYET	They will not answer to that epithet;
3111	You were best call it 'daughter-beamed eyes.'
3112	
3113	MOTH	They do not mark me, and that brings me out.
3114	
3115	BIRON	Is this your perfectness? be gone, you rogue!
3116	
3117	[Exit MOTH]
3118	
3119	ROSALINE	What would these strangers? know their minds, Boyet:
3120	If they do speak our language, 'tis our will:
3121	That some plain man recount their purposes
3122	Know what they would.
3123	
3124	BOYET	What would you with the princess?
3125	
3126	BIRON	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
3127	
3128	ROSALINE	What would they, say they?
3129	
3130	BOYET	Nothing but peace and gentle visitation.
3131	
3132	ROSALINE	Why, that they have; and bid them so be gone.
3133	
3134	BOYET	She says, you have it, and you may be gone.
3135	
3136	FERDINAND	Say to her, we have measured many miles
3137	To tread a measure with her on this grass.
3138	
3139	BOYET	They say, that they have measured many a mile
3140	To tread a measure with you on this grass.
3141	
3142	ROSALINE	It is not so. Ask them how many inches
3143	Is in one mile: if they have measured many,
3144	The measure then of one is easily told.
3145	
3146	BOYET	If to come hither you have measured miles,
3147	And many miles, the princess bids you tell
3148	How many inches doth fill up one mile.
3149	
3150	BIRON	Tell her, we measure them by weary steps.
3151	
3152	BOYET	She hears herself.
3153	
3154	ROSALINE	                  How many weary steps,
3155	Of many weary miles you have o'ergone,
3156	Are number'd in the travel of one mile?
3157	
3158	BIRON	We number nothing that we spend for you:
3159	Our duty is so rich, so infinite,
3160	That we may do it still without accompt.
3161	Vouchsafe to show the sunshine of your face,
3162	That we, like savages, may worship it.
3163	
3164	ROSALINE	My face is but a moon, and clouded too.
3165	
3166	FERDINAND	Blessed are clouds, to do as such clouds do!
3167	Vouchsafe, bright moon, and these thy stars, to shine,
3168	Those clouds removed, upon our watery eyne.
3169	
3170	ROSALINE	O vain petitioner! beg a greater matter;
3171	Thou now request'st but moonshine in the water.
3172	
3173	FERDINAND	Then, in our measure do but vouchsafe one change.
3174	Thou bid'st me beg: this begging is not strange.
3175	
3176	ROSALINE	Play, music, then! Nay, you must do it soon.
3177	
3178	[Music plays]
3179	
3180	Not yet! no dance! Thus change I like the moon.
3181	
3182	FERDINAND	Will you not dance? How come you thus estranged?
3183	
3184	ROSALINE	You took the moon at full, but now she's changed.
3185	
3186	FERDINAND	Yet still she is the moon, and I the man.
3187	The music plays; vouchsafe some motion to it.
3188	
3189	ROSALINE	Our ears vouchsafe it.
3190	
3191	FERDINAND	But your legs should do it.
3192	
3193	ROSALINE	Since you are strangers and come here by chance,
3194	We'll not be nice: take hands. We will not dance.
3195	
3196	FERDINAND	Why take we hands, then?
3197	
3198	ROSALINE	Only to part friends:
3199	Curtsy, sweet hearts; and so the measure ends.
3200	
3201	FERDINAND	More measure of this measure; be not nice.
3202	
3203	ROSALINE	We can afford no more at such a price.
3204	
3205	FERDINAND	Prize you yourselves: what buys your company?
3206	
3207	ROSALINE	Your absence only.
3208	
3209	FERDINAND	                  That can never be.
3210	
3211	ROSALINE	Then cannot we be bought: and so, adieu;
3212	Twice to your visor, and half once to you.
3213	
3214	FERDINAND	If you deny to dance, let's hold more chat.
3215	
3216	ROSALINE	In private, then.
3217	
3218	FERDINAND	                  I am best pleased with that.
3219	
3220	[They converse apart]
3221	
3222	BIRON	White-handed mistress, one sweet word with thee.
3223	
3224	PRINCESS	Honey, and milk, and sugar; there is three.
3225	
3226	BIRON	Nay then, two treys, and if you grow so nice,
3227	Metheglin, wort, and malmsey: well run, dice!
3228	There's half-a-dozen sweets.
3229	
3230	PRINCESS	Seventh sweet, adieu:
3231	Since you can cog, I'll play no more with you.
3232	
3233	BIRON	One word in secret.
3234	
3235	PRINCESS	Let it not be sweet.
3236	
3237	BIRON	Thou grievest my gall.
3238	
3239	PRINCESS	Gall! bitter.
3240	
3241	BIRON	Therefore meet.
3242	
3243	[They converse apart]
3244	
3245	DUMAIN	Will you vouchsafe with me to change a word?
3246	
3247	MARIA	Name it.
3248	
3249	DUMAIN	       Fair lady,--
3250	
3251	MARIA	Say you so? Fair lord,--
3252	Take that for your fair lady.
3253	
3254	DUMAIN	Please it you,
3255	As much in private, and I'll bid adieu.
3256	
3257	[They converse apart]
3258	
3259	KATHARINE	What, was your vizard made without a tongue?
3260	
3261	LONGAVILLE	I know the reason, lady, why you ask.
3262	
3263	KATHARINE	O for your reason! quickly, sir; I long.
3264	
3265	LONGAVILLE	You have a double tongue within your mask,
3266	And would afford my speechless vizard half.
3267	
3268	KATHARINE	Veal, quoth the Dutchman. Is not 'veal' a calf?
3269	
3270	LONGAVILLE	A calf, fair lady!
3271	
3272	KATHARINE	                  No, a fair lord calf.
3273	
3274	LONGAVILLE	Let's part the word.
3275	
3276	KATHARINE	No, I'll not be your half
3277	Take all, and wean it; it may prove an ox.
3278	
3279	LONGAVILLE	Look, how you butt yourself in these sharp mocks!
3280	Will you give horns, chaste lady? do not so.
3281	
3282	KATHARINE	Then die a calf, before your horns do grow.
3283	
3284	LONGAVILLE	One word in private with you, ere I die.
3285	
3286	KATHARINE	Bleat softly then; the butcher hears you cry.
3287	
3288	[They converse apart]
3289	
3290	BOYET	The tongues of mocking wenches are as keen
3291	As is the razor's edge invisible,
3292	Cutting a smaller hair than may be seen,
3293	Above the sense of sense; so sensible
3294	Seemeth their conference; their conceits have wings
3295	Fleeter than arrows, bullets, wind, thought, swifter things.
3296	
3297	ROSALINE	Not one word more, my maids; break off, break off.
3298	
3299	BIRON	By heaven, all dry-beaten with pure scoff!
3300	
3301	FERDINAND	Farewell, mad wenches; you have simple wits.
3302	
3303	PRINCESS	Twenty adieus, my frozen Muscovits.
3304	
3305	[Exeunt FERDINAND, Lords, and Blackamoors]
3306	
3307	Are these the breed of wits so wonder'd at?
3308	
3309	BOYET	Tapers they are, with your sweet breaths puff'd out.
3310	
3311	ROSALINE	Well-liking wits they have; gross, gross; fat, fat.
3312	
3313	PRINCESS	O poverty in wit, kingly-poor flout!
3314	Will they not, think you, hang themselves tonight?
3315	Or ever, but in vizards, show their faces?
3316	This pert Biron was out of countenance quite.
3317	
3318	ROSALINE	O, they were all in lamentable cases!
3319	The king was weeping-ripe for a good word.
3320	
3321	PRINCESS	Biron did swear himself out of all suit.
3322	
3323	MARIA	Dumain was at my service, and his sword:
3324	No point, quoth I; my servant straight was mute.
3325	
3326	KATHARINE	Lord Longaville said, I came o'er his heart;
3327	And trow you what he called me?
3328	
3329	PRINCESS	Qualm, perhaps.
3330	
3331	KATHARINE	Yes, in good faith.
3332	
3333	PRINCESS	Go, sickness as thou art!
3334	
3335	ROSALINE	Well, better wits have worn plain statute-caps.
3336	But will you hear? the king is my love sworn.
3337	
3338	PRINCESS	And quick Biron hath plighted faith to me.
3339	
3340	KATHARINE	And Longaville was for my service born.
3341	
3342	MARIA	Dumain is mine, as sure as bark on tree.
3343	
3344	BOYET	Madam, and pretty mistresses, give ear:
3345	Immediately they will again be here
3346	In their own shapes; for it can never be
3347	They will digest this harsh indignity.
3348	
3349	PRINCESS	Will they return?
3350	
3351	BOYET	                  They will, they will, God knows,
3352	And leap for joy, though they are lame with blows:
3353	Therefore change favours; and, when they repair,
3354	Blow like sweet roses in this summer air.
3355	
3356	PRINCESS	How blow? how blow? speak to be understood.
3357	
3358	BOYET	Fair ladies mask'd are roses in their bud;
3359	Dismask'd, their damask sweet commixture shown,
3360	Are angels vailing clouds, or roses blown.
3361	
3362	PRINCESS	Avaunt, perplexity! What shall we do,
3363	If they return in their own shapes to woo?
3364	
3365	ROSALINE	Good madam, if by me you'll be advised,
3366	Let's, mock them still, as well known as disguised:
3367	Let us complain to them what fools were here,
3368	Disguised like Muscovites, in shapeless gear;
3369	And wonder what they were and to what end
3370	Their shallow shows and prologue vilely penn'd
3371	And their rough carriage so ridiculous,
3372	Should be presented at our tent to us.
3373	
3374	BOYET	Ladies, withdraw: the gallants are at hand.
3375	
3376	PRINCESS	Whip to our tents, as roes run o'er land.
3377	
3378	[Exeunt PRINCESS, ROSALINE, KATHARINE, and MARIA]
3379	
3380	[Re-enter FERDINAND, BIRON, LONGAVILLE, and DUMAIN,
3381	in their proper habits]
3382	
3383	FERDINAND	Fair sir, God save you! Where's the princess?
3384	
3385	BOYET	Gone to her tent. Please it your majesty
3386	Command me any service to her thither?
3387	
3388	FERDINAND	That she vouchsafe me audience for one word.
3389	
3390	BOYET	I will; and so will she, I know, my lord.
3391	
3392	[Exit]
3393	
3394	BIRON	This fellow pecks up wit as pigeons pease,
3395	And utters it again when God doth please:
3396	He is wit's pedler, and retails his wares
3397	At wakes and wassails, meetings, markets, fairs;
3398	And we that sell by gross, the Lord doth know,
3399	Have not the grace to grace it with such show.
3400	This gallant pins the wenches on his sleeve;
3401	Had he been Adam, he had tempted Eve;
3402	A' can carve too, and lisp: why, this is he
3403	That kiss'd his hand away in courtesy;
3404	This is the ape of form, monsieur the nice,
3405	That, when he plays at tables, chides the dice
3406	In honourable terms: nay, he can sing
3407	A mean most meanly; and in ushering
3408	Mend him who can: the ladies call him sweet;
3409	The stairs, as he treads on them, kiss his feet:
3410	This is the flower that smiles on every one,
3411	To show his teeth as white as whale's bone;
3412	And consciences, that will not die in debt,
3413	Pay him the due of honey-tongued Boyet.
3414	
3415	FERDINAND	A blister on his sweet tongue, with my heart,
3416	That put Armado's page out of his part!
3417	
3418	BIRON	See where it comes! Behavior, what wert thou
3419	Till this madman show'd thee? and what art thou now?
3420	
3421	[Re-enter the PRINCESS, ushered by BOYET, ROSALINE,
3422	MARIA, and KATHARINE]
3423	
3424	FERDINAND	All hail, sweet madam, and fair time of day!
3425	
3426	PRINCESS	'Fair' in 'all hail' is foul, as I conceive.
3427	
3428	FERDINAND	Construe my speeches better, if you may.
3429	
3430	PRINCESS	Then wish me better; I will give you leave.
3431	
3432	FERDINAND	We came to visit you, and purpose now
3433	To lead you to our court; vouchsafe it then.
3434	
3435	PRINCESS	This field shall hold me; and so hold your vow:
3436	Nor God, nor I, delights in perjured men.
3437	
3438	FERDINAND	Rebuke me not for that which you provoke:
3439	The virtue of your eye must break my oath.
3440	
3441	PRINCESS	You nickname virtue; vice you should have spoke;
3442	For virtue's office never breaks men's troth.
3443	Now by my maiden honour, yet as pure
3444	As the unsullied lily, I protest,
3445	A world of torments though I should endure,
3446	I would not yield to be your house's guest;
3447	So much I hate a breaking cause to be
3448	Of heavenly oaths, vow'd with integrity.
3449	
3450	FERDINAND	O, you have lived in desolation here,
3451	Unseen, unvisited, much to our shame.
3452	
3453	PRINCESS	Not so, my lord; it is not so, I swear;
3454	We have had pastimes here and pleasant game:
3455	A mess of Russians left us but of late.
3456	
3457	FERDINAND	How, madam! Russians!
3458	
3459	PRINCESS	Ay, in truth, my lord;
3460	Trim gallants, full of courtship and of state.
3461	
3462	ROSALINE	Madam, speak true. It is not so, my lord:
3463	My lady, to the manner of the days,
3464	In courtesy gives undeserving praise.
3465	We four indeed confronted were with four
3466	In Russian habit: here they stay'd an hour,
3467	And talk'd apace; and in that hour, my lord,
3468	They did not bless us with one happy word.
3469	I dare not call them fools; but this I think,
3470	When they are thirsty, fools would fain have drink.
3471	
3472	BIRON	This jest is dry to me. Fair gentle sweet,
3473	Your wit makes wise things foolish: when we greet,
3474	With eyes best seeing, heaven's fiery eye,
3475	By light we lose light: your capacity
3476	Is of that nature that to your huge store
3477	Wise things seem foolish and rich things but poor.
3478	
3479	ROSALINE	This proves you wise and rich, for in my eye,--
3480	
3481	BIRON	I am a fool, and full of poverty.
3482	
3483	ROSALINE	But that you take what doth to you belong,
3484	It were a fault to snatch words from my tongue.
3485	
3486	BIRON	O, I am yours, and all that I possess!
3487	
3488	ROSALINE	All the fool mine?
3489	
3490	BIRON	                  I cannot give you less.
3491	
3492	ROSALINE	Which of the vizards was it that you wore?
3493	
3494	BIRON	Where? when? what vizard? why demand you this?
3495	
3496	ROSALINE	There, then, that vizard; that superfluous case
3497	That hid the worse and show'd the better face.
3498	
3499	FERDINAND	We are descried; they'll mock us now downright.
3500	
3501	DUMAIN	Let us confess and turn it to a jest.
3502	
3503	PRINCESS	Amazed, my lord? why looks your highness sad?
3504	
3505	ROSALINE	Help, hold his brows! he'll swoon! Why look you pale?
3506	Sea-sick, I think, coming from Muscovy.
3507	
3508	BIRON	Thus pour the stars down plagues for perjury.
3509	Can any face of brass hold longer out?
3510	Here stand I	lady, dart thy skill at me;
3511	Bruise me with scorn, confound me with a flout;
3512	Thrust thy sharp wit quite through my ignorance;
3513	Cut me to pieces with thy keen conceit;
3514	And I will wish thee never more to dance,
3515	Nor never more in Russian habit wait.
3516	O, never will I trust to speeches penn'd,
3517	Nor to the motion of a schoolboy's tongue,
3518	Nor never come in vizard to my friend,
3519	Nor woo in rhyme, like a blind harper's song!
3520	Taffeta phrases, silken terms precise,
3521	Three-piled hyperboles, spruce affectation,
3522	Figures pedantical; these summer-flies
3523	Have blown me full of maggot ostentation:
3524	I do forswear them; and I here protest,
3525	By this white glove;--how white the hand, God knows!--
3526	Henceforth my wooing mind shall be express'd
3527	In russet yeas and honest kersey noes:
3528	And, to begin, wench,--so God help me, la!--
3529	My love to thee is sound, sans crack or flaw.
3530	
3531	ROSALINE	Sans sans, I pray you.
3532	
3533	BIRON	Yet I have a trick
3534	Of the old rage: bear with me, I am sick;
3535	I'll leave it by degrees. Soft, let us see:
3536	Write, 'Lord have mercy on us' on those three;
3537	They are infected; in their hearts it lies;
3538	They have the plague, and caught it of your eyes;
3539	These lords are visited; you are not free,
3540	For the Lord's tokens on you do I see.
3541	
3542	PRINCESS	No, they are free that gave these tokens to us.
3543	
3544	BIRON	Our states are forfeit: seek not to undo us.
3545	
3546	ROSALINE	It is not so; for how can this be true,
3547	That you stand forfeit, being those that sue?
3548	
3549	BIRON	Peace! for I will not have to do with you.
3550	
3551	ROSALINE	Nor shall not, if I do as I intend.
3552	
3553	BIRON	Speak for yourselves; my wit is at an end.
3554	
3555	FERDINAND	Teach us, sweet madam, for our rude transgression
3556	Some fair excuse.
3557	
3558	PRINCESS	                  The fairest is confession.
3559	Were not you here but even now disguised?
3560	
3561	FERDINAND	Madam, I was.
3562	
3563	PRINCESS	                  And were you well advised?
3564	
3565	FERDINAND	I was, fair madam.
3566	
3567	PRINCESS	                  When you then were here,
3568	What did you whisper in your lady's ear?
3569	
3570	FERDINAND	That more than all the world I did respect her.
3571	
3572	PRINCESS	When she shall challenge this, you will reject her.
3573	
3574	FERDINAND	Upon mine honour, no.
3575	
3576	PRINCESS	Peace, peace! forbear:
3577	Your oath once broke, you force not to forswear.
3578	
3579	FERDINAND	Despise me, when I break this oath of mine.
3580	
3581	PRINCESS	I will: and therefore keep it. Rosaline,
3582	What did the Russian whisper in your ear?
3583	
3584	ROSALINE	Madam, he swore that he did hold me dear
3585	As precious eyesight, and did value me
3586	Above this world; adding thereto moreover
3587	That he would wed me, or else die my lover.
3588	
3589	PRINCESS	God give thee joy of him! the noble lord
3590	Most honourably doth unhold his word.
3591	
3592	FERDINAND	What mean you, madam? by my life, my troth,
3593	I never swore this lady such an oath.
3594	
3595	ROSALINE	By heaven, you did; and to confirm it plain,
3596	You gave me this: but take it, sir, again.
3597	
3598	FERDINAND	My faith and this the princess I did give:
3599	I knew her by this jewel on her sleeve.
3600	
3601	PRINCESS	Pardon me, sir, this jewel did she wear;
3602	And Lord Biron, I thank him, is my dear.
3603	What, will you have me, or your pearl again?
3604	
3605	BIRON	Neither of either; I remit both twain.
3606	I see the trick on't: here was a consent,
3607	Knowing aforehand of our merriment,
3608	To dash it like a Christmas comedy:
3609	Some carry-tale, some please-man, some slight zany,
3610	Some mumble-news, some trencher-knight, some Dick,
3611	That smiles his cheek in years and knows the trick
3612	To make my lady laugh when she's disposed,
3613	Told our intents before; which once disclosed,
3614	The ladies did change favours: and then we,
3615	Following the signs, woo'd but the sign of she.
3616	Now, to our perjury to add more terror,
3617	We are again forsworn, in will and error.
3618	Much upon this it is: and might not you
3619	
3620	[To BOYET]
3621	
3622	Forestall our sport, to make us thus untrue?
3623	Do not you know my lady's foot by the squier,
3624	And laugh upon the apple of her eye?
3625	And stand between her back, sir, and the fire,
3626	Holding a trencher, jesting merrily?
3627	You put our page out: go, you are allow'd;
3628	Die when you will, a smock shall be your shroud.
3629	You leer upon me, do you? there's an eye
3630	Wounds like a leaden sword.
3631	
3632	BOYET	Full merrily
3633	Hath this brave manage, this career, been run.
3634	
3635	BIRON	Lo, he is tilting straight! Peace! I have done.
3636	
3637	[Enter COSTARD]
3638	
3639	Welcome, pure wit! thou partest a fair fray.
3640	
3641	COSTARD	O Lord, sir, they would know
3642	Whether the three Worthies shall come in or no.
3643	
3644	BIRON	What, are there but three?
3645	
3646	COSTARD	No, sir; but it is vara fine,
3647	For every one pursents three.
3648	
3649	BIRON	And three times thrice is nine.
3650	
3651	COSTARD	Not so, sir; under correction, sir; I hope it is not so.
3652	You cannot beg us, sir, I can assure you, sir we know
3653	what we know:
3654	I hope, sir, three times thrice, sir,--
3655	
3656	BIRON	Is not nine.
3657	
3658	COSTARD	Under correction, sir, we know whereuntil it doth amount.
3659	
3660	BIRON	By Jove, I always took three threes for nine.
3661	
3662	COSTARD	O Lord, sir, it were pity you should get your living
3663	by reckoning, sir.
3664	
3665	BIRON	How much is it?
3666	
3667	COSTARD	O Lord, sir, the parties themselves, the actors,
3668	sir, will show whereuntil it doth amount: for mine
3669	own part, I am, as they say, but to parfect one man
3670	in one poor man, Pompion the Great, sir.
3671	
3672	BIRON	Art thou one of the Worthies?
3673	
3674	COSTARD	It pleased them to think me worthy of Pompion the
3675	Great: for mine own part, I know not the degree of
3676	the Worthy, but I am to stand for him.
3677	
3678	BIRON	Go, bid them prepare.
3679	
3680	COSTARD	We will turn it finely off, sir; we will take
3681	some care.
3682	
3683	[Exit]
3684	
3685	FERDINAND	Biron, they will shame us: let them not approach.
3686	
3687	BIRON	We are shame-proof, my lord: and tis some policy
3688	To have one show worse than the king's and his company.
3689	
3690	FERDINAND	I say they shall not come.
3691	
3692	PRINCESS	Nay, my good lord, let me o'errule you now:
3693	That sport best pleases that doth least know how:
3694	Where zeal strives to content, and the contents
3695	Dies in the zeal of that which it presents:
3696	Their form confounded makes most form in mirth,
3697	When great things labouring perish in their birth.
3698	
3699	BIRON	A right description of our sport, my lord.
3700	
3701	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO]
3702	
3703	DON
3704	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Anointed, I implore so much expense of thy royal
3705	sweet breath as will utter a brace of words.
3706	
3707	[Converses apart with FERDINAND, and delivers him a paper]
3708	
3709	PRINCESS	Doth this man serve God?
3710	
3711	BIRON	Why ask you?
3712	
3713	PRINCESS	He speaks not like a man of God's making.
3714	
3715	DON
3716	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	That is all one, my fair, sweet, honey monarch; for,
3717	I protest, the schoolmaster is exceeding
3718	fantastical; too, too vain, too too vain: but we
3719	will put it, as they say, to fortuna de la guerra.
3720	I wish you the peace of mind, most royal couplement!
3721	
3722	[Exit]
3723	
3724	FERDINAND	Here is like to be a good presence of Worthies. He
3725	presents Hector of Troy; the swain, Pompey the
3726	Great; the parish curate, Alexander; Armado's page,
3727	Hercules; the pedant, Judas Maccabaeus: And if
3728	these four Worthies in their first show thrive,
3729	These four will change habits, and present the other five.
3730	
3731	BIRON	There is five in the first show.
3732	
3733	FERDINAND	You are deceived; 'tis not so.
3734	
3735	BIRON	The pedant, the braggart, the hedge-priest, the fool
3736	and the boy:--
3737	Abate throw at novum, and the whole world again
3738	Cannot pick out five such, take each one in his vein.
3739	
3740	FERDINAND	The ship is under sail, and here she comes amain.
3741	
3742	[Enter COSTARD, for Pompey]
3743	
3744	COSTARD	I Pompey am,--
3745	
3746	BOYET	                  You lie, you are not he.
3747	
3748	COSTARD	I Pompey am,--
3749	
3750	BOYET	                  With libbard's head on knee.
3751	
3752	BIRON	Well said, old mocker: I must needs be friends
3753	with thee.
3754	
3755	COSTARD	I Pompey am, Pompey surnamed the Big--
3756	
3757	DUMAIN	The Great.
3758	
3759	COSTARD	It is, 'Great,' sir:--
3760	Pompey surnamed the Great;
3761	That oft in field, with targe and shield, did make
3762	my foe to sweat:
3763	And travelling along this coast, I here am come by chance,
3764	And lay my arms before the legs of this sweet lass of France,
3765	If your ladyship would say, 'Thanks, Pompey,' I had done.
3766	
3767	PRINCESS	Great thanks, great Pompey.
3768	
3769	COSTARD	'Tis not so much worth; but I hope I was perfect: I
3770	made a little fault in 'Great.'
3771	
3772	BIRON	My hat to a halfpenny, Pompey proves the best Worthy.
3773	
3774	[Enter SIR NATHANIEL, for Alexander]
3775	
3776	SIR NATHANIEL	When in the world I lived, I was the world's
3777	commander;
3778	By east, west, north, and south, I spread my
3779	conquering might:
3780	My scutcheon plain declares that I am Alisander,--
3781	
3782	BOYET	Your nose says, no, you are not for it stands too right.
3783	
3784	BIRON	Your nose smells 'no' in this, most tender-smelling knight.
3785	
3786	PRINCESS	The conqueror is dismay'd. Proceed, good Alexander.
3787	
3788	SIR NATHANIEL	When in the world I lived, I was the world's
3789	commander,--
3790	
3791	BOYET	Most true, 'tis right; you were so, Alisander.
3792	
3793	BIRON	Pompey the Great,--
3794	
3795	COSTARD	Your servant, and Costard.
3796	
3797	BIRON	Take away the conqueror, take away Alisander.
3798	
3799	COSTARD	[To SIR NATHANIEL]  O, sir, you have overthrown
3800	Alisander the conqueror! You will be scraped out of
3801	the painted cloth for this: your lion, that holds
3802	his poll-axe sitting on a close-stool, will be given
3803	to Ajax: he will be the ninth Worthy. A conqueror,
3804	and afeard to speak! run away for shame, Alisander.
3805	
3806	[SIR NATHANIEL retires]
3807	
3808	There, an't shall please you; a foolish mild man; an
3809	honest man, look you, and soon dashed. He is a
3810	marvellous good neighbour, faith, and a very good
3811	bowler: but, for Alisander,--alas, you see how
3812	'tis,--a little o'erparted. But there are Worthies
3813	a-coming will speak their mind in some other sort.
3814	
3815	[Enter HOLOFERNES, for Judas; and MOTH, for Hercules]
3816	
3817	HOLOFERNES	   Great Hercules is presented by this imp,
3818	Whose club kill'd Cerberus, that three-headed canis;
3819	And when he was a babe, a child, a shrimp,
3820	Thus did he strangle serpents in his manus.
3821	Quoniam he seemeth in minority,
3822	Ergo I come with this apology.
3823	Keep some state in thy exit, and vanish.
3824	
3825	[MOTH retires]
3826	
3827	Judas I am,--
3828	
3829	DUMAIN	A Judas!
3830	
3831	HOLOFERNES	Not Iscariot, sir.
3832	Judas I am, ycliped Maccabaeus.
3833	
3834	DUMAIN	Judas Maccabaeus clipt is plain Judas.
3835	
3836	BIRON	A kissing traitor. How art thou proved Judas?
3837	
3838	HOLOFERNES	Judas I am,--
3839	
3840	DUMAIN	The more shame for you, Judas.
3841	
3842	HOLOFERNES	What mean you, sir?
3843	
3844	BOYET	To make Judas hang himself.
3845	
3846	HOLOFERNES	Begin, sir; you are my elder.
3847	
3848	BIRON	Well followed: Judas was hanged on an elder.
3849	
3850	HOLOFERNES	I will not be put out of countenance.
3851	
3852	BIRON	Because thou hast no face.
3853	
3854	HOLOFERNES	What is this?
3855	
3856	BOYET	A cittern-head.
3857	
3858	DUMAIN	The head of a bodkin.
3859	
3860	BIRON	A Death's face in a ring.
3861	
3862	LONGAVILLE	The face of an old Roman coin, scarce seen.
3863	
3864	BOYET	The pommel of Caesar's falchion.
3865	
3866	DUMAIN	The carved-bone face on a flask.
3867	
3868	BIRON	Saint George's half-cheek in a brooch.
3869	
3870	DUMAIN	Ay, and in a brooch of lead.
3871	
3872	BIRON	Ay, and worn in the cap of a tooth-drawer.
3873	And now forward; for we have put thee in countenance.
3874	
3875	HOLOFERNES	You have put me out of countenance.
3876	
3877	BIRON	False; we have given thee faces.
3878	
3879	HOLOFERNES	But you have out-faced them all.
3880	
3881	BIRON	An thou wert a lion, we would do so.
3882	
3883	BOYET	Therefore, as he is an ass, let him go.
3884	And so adieu, sweet Jude! nay, why dost thou stay?
3885	
3886	DUMAIN	For the latter end of his name.
3887	
3888	BIRON	For the ass to the Jude; give it him:--Jud-as, away!
3889	
3890	HOLOFERNES	This is not generous, not gentle, not humble.
3891	
3892	BOYET	A light for Monsieur Judas! it grows dark, he may stumble.
3893	
3894	[HOLOFERNES retires]
3895	
3896	PRINCESS	Alas, poor Maccabaeus, how hath he been baited!
3897	
3898	[Enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO, for Hector]
3899	
3900	BIRON	Hide thy head, Achilles: here comes Hector in arms.
3901	
3902	DUMAIN	Though my mocks come home by me, I will now be merry.
3903	
3904	FERDINAND	Hector was but a Troyan in respect of this.
3905	
3906	BOYET	But is this Hector?
3907	
3908	FERDINAND	I think Hector was not so clean-timbered.
3909	
3910	LONGAVILLE	His leg is too big for Hector's.
3911	
3912	DUMAIN	More calf, certain.
3913	
3914	BOYET	No; he is best endued in the small.
3915	
3916	BIRON	This cannot be Hector.
3917	
3918	DUMAIN	He's a god or a painter; for he makes faces.
3919	
3920	DON
3921	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty,
3922	Gave Hector a gift,--
3923	
3924	DUMAIN	A gilt nutmeg.
3925	
3926	BIRON	A lemon.
3927	
3928	LONGAVILLE	Stuck with cloves.
3929	
3930	DUMAIN	No, cloven.
3931	
3932	DON
3933	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Peace!--
3934	The armipotent Mars, of lances the almighty
3935	Gave Hector a gift, the heir of Ilion;
3936	A man so breathed, that certain he would fight; yea
3937	From morn till night, out of his pavilion.
3938	I am that flower,--
3939	
3940	DUMAIN	That mint.
3941	
3942	LONGAVILLE	That columbine.
3943	
3944	DON
3945	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet Lord Longaville, rein thy tongue.
3946	
3947	LONGAVILLE	I must rather give it the rein, for it runs against Hector.
3948	
3949	DUMAIN	Ay, and Hector's a greyhound.
3950	
3951	DON
3952	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The sweet war-man is dead and rotten; sweet chucks,
3953	beat not the bones of the buried: when he breathed,
3954	he was a man. But I will forward with my device.
3955	
3956	[To the PRINCESS]
3957	
3958	Sweet royalty, bestow on me the sense of hearing.
3959	
3960	PRINCESS	Speak, brave Hector: we are much delighted.
3961	
3962	DON
3963	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I do adore thy sweet grace's slipper.
3964	
3965	BOYET	[Aside to DUMAIN]  Loves her by the foot,--
3966	
3967	DUMAIN	[Aside to BOYET]  He may not by the yard.
3968	
3969	DON
3970	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	This Hector far surmounted Hannibal,--
3971	
3972	COSTARD	The party is gone, fellow Hector, she is gone; she
3973	is two months on her way.
3974	
3975	DON
3976	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	What meanest thou?
3977	
3978	COSTARD	Faith, unless you play the honest Troyan, the poor
3979	wench is cast away: she's quick; the child brags in
3980	her belly already: tis yours.
3981	
3982	DON
3983	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Dost thou infamonize me among potentates? thou shalt
3984	die.
3985	
3986	COSTARD	Then shall Hector be whipped for Jaquenetta that is
3987	quick by him and hanged for Pompey that is dead by
3988	him.
3989	
3990	DUMAIN	Most rare Pompey!
3991	
3992	BOYET	Renowned Pompey!
3993	
3994	BIRON	Greater than great, great, great, great Pompey!
3995	Pompey the Huge!
3996	
3997	DUMAIN	Hector trembles.
3998	
3999	BIRON	Pompey is moved. More Ates, more Ates! stir them
4000	on! stir them on!
4001	
4002	DUMAIN	Hector will challenge him.
4003	
4004	BIRON	Ay, if a' have no man's blood in's belly than will
4005	sup a flea.
4006	
4007	DON
4008	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	By the north pole, I do challenge thee.
4009	
4010	COSTARD	I will not fight with a pole, like a northern man:
4011	I'll slash; I'll do it by the sword. I bepray you,
4012	let me borrow my arms again.
4013	
4014	DUMAIN	Room for the incensed Worthies!
4015	
4016	COSTARD	I'll do it in my shirt.
4017	
4018	DUMAIN	Most resolute Pompey!
4019	
4020	MOTH	Master, let me take you a buttonhole lower. Do you
4021	not see Pompey is uncasing for the combat? What mean
4022	you? You will lose your reputation.
4023	
4024	DON
4025	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Gentlemen and soldiers, pardon me; I will not combat
4026	in my shirt.
4027	
4028	DUMAIN	You may not deny it: Pompey hath made the challenge.
4029	
4030	DON
4031	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet bloods, I both may and will.
4032	
4033	BIRON	What reason have you for't?
4034	
4035	DON
4036	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The naked truth of it is, I have no shirt; I go
4037	woolward for penance.
4038	
4039	BOYET	True, and it was enjoined him in Rome for want of
4040	linen: since when, I'll be sworn, he wore none but
4041	a dishclout of Jaquenetta's, and that a' wears next
4042	his heart for a favour.
4043	
4044	[Enter MERCADE]
4045	
4046	MERCADE	God save you, madam!
4047	
4048	PRINCESS	Welcome, Mercade;
4049	But that thou interrupt'st our merriment.
4050	
4051	MERCADE	I am sorry, madam; for the news I bring
4052	Is heavy in my tongue. The king your father--
4053	
4054	PRINCESS	Dead, for my life!
4055	
4056	MERCADE	Even so; my tale is told.
4057	
4058	BIRON	Worthies, away! the scene begins to cloud.
4059	
4060	DON
4061	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	For mine own part, I breathe free breath. I have
4062	seen the day of wrong through the little hole of
4063	discretion, and I will right myself like a soldier.
4064	
4065	[Exeunt Worthies]
4066	
4067	FERDINAND	How fares your majesty?
4068	
4069	PRINCESS	Boyet, prepare; I will away tonight.
4070	
4071	FERDINAND	Madam, not so; I do beseech you, stay.
4072	
4073	PRINCESS	Prepare, I say. I thank you, gracious lords,
4074	For all your fair endeavors; and entreat,
4075	Out of a new-sad soul, that you vouchsafe
4076	In your rich wisdom to excuse or hide
4077	The liberal opposition of our spirits,
4078	If over-boldly we have borne ourselves
4079	In the converse of breath: your gentleness
4080	Was guilty of it. Farewell worthy lord!
4081	A heavy heart bears not a nimble tongue:
4082	Excuse me so, coming too short of thanks
4083	For my great suit so easily obtain'd.
4084	
4085	FERDINAND	The extreme parts of time extremely forms
4086	All causes to the purpose of his speed,
4087	And often at his very loose decides
4088	That which long process could not arbitrate:
4089	And though the mourning brow of progeny
4090	Forbid the smiling courtesy of love
4091	The holy suit which fain it would convince,
4092	Yet, since love's argument was first on foot,
4093	Let not the cloud of sorrow justle it
4094	From what it purposed; since, to wail friends lost
4095	Is not by much so wholesome-profitable
4096	As to rejoice at friends but newly found.
4097	
4098	PRINCESS	I understand you not: my griefs are double.
4099	
4100	BIRON	Honest plain words best pierce the ear of grief;
4101	And by these badges understand the king.
4102	For your fair sakes have we neglected time,
4103	Play'd foul play with our oaths: your beauty, ladies,
4104	Hath much deform'd us, fashioning our humours
4105	Even to the opposed end of our intents:
4106	And what in us hath seem'd ridiculous,--
4107	As love is full of unbefitting strains,
4108	All wanton as a child, skipping and vain,
4109	Form'd by the eye and therefore, like the eye,
4110	Full of strange shapes, of habits and of forms,
4111	Varying in subjects as the eye doth roll
4112	To every varied object in his glance:
4113	Which parti-coated presence of loose love
4114	Put on by us, if, in your heavenly eyes,
4115	Have misbecomed our oaths and gravities,
4116	Those heavenly eyes, that look into these faults,
4117	Suggested us to make. Therefore, ladies,
4118	Our love being yours, the error that love makes
4119	Is likewise yours: we to ourselves prove false,
4120	By being once false for ever to be true
4121	To those that make us both,--fair ladies, you:
4122	And even that falsehood, in itself a sin,
4123	Thus purifies itself and turns to grace.
4124	
4125	PRINCESS	We have received your letters full of love;
4126	Your favours, the ambassadors of love;
4127	And, in our maiden council, rated them
4128	At courtship, pleasant jest and courtesy,
4129	As bombast and as lining to the time:
4130	But more devout than this in our respects
4131	Have we not been; and therefore met your loves
4132	In their own fashion, like a merriment.
4133	
4134	DUMAIN	Our letters, madam, show'd much more than jest.
4135	
4136	LONGAVILLE	So did our looks.
4137	
4138	ROSALINE	                  We did not quote them so.
4139	
4140	FERDINAND	Now, at the latest minute of the hour,
4141	Grant us your loves.
4142	
4143	PRINCESS	A time, methinks, too short
4144	To make a world-without-end bargain in.
4145	No, no, my lord, your grace is perjured much,
4146	Full of dear guiltiness; and therefore this:
4147	If for my love, as there is no such cause,
4148	You will do aught, this shall you do for me:
4149	Your oath I will not trust; but go with speed
4150	To some forlorn and naked hermitage,
4151	Remote from all the pleasures of the world;
4152	There stay until the twelve celestial signs
4153	Have brought about the annual reckoning.
4154	If this austere insociable life
4155	Change not your offer made in heat of blood;
4156	If frosts and fasts, hard lodging and thin weeds
4157	Nip not the gaudy blossoms of your love,
4158	But that it bear this trial and last love;
4159	Then, at the expiration of the year,
4160	Come challenge me, challenge me by these deserts,
4161	And, by this virgin palm now kissing thine
4162	I will be thine; and till that instant shut
4163	My woeful self up in a mourning house,
4164	Raining the tears of lamentation
4165	For the remembrance of my father's death.
4166	If this thou do deny, let our hands part,
4167	Neither entitled in the other's heart.
4168	
4169	FERDINAND	If this, or more than this, I would deny,
4170	To flatter up these powers of mine with rest,
4171	The sudden hand of death close up mine eye!
4172	Hence ever then my heart is in thy breast.
4173	
4174	BIRON	[And what to me, my love? and what to me?
4175	
4176	ROSALINE	You must be purged too, your sins are rack'd,
4177	You are attaint with faults and perjury:
4178	Therefore if you my favour mean to get,
4179	A twelvemonth shall you spend, and never rest,
4180	But seek the weary beds of people sick]
4181	
4182	DUMAIN	But what to me, my love? but what to me? A wife?
4183	
4184	KATHARINE	A beard, fair health, and honesty;
4185	With three-fold love I wish you all these three.
4186	
4187	DUMAIN	O, shall I say, I thank you, gentle wife?
4188	
4189	KATHARINE	Not so, my lord; a twelvemonth and a day
4190	I'll mark no words that smooth-faced wooers say:
4191	Come when the king doth to my lady come;
4192	Then, if I have much love, I'll give you some.
4193	
4194	DUMAIN	I'll serve thee true and faithfully till then.
4195	
4196	KATHARINE	Yet swear not, lest ye be forsworn again.
4197	
4198	LONGAVILLE	What says Maria?
4199	
4200	MARIA	                  At the twelvemonth's end
4201	I'll change my black gown for a faithful friend.
4202	
4203	LONGAVILLE	I'll stay with patience; but the time is long.
4204	
4205	MARIA	The liker you; few taller are so young.
4206	
4207	BIRON	Studies my lady? mistress, look on me;
4208	Behold the window of my heart, mine eye,
4209	What humble suit attends thy answer there:
4210	Impose some service on me for thy love.
4211	
4212	ROSALINE	Oft have I heard of you, my Lord Biron,
4213	Before I saw you; and the world's large tongue
4214	Proclaims you for a man replete with mocks,
4215	Full of comparisons and wounding flouts,
4216	Which you on all estates will execute
4217	That lie within the mercy of your wit.
4218	To weed this wormwood from your fruitful brain,
4219	And therewithal to win me, if you please,
4220	Without the which I am not to be won,
4221	You shall this twelvemonth term from day to day
4222	Visit the speechless sick and still converse
4223	With groaning wretches; and your task shall be,
4224	With all the fierce endeavor of your wit
4225	To enforce the pained impotent to smile.
4226	
4227	BIRON	To move wild laughter in the throat of death?
4228	It cannot be; it is impossible:
4229	Mirth cannot move a soul in agony.
4230	
4231	ROSALINE	Why, that's the way to choke a gibing spirit,
4232	Whose influence is begot of that loose grace
4233	Which shallow laughing hearers give to fools:
4234	A jest's prosperity lies in the ear
4235	Of him that hears it, never in the tongue
4236	Of him that makes it: then, if sickly ears,
4237	Deaf'd with the clamours of their own dear groans,
4238	Will hear your idle scorns, continue then,
4239	And I will have you and that fault withal;
4240	But if they will not, throw away that spirit,
4241	And I shall find you empty of that fault,
4242	Right joyful of your reformation.
4243	
4244	BIRON	A twelvemonth! well; befall what will befall,
4245	I'll jest a twelvemonth in an hospital.
4246	
4247	PRINCESS	[To FERDINAND]  Ay, sweet my lord; and so I take my leave.
4248	
4249	FERDINAND	No, madam; we will bring you on your way.
4250	
4251	BIRON	Our wooing doth not end like an old play;
4252	Jack hath not Jill: these ladies' courtesy
4253	Might well have made our sport a comedy.
4254	
4255	FERDINAND	Come, sir, it wants a twelvemonth and a day,
4256	And then 'twill end.
4257	
4258	BIRON	That's too long for a play.
4259	
4260	[Re-enter DON ADRIANO DE ARMADO]
4261	
4262	DON
4263	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Sweet majesty, vouchsafe me,--
4264	
4265	PRINCESS	Was not that Hector?
4266	
4267	DUMAIN	The worthy knight of Troy.
4268	
4269	DON
4270	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	I will kiss thy royal finger, and take leave. I am
4271	a votary; I have vowed to Jaquenetta to hold the
4272	plough for her sweet love three years. But, most
4273	esteemed greatness, will you hear the dialogue that
4274	the two learned men have compiled in praise of the
4275	owl and the cuckoo? It should have followed in the
4276	end of our show.
4277	
4278	FERDINAND	Call them forth quickly; we will do so.
4279	
4280	DON
4281	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	Holla! approach.
4282	
4283	[Re-enter HOLOFERNES, SIR NATHANIEL, MOTH, COSTARD,
4284	and others]
4285	
4286	This side is Hiems, Winter, this Ver, the Spring;
4287	the one maintained by the owl, the other by the
4288	cuckoo. Ver, begin.
4289	
4290	[THE SONG]
4291	
4292	SPRING.
4293	When daisies pied and violets blue
4294	And lady-smocks all silver-white
4295	And cuckoo-buds of yellow hue
4296	Do paint the meadows with delight,
4297	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
4298	Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;
4299	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
4300	Unpleasing to a married ear!
4301	
4302	When shepherds pipe on oaten straws
4303	And merry larks are ploughmen's clocks,
4304	When turtles tread, and rooks, and daws,
4305	And maidens bleach their summer smocks
4306	The cuckoo then, on every tree,
4307	Mocks married men; for thus sings he, 	Cuckoo;
4308	Cuckoo, cuckoo: O word of fear,
4309	Unpleasing to a married ear!
4310	
4311	WINTER.
4312	When icicles hang by the wall
4313	And Dick the shepherd blows his nail
4314	And Tom bears logs into the hall
4315	And milk comes frozen home in pail,
4316	When blood is nipp'd and ways be foul,
4317	Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;
4318	Tu-who, a merry note,
4319	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
4320	
4321	When all aloud the wind doth blow
4322	And coughing drowns the parson's saw
4323	And birds sit brooding in the snow
4324	And Marian's nose looks red and raw,
4325	When roasted crabs hiss in the bowl,
4326	Then nightly sings the staring owl, 	Tu-whit;
4327	Tu-who, a merry note,
4328	While greasy Joan doth keel the pot.
4329	
4330	DON
4331	ADRIANO DE ARMADO	The words of Mercury are harsh after the songs of
4332	Apollo. You that way: we this way.
4333	
4334	[Exeunt]

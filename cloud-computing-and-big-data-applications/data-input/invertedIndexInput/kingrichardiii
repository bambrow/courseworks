132	
133	
134	ACT I
135	
136	
137	
138	SCENE I	London. A street.
139	
140	[Enter GLOUCESTER, solus]
141	
142	GLOUCESTER	Now is the winter of our discontent
143	Made glorious summer by this sun of York;
144	And all the clouds that lour'd upon our house
145	In the deep bosom of the ocean buried.
146	Now are our brows bound with victorious wreaths;
147	Our bruised arms hung up for monuments;
148	Our stern alarums changed to merry meetings,
149	Our dreadful marches to delightful measures.
150	Grim-visaged war hath smooth'd his wrinkled front;
151	And now, instead of mounting barded steeds
152	To fright the souls of fearful adversaries,
153	He capers nimbly in a lady's chamber
154	To the lascivious pleasing of a lute.
155	But I, that am not shaped for sportive tricks,
156	Nor made to court an amorous looking-glass;
157	I, that am rudely stamp'd, and want love's majesty
158	To strut before a wanton ambling nymph;
159	I, that am curtail'd of this fair proportion,
160	Cheated of feature by dissembling nature,
161	Deformed, unfinish'd, sent before my time
162	Into this breathing world, scarce half made up,
163	And that so lamely and unfashionable
164	That dogs bark at me as I halt by them;
165	Why, I, in this weak piping time of peace,
166	Have no delight to pass away the time,
167	Unless to spy my shadow in the sun
168	And descant on mine own deformity:
169	And therefore, since I cannot prove a lover,
170	To entertain these fair well-spoken days,
171	I am determined to prove a villain
172	And hate the idle pleasures of these days.
173	Plots have I laid, inductions dangerous,
174	By drunken prophecies, libels and dreams,
175	To set my brother Clarence and the king
176	In deadly hate the one against the other:
177	And if King Edward be as true and just
178	As I am subtle, false and treacherous,
179	This day should Clarence closely be mew'd up,
180	About a prophecy, which says that 'G'
181	Of Edward's heirs the murderer shall be.
182	Dive, thoughts, down to my soul: here
183	Clarence comes.
184	
185	[Enter CLARENCE, guarded, and BRAKENBURY]
186	
187	Brother, good day; what means this armed guard
188	That waits upon your grace?
189	
190	CLARENCE	His majesty
191	Tendering my person's safety, hath appointed
192	This conduct to convey me to the Tower.
193	
194	GLOUCESTER	Upon what cause?
195	
196	CLARENCE	                  Because my name is George.
197	
198	GLOUCESTER	Alack, my lord, that fault is none of yours;
199	He should, for that, commit your godfathers:
200	O, belike his majesty hath some intent
201	That you shall be new-christen'd in the Tower.
202	But what's the matter, Clarence?  may I know?
203	
204	CLARENCE	Yea, Richard, when I know; for I protest
205	As yet I do not: but, as I can learn,
206	He hearkens after prophecies and dreams;
207	And from the cross-row plucks the letter G.
208	And says a wizard told him that by G
209	His issue disinherited should be;
210	And, for my name of George begins with G,
211	It follows in his thought that I am he.
212	These, as I learn, and such like toys as these
213	Have moved his highness to commit me now.
214	
215	GLOUCESTER	Why, this it is, when men are ruled by women:
216	'Tis not the king that sends you to the Tower:
217	My Lady Grey his wife, Clarence, 'tis she
218	That tempers him to this extremity.
219	Was it not she and that good man of worship,
220	Anthony Woodville, her brother there,
221	That made him send Lord Hastings to the Tower,
222	From whence this present day he is deliver'd?
223	We are not safe, Clarence; we are not safe.
224	
225	CLARENCE	By heaven, I think there's no man is secure
226	But the queen's kindred and night-walking heralds
227	That trudge betwixt the king and Mistress Shore.
228	Heard ye not what an humble suppliant
229	Lord hastings was to her for his delivery?
230	
231	GLOUCESTER	Humbly complaining to her deity
232	Got my lord chamberlain his liberty.
233	I'll tell you what; I think it is our way,
234	If we will keep in favour with the king,
235	To be her men and wear her livery:
236	The jealous o'erworn widow and herself,
237	Since that our brother dubb'd them gentlewomen.
238	Are mighty gossips in this monarchy.
239	
240	BRAKENBURY	I beseech your graces both to pardon me;
241	His majesty hath straitly given in charge
242	That no man shall have private conference,
243	Of what degree soever, with his brother.
244	
245	GLOUCESTER	Even so; an't please your worship, Brakenbury,
246	You may partake of any thing we say:
247	We speak no treason, man: we say the king
248	Is wise and virtuous, and his noble queen
249	Well struck in years, fair, and not jealous;
250	We say that Shore's wife hath a pretty foot,
251	A cherry lip, a bonny eye, a passing pleasing tongue;
252	And that the queen's kindred are made gentle-folks:
253	How say you sir? Can you deny all this?
254	
255	BRAKENBURY	With this, my lord, myself have nought to do.
256	
257	GLOUCESTER	Naught to do with mistress Shore! I tell thee, fellow,
258	He that doth naught with her, excepting one,
259	Were best he do it secretly, alone.
260	
261	BRAKENBURY	What one, my lord?
262	
263	GLOUCESTER	Her husband, knave: wouldst thou betray me?
264	
265	BRAKENBURY	I beseech your grace to pardon me, and withal
266	Forbear your conference with the noble duke.
267	
268	CLARENCE	We know thy charge, Brakenbury, and will obey.
269	
270	GLOUCESTER	We are the queen's abjects, and must obey.
271	Brother, farewell: I will unto the king;
272	And whatsoever you will employ me in,
273	Were it to call King Edward's widow sister,
274	I will perform it to enfranchise you.
275	Meantime, this deep disgrace in brotherhood
276	Touches me deeper than you can imagine.
277	
278	CLARENCE	I know it pleaseth neither of us well.
279	
280	GLOUCESTER	Well, your imprisonment shall not be long;
281	Meantime, have patience.
282	
283	CLARENCE	I must perforce. Farewell.
284	
285	[Exeunt CLARENCE, BRAKENBURY, and Guard]
286	
287	GLOUCESTER	Go, tread the path that thou shalt ne'er return.
288	Simple, plain Clarence! I do love thee so,
289	That I will shortly send thy soul to heaven,
290	If heaven will take the present at our hands.
291	But who comes here? the new-deliver'd Hastings?
292	
293	[Enter HASTINGS]
294	
295	HASTINGS	Good time of day unto my gracious lord!
296	
297	GLOUCESTER	As much unto my good lord chamberlain!
298	Well are you welcome to the open air.
299	How hath your lordship brook'd imprisonment?
300	
301	HASTINGS	With patience, noble lord, as prisoners must:
302	But I shall live, my lord, to give them thanks
303	That were the cause of my imprisonment.
304	
305	GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; and so shall Clarence too;
306	For they that were your enemies are his,
307	And have prevail'd as much on him as you.
308	
309	HASTINGS	More pity that the eagle should be mew'd,
310	While kites and buzzards prey at liberty.
311	
312	GLOUCESTER	What news abroad?
313	
314	HASTINGS	No news so bad abroad as this at home;
315	The King is sickly, weak and melancholy,
316	And his physicians fear him mightily.
317	
318	GLOUCESTER	Now, by Saint Paul, this news is bad indeed.
319	O, he hath kept an evil diet long,
320	And overmuch consumed his royal person:
321	'Tis very grievous to be thought upon.
322	What, is he in his bed?
323	
324	HASTINGS	He is.
325	
326	GLOUCESTER	Go you before, and I will follow you.
327	
328	[Exit HASTINGS]
329	
330	He cannot live, I hope; and must not die
331	Till George be pack'd with post-horse up to heaven.
332	I'll in, to urge his hatred more to Clarence,
333	With lies well steel'd with weighty arguments;
334	And, if I fall not in my deep intent,
335	Clarence hath not another day to live:
336	Which done, God take King Edward to his mercy,
337	And leave the world for me to bustle in!
338	For then I'll marry Warwick's youngest daughter.
339	What though I kill'd her husband and her father?
340	The readiest way to make the wench amends
341	Is to become her husband and her father:
342	The which will I; not all so much for love
343	As for another secret close intent,
344	By marrying her which I must reach unto.
345	But yet I run before my horse to market:
346	Clarence still breathes; Edward still lives and reigns:
347	When they are gone, then must I count my gains.
348	
349	[Exit]

354	KING RICHARD III
355	
356	
357	ACT I
358	
359	
360	
361	SCENE II	The same. Another street.
362	
363	[Enter the corpse of KING HENRY the Sixth, Gentlemen
364	with halberds to guard it; LADY ANNE being the mourner]
365	
366	LADY ANNE	Set down, set down your honourable load,
367	If honour may be shrouded in a hearse,
368	Whilst I awhile obsequiously lament
369	The untimely fall of virtuous Lancaster.
370	Poor key-cold figure of a holy king!
371	Pale ashes of the house of Lancaster!
372	Thou bloodless remnant of that royal blood!
373	Be it lawful that I invocate thy ghost,
374	To hear the lamentations of Poor Anne,
375	Wife to thy Edward, to thy slaughter'd son,
376	Stabb'd by the selfsame hand that made these wounds!
377	Lo, in these windows that let forth thy life,
378	I pour the helpless balm of my poor eyes.
379	Cursed be the hand that made these fatal holes!
380	Cursed be the heart that had the heart to do it!
381	Cursed the blood that let this blood from hence!
382	More direful hap betide that hated wretch,
383	That makes us wretched by the death of thee,
384	Than I can wish to adders, spiders, toads,
385	Or any creeping venom'd thing that lives!
386	If ever he have child, abortive be it,
387	Prodigious, and untimely brought to light,
388	Whose ugly and unnatural aspect
389	May fright the hopeful mother at the view;
390	And that be heir to his unhappiness!
391	If ever he have wife, let her he made
392	A miserable by the death of him
393	As I am made by my poor lord and thee!
394	Come, now towards Chertsey with your holy load,
395	Taken from Paul's to be interred there;
396	And still, as you are weary of the weight,
397	Rest you, whiles I lament King Henry's corse.
398	
399	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
400	
401	GLOUCESTER	Stay, you that bear the corse, and set it down.
402	
403	LADY ANNE	What black magician conjures up this fiend,
404	To stop devoted charitable deeds?
405	
406	GLOUCESTER	Villains, set down the corse; or, by Saint Paul,
407	I'll make a corse of him that disobeys.
408	
409	Gentleman	My lord, stand back, and let the coffin pass.
410	
411	GLOUCESTER	Unmanner'd dog! stand thou, when I command:
412	Advance thy halbert higher than my breast,
413	Or, by Saint Paul, I'll strike thee to my foot,
414	And spurn upon thee, beggar, for thy boldness.
415	
416	LADY ANNE	What, do you tremble? are you all afraid?
417	Alas, I blame you not; for you are mortal,
418	And mortal eyes cannot endure the devil.
419	Avaunt, thou dreadful minister of hell!
420	Thou hadst but power over his mortal body,
421	His soul thou canst not have; therefore be gone.
422	
423	GLOUCESTER	Sweet saint, for charity, be not so curst.
424	
425	LADY ANNE	Foul devil, for God's sake, hence, and trouble us not;
426	For thou hast made the happy earth thy hell,
427	Fill'd it with cursing cries and deep exclaims.
428	If thou delight to view thy heinous deeds,
429	Behold this pattern of thy butcheries.
430	O, gentlemen, see, see! dead Henry's wounds
431	Open their congeal'd mouths and bleed afresh!
432	Blush, Blush, thou lump of foul deformity;
433	For 'tis thy presence that exhales this blood
434	From cold and empty veins, where no blood dwells;
435	Thy deed, inhuman and unnatural,
436	Provokes this deluge most unnatural.
437	O God, which this blood madest, revenge his death!
438	O earth, which this blood drink'st revenge his death!
439	Either heaven with lightning strike the
440	murderer dead,
441	Or earth, gape open wide and eat him quick,
442	As thou dost swallow up this good king's blood
443	Which his hell-govern'd arm hath butchered!
444	
445	GLOUCESTER	Lady, you know no rules of charity,
446	Which renders good for bad, blessings for curses.
447	
448	LADY ANNE	Villain, thou know'st no law of God nor man:
449	No beast so fierce but knows some touch of pity.
450	
451	GLOUCESTER	But I know none, and therefore am no beast.
452	
453	LADY ANNE	O wonderful, when devils tell the truth!
454	
455	GLOUCESTER	More wonderful, when angels are so angry.
456	Vouchsafe, divine perfection of a woman,
457	Of these supposed-evils, to give me leave,
458	By circumstance, but to acquit myself.
459	
460	LADY ANNE	Vouchsafe, defused infection of a man,
461	For these known evils, but to give me leave,
462	By circumstance, to curse thy cursed self.
463	
464	GLOUCESTER	Fairer than tongue can name thee, let me have
465	Some patient leisure to excuse myself.
466	
467	LADY ANNE	Fouler than heart can think thee, thou canst make
468	No excuse current, but to hang thyself.
469	
470	GLOUCESTER	By such despair, I should accuse myself.
471	
472	LADY ANNE	And, by despairing, shouldst thou stand excused;
473	For doing worthy vengeance on thyself,
474	Which didst unworthy slaughter upon others.
475	
476	GLOUCESTER	Say that I slew them not?
477	
478	LADY ANNE	Why, then they are not dead:
479	But dead they are, and devilish slave, by thee.
480	
481	GLOUCESTER	I did not kill your husband.
482	
483	LADY ANNE	Why, then he is alive.
484	
485	GLOUCESTER	Nay, he is dead; and slain by Edward's hand.
486	
487	LADY ANNE	In thy foul throat thou liest: Queen Margaret saw
488	Thy murderous falchion smoking in his blood;
489	The which thou once didst bend against her breast,
490	But that thy brothers beat aside the point.
491	
492	GLOUCESTER	I was provoked by her slanderous tongue,
493	which laid their guilt upon my guiltless shoulders.
494	
495	LADY ANNE	Thou wast provoked by thy bloody mind.
496	Which never dreamt on aught but butcheries:
497	Didst thou not kill this king?
498	
499	GLOUCESTER	I grant ye.
500	
501	LADY ANNE	Dost grant me, hedgehog? then, God grant me too
502	Thou mayst be damned for that wicked deed!
503	O, he was gentle, mild, and virtuous!
504	
505	GLOUCESTER	The fitter for the King of heaven, that hath him.
506	
507	LADY ANNE	He is in heaven, where thou shalt never come.
508	
509	GLOUCESTER	Let him thank me, that holp to send him thither;
510	For he was fitter for that place than earth.
511	
512	LADY ANNE	And thou unfit for any place but hell.
513	
514	GLOUCESTER	Yes, one place else, if you will hear me name it.
515	
516	LADY ANNE	Some dungeon.
517	
518	GLOUCESTER	                             Your bed-chamber.
519	
520	LADY ANNE	I'll rest betide the chamber where thou liest!
521	
522	GLOUCESTER	So will it, madam till I lie with you.
523	
524	LADY ANNE	I hope so.
525	
526	GLOUCESTER	I know so. But, gentle Lady Anne,
527	To leave this keen encounter of our wits,
528	And fall somewhat into a slower method,
529	Is not the causer of the timeless deaths
530	Of these Plantagenets, Henry and Edward,
531	As blameful as the executioner?
532	
533	LADY ANNE	Thou art the cause, and most accursed effect.
534	
535	GLOUCESTER	Your beauty was the cause of that effect;
536	Your beauty: which did haunt me in my sleep
537	To undertake the death of all the world,
538	So I might live one hour in your sweet bosom.
539	
540	LADY ANNE	If I thought that, I tell thee, homicide,
541	These nails should rend that beauty from my cheeks.
542	
543	GLOUCESTER	These eyes could never endure sweet beauty's wreck;
544	You should not blemish it, if I stood by:
545	As all the world is cheered by the sun,
546	So I by that; it is my day, my life.
547	
548	LADY ANNE	Black night o'ershade thy day, and death thy life!
549	
550	GLOUCESTER	Curse not thyself, fair creature thou art both.
551	
552	LADY ANNE	I would I were, to be revenged on thee.
553	
554	GLOUCESTER	It is a quarrel most unnatural,
555	To be revenged on him that loveth you.
556	
557	LADY ANNE	It is a quarrel just and reasonable,
558	To be revenged on him that slew my husband.
559	
560	GLOUCESTER	He that bereft thee, lady, of thy husband,
561	Did it to help thee to a better husband.
562	
563	LADY ANNE	His better doth not breathe upon the earth.
564	
565	GLOUCESTER	He lives that loves thee better than he could.
566	
567	LADY ANNE	Name him.
568	
569	GLOUCESTER	        Plantagenet.
570	
571	LADY ANNE	Why, that was he.
572	
573	GLOUCESTER	The selfsame name, but one of better nature.
574	
575	LADY ANNE	Where is he?
576	
577	GLOUCESTER	                 Here.
578	
579	[She spitteth at him]
580	
581	Why dost thou spit at me?
582	
583	LADY ANNE	Would it were mortal poison, for thy sake!
584	
585	GLOUCESTER	Never came poison from so sweet a place.
586	
587	LADY ANNE	Never hung poison on a fouler toad.
588	Out of my sight! thou dost infect my eyes.
589	
590	GLOUCESTER	Thine eyes, sweet lady, have infected mine.
591	
592	LADY ANNE	Would they were basilisks, to strike thee dead!
593	
594	GLOUCESTER	I would they were, that I might die at once;
595	For now they kill me with a living death.
596	Those eyes of thine from mine have drawn salt tears,
597	Shamed their aspect with store of childish drops:
598	These eyes that never shed remorseful tear,
599	No, when my father York and Edward wept,
600	To hear the piteous moan that Rutland made
601	When black-faced Clifford shook his sword at him;
602	Nor when thy warlike father, like a child,
603	Told the sad story of my father's death,
604	And twenty times made pause to sob and weep,
605	That all the standers-by had wet their cheeks
606	Like trees bedash'd with rain: in that sad time
607	My manly eyes did scorn an humble tear;
608	And what these sorrows could not thence exhale,
609	Thy beauty hath, and made them blind with weeping.
610	I never sued to friend nor enemy;
611	My tongue could never learn sweet smoothing word;
612	But now thy beauty is proposed my fee,
613	My proud heart sues, and prompts my tongue to speak.
614	
615	[She looks scornfully at him]
616	
617	Teach not thy lips such scorn, for they were made
618	For kissing, lady, not for such contempt.
619	If thy revengeful heart cannot forgive,
620	Lo, here I lend thee this sharp-pointed sword;
621	Which if thou please to hide in this true bosom.
622	And let the soul forth that adoreth thee,
623	I lay it naked to the deadly stroke,
624	And humbly beg the death upon my knee.
625	
626	[He lays his breast open: she offers at it with his sword]
627	
628	Nay, do not pause; for I did kill King Henry,
629	But 'twas thy beauty that provoked me.
630	Nay, now dispatch; 'twas I that stabb'd young Edward,
631	But 'twas thy heavenly face that set me on.
632	
633	[Here she lets fall the sword]
634	
635	Take up the sword again, or take up me.
636	
637	LADY ANNE	Arise, dissembler: though I wish thy death,
638	I will not be the executioner.
639	
640	GLOUCESTER	Then bid me kill myself, and I will do it.
641	
642	LADY ANNE	I have already.
643	
644	GLOUCESTER	                  Tush, that was in thy rage:
645	Speak it again, and, even with the word,
646	That hand, which, for thy love, did kill thy love,
647	Shall, for thy love, kill a far truer love;
648	To both their deaths thou shalt be accessary.
649	
650	LADY ANNE	I would I knew thy heart.
651	
652	GLOUCESTER	'Tis figured in my tongue.
653	
654	LADY ANNE	I fear me both are false.
655	
656	GLOUCESTER	Then never man was true.
657	
658	LADY ANNE	Well, well, put up your sword.
659	
660	GLOUCESTER	Say, then, my peace is made.
661	
662	LADY ANNE	That shall you know hereafter.
663	
664	GLOUCESTER	But shall I live in hope?
665	
666	LADY ANNE	All men, I hope, live so.
667	
668	GLOUCESTER	Vouchsafe to wear this ring.
669	
670	LADY ANNE	To take is not to give.
671	
672	GLOUCESTER	Look, how this ring encompasseth finger.
673	Even so thy breast encloseth my poor heart;
674	Wear both of them, for both of them are thine.
675	And if thy poor devoted suppliant may
676	But beg one favour at thy gracious hand,
677	Thou dost confirm his happiness for ever.
678	
679	LADY ANNE	What is it?
680	
681	GLOUCESTER	That it would please thee leave these sad designs
682	To him that hath more cause to be a mourner,
683	And presently repair to Crosby Place;
684	Where, after I have solemnly interr'd
685	At Chertsey monastery this noble king,
686	And wet his grave with my repentant tears,
687	I will with all expedient duty see you:
688	For divers unknown reasons. I beseech you,
689	Grant me this boon.
690	
691	LADY ANNE	With all my heart; and much it joys me too,
692	To see you are become so penitent.
693	Tressel and Berkeley, go along with me.
694	
695	GLOUCESTER	Bid me farewell.
696	
697	LADY ANNE	'Tis more than you deserve;
698	But since you teach me how to flatter you,
699	Imagine I have said farewell already.
700	
701	[Exeunt LADY ANNE, TRESSEL, and BERKELEY]
702	
703	GLOUCESTER	Sirs, take up the corse.
704	
705	GENTLEMEN	Towards Chertsey, noble lord?
706	
707	GLOUCESTER	No, to White-Friars; there attend my coining.
708	
709	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
710	
711	Was ever woman in this humour woo'd?
712	Was ever woman in this humour won?
713	I'll have her; but I will not keep her long.
714	What! I, that kill'd her husband and his father,
715	To take her in her heart's extremest hate,
716	With curses in her mouth, tears in her eyes,
717	The bleeding witness of her hatred by;
718	Having God, her conscience, and these bars
719	against me,
720	And I nothing to back my suit at all,
721	But the plain devil and dissembling looks,
722	And yet to win her, all the world to nothing!
723	Ha!
724	Hath she forgot already that brave prince,
725	Edward, her lord, whom I, some three months since,
726	Stabb'd in my angry mood at Tewksbury?
727	A sweeter and a lovelier gentleman,
728	Framed in the prodigality of nature,
729	Young, valiant, wise, and, no doubt, right royal,
730	The spacious world cannot again afford
731	And will she yet debase her eyes on me,
732	That cropp'd the golden prime of this sweet prince,
733	And made her widow to a woful bed?
734	On me, whose all not equals Edward's moiety?
735	On me, that halt and am unshapen thus?
736	My dukedom to a beggarly denier,
737	I do mistake my person all this while:
738	Upon my life, she finds, although I cannot,
739	Myself to be a marvellous proper man.
740	I'll be at charges for a looking-glass,
741	And entertain some score or two of tailors,
742	To study fashions to adorn my body:
743	Since I am crept in favour with myself,
744	Will maintain it with some little cost.
745	But first I'll turn yon fellow in his grave;
746	And then return lamenting to my love.
747	Shine out, fair sun, till I have bought a glass,
748	That I may see my shadow as I pass.
749	
750	[Exit]

754	
755	KING RICHARD III
756	
757	
758	ACT I
759	
760	
761	
762	SCENE III	The palace.
763	
764	
765	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, RIVERS, and GREY]
766	
767	RIVERS	Have patience, madam: there's no doubt his majesty
768	Will soon recover his accustom'd health.
769	
770	GREY	In that you brook it in, it makes him worse:
771	Therefore, for God's sake, entertain good comfort,
772	And cheer his grace with quick and merry words.
773	
774	QUEEN ELIZABETH	If he were dead, what would betide of me?
775	
776	RIVERS	No other harm but loss of such a lord.
777	
778	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The loss of such a lord includes all harm.
779	
780	GREY	The heavens have bless'd you with a goodly son,
781	To be your comforter when he is gone.
782	
783	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, he is young and his minority
784	Is put unto the trust of Richard Gloucester,
785	A man that loves not me, nor none of you.
786	
787	RIVERS	Is it concluded that he shall be protector?
788	
789	QUEEN ELIZABETH	It is determined, not concluded yet:
790	But so it must be, if the king miscarry.
791	
792	[Enter BUCKINGHAM and DERBY]
793	
794	GREY	Here come the lords of Buckingham and Derby.
795	
796	BUCKINGHAM	Good time of day unto your royal grace!
797	
798	DERBY	God make your majesty joyful as you have been!
799	
800	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Countess Richmond, good my Lord of Derby.
801	To your good prayers will scarcely say amen.
802	Yet, Derby, notwithstanding she's your wife,
803	And loves not me, be you, good lord, assured
804	I hate not you for her proud arrogance.
805	
806	DERBY	I do beseech you, either not believe
807	The envious slanders of her false accusers;
808	Or, if she be accused in true report,
809	Bear with her weakness, which, I think proceeds
810	From wayward sickness, and no grounded malice.
811	
812	RIVERS	Saw you the king to-day, my Lord of Derby?
813	
814	DERBY	But now the Duke of Buckingham and I
815	Are come from visiting his majesty.
816	
817	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What likelihood of his amendment, lords?
818	
819	BUCKINGHAM	Madam, good hope; his grace speaks cheerfully.
820	
821	QUEEN ELIZABETH	God grant him health! Did you confer with him?
822	
823	BUCKINGHAM	Madam, we did: he desires to make atonement
824	Betwixt the Duke of Gloucester and your brothers,
825	And betwixt them and my lord chamberlain;
826	And sent to warn them to his royal presence.
827	
828	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Would all were well! but that will never be
829	I fear our happiness is at the highest.
830	
831	[Enter GLOUCESTER, HASTINGS, and DORSET]
832	
833	GLOUCESTER	They do me wrong, and I will not endure it:
834	Who are they that complain unto the king,
835	That I, forsooth, am stern, and love them not?
836	By holy Paul, they love his grace but lightly
837	That fill his ears with such dissentious rumours.
838	Because I cannot flatter and speak fair,
839	Smile in men's faces, smooth, deceive and cog,
840	Duck with French nods and apish courtesy,
841	I must be held a rancorous enemy.
842	Cannot a plain man live and think no harm,
843	But thus his simple truth must be abused
844	By silken, sly, insinuating Jacks?
845	
846	RIVERS	To whom in all this presence speaks your grace?
847	
848	GLOUCESTER	To thee, that hast nor honesty nor grace.
849	When have I injured thee? when done thee wrong?
850	Or thee? or thee? or any of your faction?
851	A plague upon you all! His royal person,--
852	Whom God preserve better than you would wish!--
853	Cannot be quiet scarce a breathing-while,
854	But you must trouble him with lewd complaints.
855	
856	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Brother of Gloucester, you mistake the matter.
857	The king, of his own royal disposition,
858	And not provoked by any suitor else;
859	Aiming, belike, at your interior hatred,
860	Which in your outward actions shows itself
861	Against my kindred, brothers, and myself,
862	Makes him to send; that thereby he may gather
863	The ground of your ill-will, and so remove it.
864	
865	GLOUCESTER	I cannot tell: the world is grown so bad,
866	That wrens make prey where eagles dare not perch:
867	Since every Jack became a gentleman
868	There's many a gentle person made a Jack.
869	
870	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, we know your meaning, brother
871	Gloucester;
872	You envy my advancement and my friends':
873	God grant we never may have need of you!
874	
875	GLOUCESTER	Meantime, God grants that we have need of you:
876	Your brother is imprison'd by your means,
877	Myself disgraced, and the nobility
878	Held in contempt; whilst many fair promotions
879	Are daily given to ennoble those
880	That scarce, some two days since, were worth a noble.
881	
882	QUEEN ELIZABETH	By Him that raised me to this careful height
883	From that contented hap which I enjoy'd,
884	I never did incense his majesty
885	Against the Duke of Clarence, but have been
886	An earnest advocate to plead for him.
887	My lord, you do me shameful injury,
888	Falsely to draw me in these vile suspects.
889	
890	GLOUCESTER	You may deny that you were not the cause
891	Of my Lord Hastings' late imprisonment.
892	
893	RIVERS	She may, my lord, for--
894	
895	GLOUCESTER	She may, Lord Rivers! why, who knows not so?
896	She may do more, sir, than denying that:
897	She may help you to many fair preferments,
898	And then deny her aiding hand therein,
899	And lay those honours on your high deserts.
900	What may she not? She may, yea, marry, may she--
901	
902	RIVERS	What, marry, may she?
903	
904	GLOUCESTER	What, marry, may she! marry with a king,
905	A bachelor, a handsome stripling too:
906	I wis your grandam had a worser match.
907	
908	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My Lord of Gloucester, I have too long borne
909	Your blunt upbraidings and your bitter scoffs:
910	By heaven, I will acquaint his majesty
911	With those gross taunts I often have endured.
912	I had rather be a country servant-maid
913	Than a great queen, with this condition,
914	To be thus taunted, scorn'd, and baited at:
915	
916	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET, behind]
917	
918	Small joy have I in being England's queen.
919	
920	QUEEN MARGARET	And lessen'd be that small, God, I beseech thee!
921	Thy honour, state and seat is due to me.
922	
923	GLOUCESTER	What! threat you me with telling of the king?
924	Tell him, and spare not: look, what I have said
925	I will avouch in presence of the king:
926	I dare adventure to be sent to the Tower.
927	'Tis time to speak; my pains are quite forgot.
928	
929	QUEEN MARGARET	Out, devil! I remember them too well:
930	Thou slewest my husband Henry in the Tower,
931	And Edward, my poor son, at Tewksbury.
932	
933	GLOUCESTER	Ere you were queen, yea, or your husband king,
934	I was a pack-horse in his great affairs;
935	A weeder-out of his proud adversaries,
936	A liberal rewarder of his friends:
937	To royalize his blood I spilt mine own.
938	
939	QUEEN MARGARET	Yea, and much better blood than his or thine.
940	
941	GLOUCESTER	In all which time you and your husband Grey
942	Were factious for the house of Lancaster;
943	And, Rivers, so were you. Was not your husband
944	In Margaret's battle at Saint Alban's slain?
945	Let me put in your minds, if you forget,
946	What you have been ere now, and what you are;
947	Withal, what I have been, and what I am.
948	
949	QUEEN MARGARET	A murderous villain, and so still thou art.
950	
951	GLOUCESTER	Poor Clarence did forsake his father, Warwick;
952	Yea, and forswore himself,--which Jesu pardon!--
953	
954	QUEEN MARGARET	Which God revenge!
955	
956	GLOUCESTER	To fight on Edward's party for the crown;
957	And for his meed, poor lord, he is mew'd up.
958	I would to God my heart were flint, like Edward's;
959	Or Edward's soft and pitiful, like mine
960	I am too childish-foolish for this world.
961	
962	QUEEN MARGARET	Hie thee to hell for shame, and leave the world,
963	Thou cacodemon! there thy kingdom is.
964	
965	RIVERS	My Lord of Gloucester, in those busy days
966	Which here you urge to prove us enemies,
967	We follow'd then our lord, our lawful king:
968	So should we you, if you should be our king.
969	
970	GLOUCESTER	If I should be! I had rather be a pedlar:
971	Far be it from my heart, the thought of it!
972	
973	QUEEN ELIZABETH	As little joy, my lord, as you suppose
974	You should enjoy, were you this country's king,
975	As little joy may you suppose in me.
976	That I enjoy, being the queen thereof.
977	
978	QUEEN MARGARET	A little joy enjoys the queen thereof;
979	For I am she, and altogether joyless.
980	I can no longer hold me patient.
981	
982	[Advancing]
983	
984	Hear me, you wrangling pirates, that fall out
985	In sharing that which you have pill'd from me!
986	Which of you trembles not that looks on me?
987	If not, that, I being queen, you bow like subjects,
988	Yet that, by you deposed, you quake like rebels?
989	O gentle villain, do not turn away!
990	
991	GLOUCESTER	Foul wrinkled witch, what makest thou in my sight?
992	
993	QUEEN MARGARET	But repetition of what thou hast marr'd;
994	That will I make before I let thee go.
995	
996	GLOUCESTER	Wert thou not banished on pain of death?
997	
998	QUEEN MARGARET	I was; but I do find more pain in banishment
999	Than death can yield me here by my abode.
1000	A husband and a son thou owest to me;
1001	And thou a kingdom; all of you allegiance:
1002	The sorrow that I have, by right is yours,
1003	And all the pleasures you usurp are mine.
1004	
1005	GLOUCESTER	The curse my noble father laid on thee,
1006	When thou didst crown his warlike brows with paper
1007	And with thy scorns drew'st rivers from his eyes,
1008	And then, to dry them, gavest the duke a clout
1009	Steep'd in the faultless blood of pretty Rutland--
1010	His curses, then from bitterness of soul
1011	Denounced against thee, are all fall'n upon thee;
1012	And God, not we, hath plagued thy bloody deed.
1013	
1014	QUEEN ELIZABETH	So just is God, to right the innocent.
1015	
1016	HASTINGS	O, 'twas the foulest deed to slay that babe,
1017	And the most merciless that e'er was heard of!
1018	
1019	RIVERS	Tyrants themselves wept when it was reported.
1020	
1021	DORSET	No man but prophesied revenge for it.
1022	
1023	BUCKINGHAM	Northumberland, then present, wept to see it.
1024	
1025	QUEEN MARGARET	What were you snarling all before I came,
1026	Ready to catch each other by the throat,
1027	And turn you all your hatred now on me?
1028	Did York's dread curse prevail so much with heaven?
1029	That Henry's death, my lovely Edward's death,
1030	Their kingdom's loss, my woful banishment,
1031	Could all but answer for that peevish brat?
1032	Can curses pierce the clouds and enter heaven?
1033	Why, then, give way, dull clouds, to my quick curses!
1034	If not by war, by surfeit die your king,
1035	As ours by murder, to make him a king!
1036	Edward thy son, which now is Prince of Wales,
1037	For Edward my son, which was Prince of Wales,
1038	Die in his youth by like untimely violence!
1039	Thyself a queen, for me that was a queen,
1040	Outlive thy glory, like my wretched self!
1041	Long mayst thou live to wail thy children's loss;
1042	And see another, as I see thee now,
1043	Deck'd in thy rights, as thou art stall'd in mine!
1044	Long die thy happy days before thy death;
1045	And, after many lengthen'd hours of grief,
1046	Die neither mother, wife, nor England's queen!
1047	Rivers and Dorset, you were standers by,
1048	And so wast thou, Lord Hastings, when my son
1049	Was stabb'd with bloody daggers: God, I pray him,
1050	That none of you may live your natural age,
1051	But by some unlook'd accident cut off!
1052	
1053	GLOUCESTER	Have done thy charm, thou hateful wither'd hag!
1054	
1055	QUEEN MARGARET	And leave out thee? stay, dog, for thou shalt hear me.
1056	If heaven have any grievous plague in store
1057	Exceeding those that I can wish upon thee,
1058	O, let them keep it till thy sins be ripe,
1059	And then hurl down their indignation
1060	On thee, the troubler of the poor world's peace!
1061	The worm of conscience still begnaw thy soul!
1062	Thy friends suspect for traitors while thou livest,
1063	And take deep traitors for thy dearest friends!
1064	No sleep close up that deadly eye of thine,
1065	Unless it be whilst some tormenting dream
1066	Affrights thee with a hell of ugly devils!
1067	Thou elvish-mark'd, abortive, rooting hog!
1068	Thou that wast seal'd in thy nativity
1069	The slave of nature and the son of hell!
1070	Thou slander of thy mother's heavy womb!
1071	Thou loathed issue of thy father's loins!
1072	Thou rag of honour! thou detested--
1073	
1074	GLOUCESTER	Margaret.
1075	
1076	QUEEN MARGARET	        Richard!
1077	
1078	GLOUCESTER	                  Ha!
1079	
1080	QUEEN MARGARET	                  I call thee not.
1081	
1082	GLOUCESTER	I cry thee mercy then, for I had thought
1083	That thou hadst call'd me all these bitter names.
1084	
1085	QUEEN MARGARET	Why, so I did; but look'd for no reply.
1086	O, let me make the period to my curse!
1087	
1088	GLOUCESTER	'Tis done by me, and ends in 'Margaret.'
1089	
1090	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thus have you breathed your curse against yourself.
1091	
1092	QUEEN MARGARET	Poor painted queen, vain flourish of my fortune!
1093	Why strew'st thou sugar on that bottled spider,
1094	Whose deadly web ensnareth thee about?
1095	Fool, fool! thou whet'st a knife to kill thyself.
1096	The time will come when thou shalt wish for me
1097	To help thee curse that poisonous bunchback'd toad.
1098	
1099	HASTINGS	False-boding woman, end thy frantic curse,
1100	Lest to thy harm thou move our patience.
1101	
1102	QUEEN MARGARET	Foul shame upon you! you have all moved mine.
1103	
1104	RIVERS	Were you well served, you would be taught your duty.
1105	
1106	QUEEN MARGARET	To serve me well, you all should do me duty,
1107	Teach me to be your queen, and you my subjects:
1108	O, serve me well, and teach yourselves that duty!
1109	
1110	DORSET	Dispute not with her; she is lunatic.
1111	
1112	QUEEN MARGARET	Peace, master marquess, you are malapert:
1113	Your fire-new stamp of honour is scarce current.
1114	O, that your young nobility could judge
1115	What 'twere to lose it, and be miserable!
1116	They that stand high have many blasts to shake them;
1117	And if they fall, they dash themselves to pieces.
1118	
1119	GLOUCESTER	Good counsel, marry: learn it, learn it, marquess.
1120	
1121	DORSET	It toucheth you, my lord, as much as me.
1122	
1123	GLOUCESTER	Yea, and much more: but I was born so high,
1124	Our aery buildeth in the cedar's top,
1125	And dallies with the wind and scorns the sun.
1126	
1127	QUEEN MARGARET	And turns the sun to shade; alas! alas!
1128	Witness my son, now in the shade of death;
1129	Whose bright out-shining beams thy cloudy wrath
1130	Hath in eternal darkness folded up.
1131	Your aery buildeth in our aery's nest.
1132	O God, that seest it, do not suffer it!
1133	As it was won with blood, lost be it so!
1134	
1135	BUCKINGHAM	Have done! for shame, if not for charity.
1136	
1137	QUEEN MARGARET	Urge neither charity nor shame to me:
1138	Uncharitably with me have you dealt,
1139	And shamefully by you my hopes are butcher'd.
1140	My charity is outrage, life my shame
1141	And in that shame still live my sorrow's rage.
1142	
1143	BUCKINGHAM	Have done, have done.
1144	
1145	QUEEN MARGARET	O princely Buckingham I'll kiss thy hand,
1146	In sign of league and amity with thee:
1147	Now fair befal thee and thy noble house!
1148	Thy garments are not spotted with our blood,
1149	Nor thou within the compass of my curse.
1150	
1151	BUCKINGHAM	Nor no one here; for curses never pass
1152	The lips of those that breathe them in the air.
1153	
1154	QUEEN MARGARET	I'll not believe but they ascend the sky,
1155	And there awake God's gentle-sleeping peace.
1156	O Buckingham, take heed of yonder dog!
1157	Look, when he fawns, he bites; and when he bites,
1158	His venom tooth will rankle to the death:
1159	Have not to do with him, beware of him;
1160	Sin, death, and hell have set their marks on him,
1161	And all their ministers attend on him.
1162	
1163	GLOUCESTER	What doth she say, my Lord of Buckingham?
1164	
1165	BUCKINGHAM	Nothing that I respect, my gracious lord.
1166	
1167	QUEEN MARGARET	What, dost thou scorn me for my gentle counsel?
1168	And soothe the devil that I warn thee from?
1169	O, but remember this another day,
1170	When he shall split thy very heart with sorrow,
1171	And say poor Margaret was a prophetess!
1172	Live each of you the subjects to his hate,
1173	And he to yours, and all of you to God's!
1174	
1175	[Exit]
1176	
1177	HASTINGS	My hair doth stand on end to hear her curses.
1178	
1179	RIVERS	And so doth mine: I muse why she's at liberty.
1180	
1181	GLOUCESTER	I cannot blame her: by God's holy mother,
1182	She hath had too much wrong; and I repent
1183	My part thereof that I have done to her.
1184	
1185	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I never did her any, to my knowledge.
1186	
1187	GLOUCESTER	But you have all the vantage of her wrong.
1188	I was too hot to do somebody good,
1189	That is too cold in thinking of it now.
1190	Marry, as for Clarence, he is well repaid,
1191	He is frank'd up to fatting for his pains
1192	God pardon them that are the cause of it!
1193	
1194	RIVERS	A virtuous and a Christian-like conclusion,
1195	To pray for them that have done scathe to us.
1196	
1197	GLOUCESTER	So do I ever:
1198	
1199	[Aside]
1200	
1201	being well-advised.
1202	For had I cursed now, I had cursed myself.
1203	
1204	[Enter CATESBY]
1205	
1206	CATESBY	Madam, his majesty doth call for you,
1207	And for your grace; and you, my noble lords.
1208	
1209	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Catesby, we come. Lords, will you go with us?
1210	
1211	RIVERS	Madam, we will attend your grace.
1212	
1213	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
1214	
1215	GLOUCESTER	I do the wrong, and first begin to brawl.
1216	The secret mischiefs that I set abroach
1217	I lay unto the grievous charge of others.
1218	Clarence, whom I, indeed, have laid in darkness,
1219	I do beweep to many simple gulls
1220	Namely, to Hastings, Derby, Buckingham;
1221	And say it is the queen and her allies
1222	That stir the king against the duke my brother.
1223	Now, they believe it; and withal whet me
1224	To be revenged on Rivers, Vaughan, Grey:
1225	But then I sigh; and, with a piece of scripture,
1226	Tell them that God bids us do good for evil:
1227	And thus I clothe my naked villany
1228	With old odd ends stolen out of holy writ;
1229	And seem a saint, when most I play the devil.
1230	
1231	[Enter two Murderers]
1232	
1233	But, soft! here come my executioners.
1234	How now, my hardy, stout resolved mates!
1235	Are you now going to dispatch this deed?
1236	
1237	First Murderer	We are, my lord; and come to have the warrant
1238	That we may be admitted where he is.
1239	
1240	GLOUCESTER	Well thought upon; I have it here about me.
1241	
1242	[Gives the warrant]
1243	
1244	When you have done, repair to Crosby Place.
1245	But, sirs, be sudden in the execution,
1246	Withal obdurate, do not hear him plead;
1247	For Clarence is well-spoken, and perhaps
1248	May move your hearts to pity if you mark him.
1249	
1250	First Murderer	Tush!
1251	Fear not, my lord, we will not stand to prate;
1252	Talkers are no good doers: be assured
1253	We come to use our hands and not our tongues.
1254	
1255	GLOUCESTER	Your eyes drop millstones, when fools' eyes drop tears:
1256	I like you, lads; about your business straight;
1257	Go, go, dispatch.
1258	
1259	First Murderer	                  We will, my noble lord.
1260	
1261	[Exeunt]

1265	
1266	KING RICHARD III
1267	
1268	
1269	ACT I
1270	
1271	
1272	
1273	SCENE IV	London. The Tower.
1274	
1275	
1276	[Enter CLARENCE and BRAKENBURY]
1277	
1278	BRAKENBURY	Why looks your grace so heavily today?
1279	
1280	CLARENCE	O, I have pass'd a miserable night,
1281	So full of ugly sights, of ghastly dreams,
1282	That, as I am a Christian faithful man,
1283	I would not spend another such a night,
1284	Though 'twere to buy a world of happy days,
1285	So full of dismal terror was the time!
1286	
1287	BRAKENBURY	What was your dream? I long to hear you tell it.
1288	
1289	CLARENCE	Methoughts that I had broken from the Tower,
1290	And was embark'd to cross to Burgundy;
1291	And, in my company, my brother Gloucester;
1292	Who from my cabin tempted me to walk
1293	Upon the hatches: thence we looked toward England,
1294	And cited up a thousand fearful times,
1295	During the wars of York and Lancaster
1296	That had befall'n us. As we paced along
1297	Upon the giddy footing of the hatches,
1298	Methought that Gloucester stumbled; and, in falling,
1299	Struck me, that thought to stay him, overboard,
1300	Into the tumbling billows of the main.
1301	Lord, Lord! methought, what pain it was to drown!
1302	What dreadful noise of waters in mine ears!
1303	What ugly sights of death within mine eyes!
1304	Methought I saw a thousand fearful wrecks;
1305	Ten thousand men that fishes gnaw'd upon;
1306	Wedges of gold, great anchors, heaps of pearl,
1307	Inestimable stones, unvalued jewels,
1308	All scatter'd in the bottom of the sea:
1309	Some lay in dead men's skulls; and, in those holes
1310	Where eyes did once inhabit, there were crept,
1311	As 'twere in scorn of eyes, reflecting gems,
1312	Which woo'd the slimy bottom of the deep,
1313	And mock'd the dead bones that lay scatter'd by.
1314	
1315	BRAKENBURY	Had you such leisure in the time of death
1316	To gaze upon the secrets of the deep?
1317	
1318	CLARENCE	Methought I had; and often did I strive
1319	To yield the ghost: but still the envious flood
1320	Kept in my soul, and would not let it forth
1321	To seek the empty, vast and wandering air;
1322	But smother'd it within my panting bulk,
1323	Which almost burst to belch it in the sea.
1324	
1325	BRAKENBURY	Awaked you not with this sore agony?
1326	
1327	CLARENCE	O, no, my dream was lengthen'd after life;
1328	O, then began the tempest to my soul,
1329	Who pass'd, methought, the melancholy flood,
1330	With that grim ferryman which poets write of,
1331	Unto the kingdom of perpetual night.
1332	The first that there did greet my stranger soul,
1333	Was my great father-in-law, renowned Warwick;
1334	Who cried aloud, 'What scourge for perjury
1335	Can this dark monarchy afford false Clarence?'
1336	And so he vanish'd: then came wandering by
1337	A shadow like an angel, with bright hair
1338	Dabbled in blood; and he squeak'd out aloud,
1339	'Clarence is come; false, fleeting, perjured Clarence,
1340	That stabb'd me in the field by Tewksbury;
1341	Seize on him, Furies, take him to your torments!'
1342	With that, methoughts, a legion of foul fiends
1343	Environ'd me about, and howled in mine ears
1344	Such hideous cries, that with the very noise
1345	I trembling waked, and for a season after
1346	Could not believe but that I was in hell,
1347	Such terrible impression made the dream.
1348	
1349	BRAKENBURY	No marvel, my lord, though it affrighted you;
1350	I promise, I am afraid to hear you tell it.
1351	
1352	CLARENCE	O Brakenbury, I have done those things,
1353	Which now bear evidence against my soul,
1354	For Edward's sake; and see how he requites me!
1355	O God! if my deep prayers cannot appease thee,
1356	But thou wilt be avenged on my misdeeds,
1357	Yet execute thy wrath in me alone,
1358	O, spare my guiltless wife and my poor children!
1359	I pray thee, gentle keeper, stay by me;
1360	My soul is heavy, and I fain would sleep.
1361	
1362	BRAKENBURY	I will, my lord: God give your grace good rest!
1363	
1364	[CLARENCE sleeps]
1365	
1366	Sorrow breaks seasons and reposing hours,
1367	Makes the night morning, and the noon-tide night.
1368	Princes have but their tides for their glories,
1369	An outward honour for an inward toil;
1370	And, for unfelt imagination,
1371	They often feel a world of restless cares:
1372	So that, betwixt their tides and low names,
1373	There's nothing differs but the outward fame.
1374	
1375	[Enter the two Murderers]
1376	
1377	First Murderer	Ho! who's here?
1378	
1379	BRAKENBURY	In God's name what are you, and how came you hither?
1380	
1381	First Murderer	I would speak with Clarence, and I came hither on my legs.
1382	
1383	BRAKENBURY	Yea, are you so brief?
1384	
1385	Second Murderer	O sir, it is better to be brief than tedious. Show
1386	him our commission; talk no more.
1387	
1388	[BRAKENBURY reads it]
1389	
1390	BRAKENBURY	I am, in this, commanded to deliver
1391	The noble Duke of Clarence to your hands:
1392	I will not reason what is meant hereby,
1393	Because I will be guiltless of the meaning.
1394	Here are the keys, there sits the duke asleep:
1395	I'll to the king; and signify to him
1396	That thus I have resign'd my charge to you.
1397	
1398	First Murderer	Do so, it is a point of wisdom: fare you well.
1399	
1400	[Exit BRAKENBURY]
1401	
1402	Second Murderer	What, shall we stab him as he sleeps?
1403	
1404	First Murderer	No; then he will say 'twas done cowardly, when he wakes.
1405	
1406	Second Murderer	When he wakes! why, fool, he shall never wake till
1407	the judgment-day.
1408	
1409	First Murderer	Why, then he will say we stabbed him sleeping.
1410	
1411	Second Murderer	The urging of that word 'judgment' hath bred a kind
1412	of remorse in me.
1413	
1414	First Murderer	What, art thou afraid?
1415	
1416	Second Murderer	Not to kill him, having a warrant for it; but to be
1417	damned for killing him, from which no warrant can defend us.
1418	
1419	First Murderer	I thought thou hadst been resolute.
1420	
1421	Second Murderer	So I am, to let him live.
1422	
1423	First Murderer	Back to the Duke of Gloucester, tell him so.
1424	
1425	Second Murderer	I pray thee, stay a while: I hope my holy humour
1426	will change; 'twas wont to hold me but while one
1427	would tell twenty.
1428	
1429	First Murderer	How dost thou feel thyself now?
1430	
1431	Second Murderer	'Faith, some certain dregs of conscience are yet
1432	within me.
1433	
1434	First Murderer	Remember our reward, when the deed is done.
1435	
1436	Second Murderer	'Zounds, he dies: I had forgot the reward.
1437	
1438	First Murderer	Where is thy conscience now?
1439	
1440	Second Murderer	In the Duke of Gloucester's purse.
1441	
1442	First Murderer	So when he opens his purse to give us our reward,
1443	thy conscience flies out.
1444	
1445	Second Murderer	Let it go; there's few or none will entertain it.
1446	
1447	First Murderer	How if it come to thee again?
1448	
1449	Second Murderer	I'll not meddle with it: it is a dangerous thing: it
1450	makes a man a coward: a man cannot steal, but it
1451	accuseth him; he cannot swear, but it cheques him;
1452	he cannot lie with his neighbour's wife, but it
1453	detects him: 'tis a blushing shamefast spirit that
1454	mutinies in a man's bosom; it fills one full of
1455	obstacles: it made me once restore a purse of gold
1456	that I found; it beggars any man that keeps it: it
1457	is turned out of all towns and cities for a
1458	dangerous thing; and every man that means to live
1459	well endeavours to trust to himself and to live
1460	without it.
1461	
1462	First Murderer	'Zounds, it is even now at my elbow, persuading me
1463	not to kill the duke.
1464	
1465	Second Murderer	Take the devil in thy mind, and relieve him not: he
1466	would insinuate with thee but to make thee sigh.
1467	
1468	First Murderer	Tut, I am strong-framed, he cannot prevail with me,
1469	I warrant thee.
1470	
1471	Second Murderer	Spoke like a tail fellow that respects his
1472	reputation. Come, shall we to this gear?
1473	
1474	First Murderer	Take him over the costard with the hilts of thy
1475	sword, and then we will chop him in the malmsey-butt
1476	in the next room.
1477	
1478	Second Murderer	O excellent devise! make a sop of him.
1479	
1480	First Murderer	Hark! he stirs: shall I strike?
1481	
1482	Second Murderer	No, first let's reason with him.
1483	
1484	CLARENCE	Where art thou, keeper? give me a cup of wine.
1485	
1486	Second murderer	You shall have wine enough, my lord, anon.
1487	
1488	CLARENCE	In God's name, what art thou?
1489	
1490	Second Murderer	A man, as you are.
1491	
1492	CLARENCE	But not, as I am, royal.
1493	
1494	Second Murderer	Nor you, as we are, loyal.
1495	
1496	CLARENCE	Thy voice is thunder, but thy looks are humble.
1497	
1498	Second Murderer	My voice is now the king's, my looks mine own.
1499	
1500	CLARENCE	How darkly and how deadly dost thou speak!
1501	Your eyes do menace me: why look you pale?
1502	Who sent you hither? Wherefore do you come?
1503	
1504	Both	To, to, to--
1505	
1506	CLARENCE	To murder me?
1507	
1508	Both	Ay, ay.
1509	
1510	CLARENCE	You scarcely have the hearts to tell me so,
1511	And therefore cannot have the hearts to do it.
1512	Wherein, my friends, have I offended you?
1513	
1514	First Murderer	Offended us you have not, but the king.
1515	
1516	CLARENCE	I shall be reconciled to him again.
1517	
1518	Second Murderer	Never, my lord; therefore prepare to die.
1519	
1520	CLARENCE	Are you call'd forth from out a world of men
1521	To slay the innocent? What is my offence?
1522	Where are the evidence that do accuse me?
1523	What lawful quest have given their verdict up
1524	Unto the frowning judge? or who pronounced
1525	The bitter sentence of poor Clarence' death?
1526	Before I be convict by course of law,
1527	To threaten me with death is most unlawful.
1528	I charge you, as you hope to have redemption
1529	By Christ's dear blood shed for our grievous sins,
1530	That you depart and lay no hands on me
1531	The deed you undertake is damnable.
1532	
1533	First Murderer	What we will do, we do upon command.
1534	
1535	Second Murderer	And he that hath commanded is the king.
1536	
1537	CLARENCE	Erroneous vassal! the great King of kings
1538	Hath in the tables of his law commanded
1539	That thou shalt do no murder: and wilt thou, then,
1540	Spurn at his edict and fulfil a man's?
1541	Take heed; for he holds vengeance in his hands,
1542	To hurl upon their heads that break his law.
1543	
1544	Second Murderer	And that same vengeance doth he hurl on thee,
1545	For false forswearing and for murder too:
1546	Thou didst receive the holy sacrament,
1547	To fight in quarrel of the house of Lancaster.
1548	
1549	First Murderer	And, like a traitor to the name of God,
1550	Didst break that vow; and with thy treacherous blade
1551	Unrip'dst the bowels of thy sovereign's son.
1552	
1553	Second Murderer	Whom thou wert sworn to cherish and defend.
1554	
1555	First Murderer	How canst thou urge God's dreadful law to us,
1556	When thou hast broke it in so dear degree?
1557	
1558	CLARENCE	Alas! for whose sake did I that ill deed?
1559	For Edward, for my brother, for his sake: Why, sirs,
1560	He sends ye not to murder me for this
1561	For in this sin he is as deep as I.
1562	If God will be revenged for this deed.
1563	O, know you yet, he doth it publicly,
1564	Take not the quarrel from his powerful arm;
1565	He needs no indirect nor lawless course
1566	To cut off those that have offended him.
1567	
1568	First Murderer	Who made thee, then, a bloody minister,
1569	When gallant-springing brave Plantagenet,
1570	That princely novice, was struck dead by thee?
1571	
1572	CLARENCE	My brother's love, the devil, and my rage.
1573	
1574	First Murderer	Thy brother's love, our duty, and thy fault,
1575	Provoke us hither now to slaughter thee.
1576	
1577	CLARENCE	Oh, if you love my brother, hate not me;
1578	I am his brother, and I love him well.
1579	If you be hired for meed, go back again,
1580	And I will send you to my brother Gloucester,
1581	Who shall reward you better for my life
1582	Than Edward will for tidings of my death.
1583	
1584	Second Murderer	You are deceived, your brother Gloucester hates you.
1585	
1586	CLARENCE	O, no, he loves me, and he holds me dear:
1587	Go you to him from me.
1588	
1589	Both	Ay, so we will.
1590	
1591	CLARENCE	Tell him, when that our princely father York
1592	Bless'd his three sons with his victorious arm,
1593	And charged us from his soul to love each other,
1594	He little thought of this divided friendship:
1595	Bid Gloucester think of this, and he will weep.
1596	
1597	First Murderer	Ay, millstones; as be lesson'd us to weep.
1598	
1599	CLARENCE	O, do not slander him, for he is kind.
1600	
1601	First Murderer	Right,
1602	As snow in harvest. Thou deceivest thyself:
1603	'Tis he that sent us hither now to slaughter thee.
1604	
1605	CLARENCE	It cannot be; for when I parted with him,
1606	He hugg'd me in his arms, and swore, with sobs,
1607	That he would labour my delivery.
1608	
1609	Second Murderer	Why, so he doth, now he delivers thee
1610	From this world's thraldom to the joys of heaven.
1611	
1612	First Murderer	Make peace with God, for you must die, my lord.
1613	
1614	CLARENCE	Hast thou that holy feeling in thy soul,
1615	To counsel me to make my peace with God,
1616	And art thou yet to thy own soul so blind,
1617	That thou wilt war with God by murdering me?
1618	Ah, sirs, consider, he that set you on
1619	To do this deed will hate you for the deed.
1620	
1621	Second Murderer	What shall we do?
1622	
1623	CLARENCE	                  Relent, and save your souls.
1624	
1625	First Murderer	Relent! 'tis cowardly and womanish.
1626	
1627	CLARENCE	Not to relent is beastly, savage, devilish.
1628	Which of you, if you were a prince's son,
1629	Being pent from liberty, as I am now,
1630	if two such murderers as yourselves came to you,
1631	Would not entreat for life?
1632	My friend, I spy some pity in thy looks:
1633	O, if thine eye be not a flatterer,
1634	Come thou on my side, and entreat for me,
1635	As you would beg, were you in my distress
1636	A begging prince what beggar pities not?
1637	
1638	Second Murderer	Look behind you, my lord.
1639	
1640	First Murderer	Take that, and that: if all this will not do,
1641	
1642	[Stabs him]
1643	
1644	I'll drown you in the malmsey-butt within.
1645	
1646	[Exit, with the body]
1647	
1648	Second Murderer	A bloody deed, and desperately dispatch'd!
1649	How fain, like Pilate, would I wash my hands
1650	Of this most grievous guilty murder done!
1651	
1652	[Re-enter First Murderer]
1653	
1654	First Murderer	How now! what mean'st thou, that thou help'st me not?
1655	By heavens, the duke shall know how slack thou art!
1656	
1657	Second Murderer	I would he knew that I had saved his brother!
1658	Take thou the fee, and tell him what I say;
1659	For I repent me that the duke is slain.
1660	
1661	[Exit]
1662	
1663	First Murderer	So do not I: go, coward as thou art.
1664	Now must I hide his body in some hole,
1665	Until the duke take order for his burial:
1666	And when I have my meed, I must away;
1667	For this will out, and here I must not stay.

1679	SCENE I	London. The palace.
1680	
1681	
1682	[Flourish. Enter KING EDWARD IV sick, QUEEN
1683	ELIZABETH, DORSET, RIVERS, HASTINGS, BUCKINGHAM,
1684	GREY, and others]
1685	
1686	KING EDWARD IV	Why, so: now have I done a good day's work:
1687	You peers, continue this united league:
1688	I every day expect an embassage
1689	From my Redeemer to redeem me hence;
1690	And now in peace my soul shall part to heaven,
1691	Since I have set my friends at peace on earth.
1692	Rivers and Hastings, take each other's hand;
1693	Dissemble not your hatred, swear your love.
1694	
1695	RIVERS	By heaven, my heart is purged from grudging hate:
1696	And with my hand I seal my true heart's love.
1697	
1698	HASTINGS	So thrive I, as I truly swear the like!
1699	
1700	KING EDWARD IV	Take heed you dally not before your king;
1701	Lest he that is the supreme King of kings
1702	Confound your hidden falsehood, and award
1703	Either of you to be the other's end.
1704	
1705	HASTINGS	So prosper I, as I swear perfect love!
1706	
1707	RIVERS	And I, as I love Hastings with my heart!
1708	
1709	KING EDWARD IV	Madam, yourself are not exempt in this,
1710	Nor your son Dorset, Buckingham, nor you;
1711	You have been factious one against the other,
1712	Wife, love Lord Hastings, let him kiss your hand;
1713	And what you do, do it unfeignedly.
1714	
1715	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Here, Hastings; I will never more remember
1716	Our former hatred, so thrive I and mine!
1717	
1718	KING EDWARD IV	Dorset, embrace him; Hastings, love lord marquess.
1719	
1720	DORSET	This interchange of love, I here protest,
1721	Upon my part shall be unviolable.
1722	
1723	HASTINGS	And so swear I, my lord
1724	
1725	[They embrace]
1726	
1727	KING EDWARD IV	Now, princely Buckingham, seal thou this league
1728	With thy embracements to my wife's allies,
1729	And make me happy in your unity.
1730	
1731	BUCKINGHAM	Whenever Buckingham doth turn his hate
1732	On you or yours,
1733	
1734	[To the Queen]
1735	
1736	but with all duteous love
1737	Doth cherish you and yours, God punish me
1738	With hate in those where I expect most love!
1739	When I have most need to employ a friend,
1740	And most assured that he is a friend
1741	Deep, hollow, treacherous, and full of guile,
1742	Be he unto me! this do I beg of God,
1743	When I am cold in zeal to yours.
1744	
1745	KING EDWARD IV	A pleasing cordial, princely Buckingham,
1746	is this thy vow unto my sickly heart.
1747	There wanteth now our brother Gloucester here,
1748	To make the perfect period of this peace.
1749	
1750	BUCKINGHAM	And, in good time, here comes the noble duke.
1751	
1752	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
1753	
1754	GLOUCESTER	Good morrow to my sovereign king and queen:
1755	And, princely peers, a happy time of day!
1756	
1757	KING EDWARD IV	Happy, indeed, as we have spent the day.
1758	Brother, we done deeds of charity;
1759	Made peace enmity, fair love of hate,
1760	Between these swelling wrong-incensed peers.
1761	
1762	GLOUCESTER	A blessed labour, my most sovereign liege:
1763	Amongst this princely heap, if any here,
1764	By false intelligence, or wrong surmise,
1765	Hold me a foe;
1766	If I unwittingly, or in my rage,
1767	Have aught committed that is hardly borne
1768	By any in this presence, I desire
1769	To reconcile me to his friendly peace:
1770	'Tis death to me to be at enmity;
1771	I hate it, and desire all good men's love.
1772	First, madam, I entreat true peace of you,
1773	Which I will purchase with my duteous service;
1774	Of you, my noble cousin Buckingham,
1775	If ever any grudge were lodged between us;
1776	Of you, Lord Rivers, and, Lord Grey, of you;
1777	That without desert have frown'd on me;
1778	Dukes, earls, lords, gentlemen; indeed, of all.
1779	I do not know that Englishman alive
1780	With whom my soul is any jot at odds
1781	More than the infant that is born to-night
1782	I thank my God for my humility.
1783	
1784	QUEEN ELIZABETH	A holy day shall this be kept hereafter:
1785	I would to God all strifes were well compounded.
1786	My sovereign liege, I do beseech your majesty
1787	To take our brother Clarence to your grace.
1788	
1789	GLOUCESTER	Why, madam, have I offer'd love for this
1790	To be so bouted in this royal presence?
1791	Who knows not that the noble duke is dead?
1792	
1793	[They all start]
1794	
1795	You do him injury to scorn his corse.
1796	
1797	RIVERS	Who knows not he is dead! who knows he is?
1798	
1799	QUEEN ELIZABETH	All seeing heaven, what a world is this!
1800	
1801	BUCKINGHAM	Look I so pale, Lord Dorset, as the rest?
1802	
1803	DORSET	Ay, my good lord; and no one in this presence
1804	But his red colour hath forsook his cheeks.
1805	
1806	KING EDWARD IV	Is Clarence dead? the order was reversed.
1807	
1808	GLOUCESTER	But he, poor soul, by your first order died,
1809	And that a winged Mercury did bear:
1810	Some tardy cripple bore the countermand,
1811	That came too lag to see him buried.
1812	God grant that some, less noble and less loyal,
1813	Nearer in bloody thoughts, but not in blood,
1814	Deserve not worse than wretched Clarence did,
1815	And yet go current from suspicion!
1816	
1817	[Enter DERBY]
1818	
1819	DORSET	A boon, my sovereign, for my service done!
1820	
1821	KING EDWARD IV	I pray thee, peace: my soul is full of sorrow.
1822	
1823	DORSET	I will not rise, unless your highness grant.
1824	
1825	KING EDWARD IV	Then speak at once what is it thou demand'st.
1826	
1827	DORSET	The forfeit, sovereign, of my servant's life;
1828	Who slew to-day a righteous gentleman
1829	Lately attendant on the Duke of Norfolk.
1830	
1831	KING EDWARD IV	Have a tongue to doom my brother's death,
1832	And shall the same give pardon to a slave?
1833	My brother slew no man; his fault was thought,
1834	And yet his punishment was cruel death.
1835	Who sued to me for him? who, in my rage,
1836	Kneel'd at my feet, and bade me be advised
1837	Who spake of brotherhood? who spake of love?
1838	Who told me how the poor soul did forsake
1839	The mighty Warwick, and did fight for me?
1840	Who told me, in the field by Tewksbury
1841	When Oxford had me down, he rescued me,
1842	And said, 'Dear brother, live, and be a king'?
1843	Who told me, when we both lay in the field
1844	Frozen almost to death, how he did lap me
1845	Even in his own garments, and gave himself,
1846	All thin and naked, to the numb cold night?
1847	All this from my remembrance brutish wrath
1848	Sinfully pluck'd, and not a man of you
1849	Had so much grace to put it in my mind.
1850	But when your carters or your waiting-vassals
1851	Have done a drunken slaughter, and defaced
1852	The precious image of our dear Redeemer,
1853	You straight are on your knees for pardon, pardon;
1854	And I unjustly too, must grant it you
1855	But for my brother not a man would speak,
1856	Nor I, ungracious, speak unto myself
1857	For him, poor soul. The proudest of you all
1858	Have been beholding to him in his life;
1859	Yet none of you would once plead for his life.
1860	O God, I fear thy justice will take hold
1861	On me, and you, and mine, and yours for this!
1862	Come, Hastings, help me to my closet.
1863	Oh, poor Clarence!
1864	
1865	[Exeunt some with KING EDWARD IV and QUEEN MARGARET]
1866	
1867	GLOUCESTER	This is the fruit of rashness! Mark'd you not
1868	How that the guilty kindred of the queen
1869	Look'd pale when they did hear of Clarence' death?
1870	O, they did urge it still unto the king!
1871	God will revenge it. But come, let us in,
1872	To comfort Edward with our company.
1873	
1874	BUCKINGHAM	We wait upon your grace.

1890	
1891	[Enter the DUCHESS OF YORK, with the two children of CLARENCE]
1892	
1893	Boy	Tell me, good grandam, is our father dead?
1894	
1895	DUCHESS OF YORK	No, boy.
1896	
1897	Boy	Why do you wring your hands, and beat your breast,
1898	And cry 'O Clarence, my unhappy son!'
1899	
1900	Girl	Why do you look on us, and shake your head,
1901	And call us wretches, orphans, castaways
1902	If that our noble father be alive?
1903	
1904	DUCHESS OF YORK	My pretty cousins, you mistake me much;
1905	I do lament the sickness of the king.
1906	As loath to lose him, not your father's death;
1907	It were lost sorrow to wail one that's lost.
1908	
1909	Boy	Then, grandam, you conclude that he is dead.
1910	The king my uncle is to blame for this:
1911	God will revenge it; whom I will importune
1912	With daily prayers all to that effect.
1913	
1914	Girl	And so will I.
1915	
1916	DUCHESS OF YORK	Peace, children, peace! the king doth love you well:
1917	Incapable and shallow innocents,
1918	You cannot guess who caused your father's death.
1919	
1920	Boy	Grandam, we can; for my good uncle Gloucester
1921	Told me, the king, provoked by the queen,
1922	Devised impeachments to imprison him :
1923	And when my uncle told me so, he wept,
1924	And hugg'd me in his arm, and kindly kiss'd my cheek;
1925	Bade me rely on him as on my father,
1926	And he would love me dearly as his child.
1927	
1928	DUCHESS OF YORK	Oh, that deceit should steal such gentle shapes,
1929	And with a virtuous vizard hide foul guile!
1930	He is my son; yea, and therein my shame;
1931	Yet from my dugs he drew not this deceit.
1932	
1933	Boy	Think you my uncle did dissemble, grandam?
1934	
1935	DUCHESS OF YORK	Ay, boy.
1936	
1937	Boy	I cannot think it. Hark! what noise is this?
1938	
1939	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH, with her hair about her
1940	ears; RIVERS, and DORSET after her]
1941	
1942	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Oh, who shall hinder me to wail and weep,
1943	To chide my fortune, and torment myself?
1944	I'll join with black despair against my soul,
1945	And to myself become an enemy.
1946	
1947	DUCHESS OF YORK	What means this scene of rude impatience?
1948	
1949	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To make an act of tragic violence:
1950	Edward, my lord, your son, our king, is dead.
1951	Why grow the branches now the root is wither'd?
1952	Why wither not the leaves the sap being gone?
1953	If you will live, lament; if die, be brief,
1954	That our swift-winged souls may catch the king's;
1955	Or, like obedient subjects, follow him
1956	To his new kingdom of perpetual rest.
1957	
1958	DUCHESS OF YORK	Ah, so much interest have I in thy sorrow
1959	As I had title in thy noble husband!
1960	I have bewept a worthy husband's death,
1961	And lived by looking on his images:
1962	But now two mirrors of his princely semblance
1963	Are crack'd in pieces by malignant death,
1964	And I for comfort have but one false glass,
1965	Which grieves me when I see my shame in him.
1966	Thou art a widow; yet thou art a mother,
1967	And hast the comfort of thy children left thee:
1968	But death hath snatch'd my husband from mine arms,
1969	And pluck'd two crutches from my feeble limbs,
1970	Edward and Clarence. O, what cause have I,
1971	Thine being but a moiety of my grief,
1972	To overgo thy plaints and drown thy cries!
1973	
1974	Boy	Good aunt, you wept not for our father's death;
1975	How can we aid you with our kindred tears?
1976	
1977	Girl	Our fatherless distress was left unmoan'd;
1978	Your widow-dolour likewise be unwept!
1979	
1980	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Give me no help in lamentation;
1981	I am not barren to bring forth complaints
1982	All springs reduce their currents to mine eyes,
1983	That I, being govern'd by the watery moon,
1984	May send forth plenteous tears to drown the world!
1985	Oh for my husband, for my dear lord Edward!
1986	
1987	Children	Oh for our father, for our dear lord Clarence!
1988	
1989	DUCHESS OF YORK	Alas for both, both mine, Edward and Clarence!
1990	
1991	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What stay had I but Edward? and he's gone.
1992	
1993	Children	What stay had we but Clarence? and he's gone.
1994	
1995	DUCHESS OF YORK	What stays had I but they? and they are gone.
1996	
1997	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Was never widow had so dear a loss!
1998	
1999	Children	Were never orphans had so dear a loss!
2000	
2001	DUCHESS OF YORK	Was never mother had so dear a loss!
2002	Alas, I am the mother of these moans!
2003	Their woes are parcell'd, mine are general.
2004	She for an Edward weeps, and so do I;
2005	I for a Clarence weep, so doth not she:
2006	These babes for Clarence weep and so do I;
2007	I for an Edward weep, so do not they:
2008	Alas, you three, on me, threefold distress'd,
2009	Pour all your tears! I am your sorrow's nurse,
2010	And I will pamper it with lamentations.
2011	
2012	DORSET	Comfort, dear mother: God is much displeased
2013	That you take with unthankfulness, his doing:
2014	In common worldly things, 'tis call'd ungrateful,
2015	With dull unwilligness to repay a debt
2016	Which with a bounteous hand was kindly lent;
2017	Much more to be thus opposite with heaven,
2018	For it requires the royal debt it lent you.
2019	
2020	RIVERS	Madam, bethink you, like a careful mother,
2021	Of the young prince your son: send straight for him
2022	Let him be crown'd; in him your comfort lives:
2023	Drown desperate sorrow in dead Edward's grave,
2024	And plant your joys in living Edward's throne.
2025	
2026	[Enter GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, and RATCLIFF]
2027	
2028	GLOUCESTER	Madam, have comfort: all of us have cause
2029	To wail the dimming of our shining star;
2030	But none can cure their harms by wailing them.
2031	Madam, my mother, I do cry you mercy;
2032	I did not see your grace: humbly on my knee
2033	I crave your blessing.
2034	
2035	DUCHESS OF YORK	God bless thee; and put meekness in thy mind,
2036	Love, charity, obedience, and true duty!
2037	
2038	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Amen; and make me die a good old man!
2039	That is the butt-end of a mother's blessing:
2040	I marvel why her grace did leave it out.
2041	
2042	BUCKINGHAM	You cloudy princes and heart-sorrowing peers,
2043	That bear this mutual heavy load of moan,
2044	Now cheer each other in each other's love
2045	Though we have spent our harvest of this king,
2046	We are to reap the harvest of his son.
2047	The broken rancour of your high-swoln hearts,
2048	But lately splinter'd, knit, and join'd together,
2049	Must gently be preserved, cherish'd, and kept:
2050	Me seemeth good, that, with some little train,
2051	Forthwith from Ludlow the young prince be fetch'd
2052	Hither to London, to be crown'd our king.
2053	
2054	RIVERS	Why with some little train, my Lord of Buckingham?
2055	
2056	BUCKINGHAM	Marry, my lord, lest, by a multitude,
2057	The new-heal'd wound of malice should break out,
2058	Which would be so much the more dangerous
2059	By how much the estate is green and yet ungovern'd:
2060	Where every horse bears his commanding rein,
2061	And may direct his course as please himself,
2062	As well the fear of harm, as harm apparent,
2063	In my opinion, ought to be prevented.
2064	
2065	GLOUCESTER	I hope the king made peace with all of us
2066	And the compact is firm and true in me.
2067	
2068	RIVERS	And so in me; and so, I think, in all:
2069	Yet, since it is but green, it should be put
2070	To no apparent likelihood of breach,
2071	Which haply by much company might be urged:
2072	Therefore I say with noble Buckingham,
2073	That it is meet so few should fetch the prince.
2074	
2075	HASTINGS	And so say I.
2076	
2077	GLOUCESTER	Then be it so; and go we to determine
2078	Who they shall be that straight shall post to Ludlow.
2079	Madam, and you, my mother, will you go
2080	To give your censures in this weighty business?
2081

2089	
2090	BUCKINGHAM	My lord, whoever journeys to the Prince,
2091	For God's sake, let not us two be behind;
2092	For, by the way, I'll sort occasion,
2093	As index to the story we late talk'd of,
2094	To part the queen's proud kindred from the king.
2095	
2096	GLOUCESTER	My other self, my counsel's consistory,
2097	My oracle, my prophet! My dear cousin,
2098	I, like a child, will go by thy direction.
2099	Towards Ludlow then, for we'll not stay behind.

2125	Second Citizen	Bad news, by'r lady; seldom comes the better:
2126	I fear, I fear 'twill prove a troublous world.
2127	
2128	[Enter another Citizen]
2129	
2130	Third Citizen	Neighbours, God speed!
2131	
2132	First Citizen	Give you good morrow, sir.
2133	
2134	Third Citizen	Doth this news hold of good King Edward's death?
2135	
2136	Second Citizen	Ay, sir, it is too true; God help the while!
2137	
2138	Third Citizen	Then, masters, look to see a troublous world.
2139	
2140	First Citizen	No, no; by God's good grace his son shall reign.
2141	
2142	Third Citizen	Woe to the land that's govern'd by a child!
2143	
2144	Second Citizen	In him there is a hope of government,
2145	That in his nonage council under him,
2146	And in his full and ripen'd years himself,
2147	No doubt, shall then and till then govern well.
2148	
2149	First Citizen	So stood the state when Henry the Sixth
2150	Was crown'd in Paris but at nine months old.
2151	
2152	Third Citizen	Stood the state so? No, no, good friends, God wot;
2153	For then this land was famously enrich'd
2154	With politic grave counsel; then the king
2155	Had virtuous uncles to protect his grace.
2156	
2157	First Citizen	Why, so hath this, both by the father and mother.
2158	
2159	Third Citizen	Better it were they all came by the father,
2160	Or by the father there were none at all;
2161	For emulation now, who shall be nearest,
2162	Will touch us all too near, if God prevent not.
2163	O, full of danger is the Duke of Gloucester!
2164	And the queen's sons and brothers haught and proud:
2165	And were they to be ruled, and not to rule,
2166	This sickly land might solace as before.
2167	
2168	First Citizen	Come, come, we fear the worst; all shall be well.
2169	
2170	Third Citizen	When clouds appear, wise men put on their cloaks;
2171	When great leaves fall, the winter is at hand;
2172	When the sun sets, who doth not look for night?
2173	Untimely storms make men expect a dearth.
2174	All may be well; but, if God sort it so,
2175	'Tis more than we deserve, or I expect.
2176	
2177	Second Citizen	Truly, the souls of men are full of dread:
2178	Ye cannot reason almost with a man
2179	That looks not heavily and full of fear.
2180	
2181	Third Citizen	Before the times of change, still is it so:
2182	By a divine instinct men's minds mistrust
2183	Ensuing dangers; as by proof, we see
2184	The waters swell before a boisterous storm.
2185	But leave it all to God. whither away?
2186	
2187	Second Citizen	Marry, we were sent for to the justices.
2188	
2189	Third Citizen	And so was I: I'll bear you company.

2204	
2205	
2206	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, young YORK, QUEEN
2207	ELIZABETH, and the DUCHESS OF YORK]
2208	
2209	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Last night, I hear, they lay at Northampton;
2210	At Stony-Stratford will they be to-night:
2211	To-morrow, or next day, they will be here.
2212	
2213	DUCHESS OF YORK	I long with all my heart to see the prince:
2214	I hope he is much grown since last I saw him.
2215	
2216	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But I hear, no; they say my son of York
2217	Hath almost overta'en him in his growth.
2218	
2219	YORK	Ay, mother; but I would not have it so.
2220	
2221	DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, my young cousin, it is good to grow.
2222	
2223	YORK	Grandam, one night, as we did sit at supper,
2224	My uncle Rivers talk'd how I did grow
2225	More than my brother: 'Ay,' quoth my uncle
2226	Gloucester,
2227	'Small herbs have grace, great weeds do grow apace:'
2228	And since, methinks, I would not grow so fast,
2229	Because sweet flowers are slow and weeds make haste.
2230	
2231	DUCHESS OF YORK	Good faith, good faith, the saying did not hold
2232	In him that did object the same to thee;
2233	He was the wretched'st thing when he was young,
2234	So long a-growing and so leisurely,
2235	That, if this rule were true, he should be gracious.
2236	
2237	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Why, madam, so, no doubt, he is.
2238	
2239	DUCHESS OF YORK	I hope he is; but yet let mothers doubt.
2240	
2241	YORK	Now, by my troth, if I had been remember'd,
2242	I could have given my uncle's grace a flout,
2243	To touch his growth nearer than he touch'd mine.
2244	
2245	DUCHESS OF YORK	How, my pretty York? I pray thee, let me hear it.
2246	
2247	YORK	Marry, they say my uncle grew so fast
2248	That he could gnaw a crust at two hours old
2249	'Twas full two years ere I could get a tooth.
2250	Grandam, this would have been a biting jest.
2251	
2252	DUCHESS OF YORK	I pray thee, pretty York, who told thee this?
2253	
2254	YORK	Grandam, his nurse.
2255	
2256	DUCHESS OF YORK	His nurse! why, she was dead ere thou wert born.
2257	
2258	YORK	If 'twere not she, I cannot tell who told me.
2259	
2260	QUEEN ELIZABETH	A parlous boy: go to, you are too shrewd.
2261	
2262	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Good madam, be not angry with the child.
2263	
2264	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Pitchers have ears.
2265	
2266	[Enter a Messenger]
2267	
2268	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Here comes a messenger. What news?
2269	
2270	Messenger	Such news, my lord, as grieves me to unfold.
2271	
2272	QUEEN ELIZABETH	How fares the prince?
2273	
2274	Messenger	Well, madam, and in health.
2275	
2276	DUCHESS OF YORK	What is thy news then?
2277	
2278	Messenger	Lord Rivers and Lord Grey are sent to Pomfret,
2279	With them Sir Thomas Vaughan, prisoners.
2280	
2281	DUCHESS OF YORK	Who hath committed them?
2282	
2283	Messenger	The mighty dukes
2284	Gloucester and Buckingham.
2285	
2286	QUEEN ELIZABETH	For what offence?
2287	
2288	Messenger	The sum of all I can, I have disclosed;
2289	Why or for what these nobles were committed
2290	Is all unknown to me, my gracious lady.
2291	
2292	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ay me, I see the downfall of our house!
2293	The tiger now hath seized the gentle hind;
2294	Insulting tyranny begins to jet
2295	Upon the innocent and aweless throne:
2296	Welcome, destruction, death, and massacre!
2297	I see, as in a map, the end of all.
2298	
2299	DUCHESS OF YORK	Accursed and unquiet wrangling days,
2300	How many of you have mine eyes beheld!
2301	My husband lost his life to get the crown;
2302	And often up and down my sons were toss'd,
2303	For me to joy and weep their gain and loss:
2304	And being seated, and domestic broils
2305	Clean over-blown, themselves, the conquerors.
2306	Make war upon themselves; blood against blood,
2307	Self against self: O, preposterous
2308	And frantic outrage, end thy damned spleen;
2309	Or let me die, to look on death no more!
2310	
2311	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Come, come, my boy; we will to sanctuary.
2312	Madam, farewell.
2313	
2314	DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I'll go along with you.
2315	
2316	QUEEN ELIZABETH	You have no cause.
2317	
2318	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	                  My gracious lady, go;
2319	And thither bear your treasure and your goods.
2320	For my part, I'll resign unto your grace
2321	The seal I keep: and so betide to me
2322	As well I tender you and all of yours!
2323	Come, I'll conduct you to the sanctuary.

2335	
2336	
2337	SCENE I	London. A street.
2338	
2339	
2340	[The trumpets sound. Enter the young PRINCE EDWARD,
2341	GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM, CARDINAL, CATESBY, and others]
2342	
2343	BUCKINGHAM	Welcome, sweet prince, to London, to your chamber.
2344	
2345	GLOUCESTER	Welcome, dear cousin, my thoughts' sovereign
2346	The weary way hath made you melancholy.
2347	
2348	PRINCE EDWARD	No, uncle; but our crosses on the way
2349	Have made it tedious, wearisome, and heavy
2350	I want more uncles here to welcome me.
2351	
2352	GLOUCESTER	Sweet prince, the untainted virtue of your years
2353	Hath not yet dived into the world's deceit
2354	Nor more can you distinguish of a man
2355	Than of his outward show; which, God he knows,
2356	Seldom or never jumpeth with the heart.
2357	Those uncles which you want were dangerous;
2358	Your grace attended to their sugar'd words,
2359	But look'd not on the poison of their hearts :
2360	God keep you from them, and from such false friends!
2361	
2362	PRINCE EDWARD	God keep me from false friends! but they were none.
2363	
2364	GLOUCESTER	My lord, the mayor of London comes to greet you.
2365	
2366	[Enter the Lord Mayor and his train]
2367	
2368	Lord Mayor	God bless your grace with health and happy days!
2369	
2370	PRINCE EDWARD	I thank you, good my lord; and thank you all.
2371	I thought my mother, and my brother York,
2372	Would long ere this have met us on the way
2373	Fie, what a slug is Hastings, that he comes not
2374	To tell us whether they will come or no!
2375	
2376	[Enter HASTINGS]
2377	
2378	BUCKINGHAM	And, in good time, here comes the sweating lord.
2379	
2380	PRINCE EDWARD	Welcome, my lord: what, will our mother come?
2381	
2382	HASTINGS	On what occasion, God he knows, not I,
2383	The queen your mother, and your brother York,
2384	Have taken sanctuary: the tender prince
2385	Would fain have come with me to meet your grace,
2386	But by his mother was perforce withheld.
2387	
2388	BUCKINGHAM	Fie, what an indirect and peevish course
2389	Is this of hers! Lord cardinal, will your grace
2390	Persuade the queen to send the Duke of York
2391	Unto his princely brother presently?
2392	If she deny, Lord Hastings, go with him,
2393	And from her jealous arms pluck him perforce.
2394	
2395	CARDINAL	My Lord of Buckingham, if my weak oratory
2396	Can from his mother win the Duke of York,
2397	Anon expect him here; but if she be obdurate
2398	To mild entreaties, God in heaven forbid
2399	We should infringe the holy privilege
2400	Of blessed sanctuary! not for all this land
2401	Would I be guilty of so deep a sin.
2402	
2403	BUCKINGHAM	You are too senseless--obstinate, my lord,
2404	Too ceremonious and traditional
2405	Weigh it but with the grossness of this age,
2406	You break not sanctuary in seizing him.
2407	The benefit thereof is always granted
2408	To those whose dealings have deserved the place,
2409	And those who have the wit to claim the place:
2410	This prince hath neither claim'd it nor deserved it;
2411	And therefore, in mine opinion, cannot have it:
2412	Then, taking him from thence that is not there,
2413	You break no privilege nor charter there.
2414	Oft have I heard of sanctuary men;
2415	But sanctuary children ne'er till now.
2416	
2417	CARDINAL	My lord, you shall o'er-rule my mind for once.
2418	Come on, Lord Hastings, will you go with me?
2419	
2420	HASTINGS	I go, my lord.
2421	
2422	PRINCE EDWARD	Good lords, make all the speedy haste you may.
2423	
2424	[Exeunt CARDINAL and HASTINGS]
2425	
2426	Say, uncle Gloucester, if our brother come,
2427	Where shall we sojourn till our coronation?
2428	
2429	GLOUCESTER	Where it seems best unto your royal self.
2430	If I may counsel you, some day or two
2431	Your highness shall repose you at the Tower:
2432	Then where you please, and shall be thought most fit
2433	For your best health and recreation.
2434	
2435	PRINCE EDWARD	I do not like the Tower, of any place.
2436	Did Julius Caesar build that place, my lord?
2437	
2438	BUCKINGHAM	He did, my gracious lord, begin that place;
2439	Which, since, succeeding ages have re-edified.
2440	
2441	PRINCE EDWARD	Is it upon record, or else reported
2442	Successively from age to age, he built it?
2443	
2444	BUCKINGHAM	Upon record, my gracious lord.
2445	
2446	PRINCE EDWARD	But say, my lord, it were not register'd,
2447	Methinks the truth should live from age to age,
2448	As 'twere retail'd to all posterity,
2449	Even to the general all-ending day.
2450	
2451	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  So wise so young, they say, do never
2452	live long.
2453	
2454	PRINCE EDWARD	What say you, uncle?
2455	
2456	GLOUCESTER	I say, without characters, fame lives long.
2457	
2458	[Aside]
2459	
2460	Thus, like the formal vice, Iniquity,
2461	I moralize two meanings in one word.
2462	
2463	PRINCE EDWARD	That Julius Caesar was a famous man;
2464	With what his valour did enrich his wit,
2465	His wit set down to make his valour live
2466	Death makes no conquest of this conqueror;
2467	For now he lives in fame, though not in life.
2468	I'll tell you what, my cousin Buckingham,--
2469	
2470	BUCKINGHAM	What, my gracious lord?
2471	
2472	PRINCE EDWARD	An if I live until I be a man,
2473	I'll win our ancient right in France again,
2474	Or die a soldier, as I lived a king.
2475	
2476	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Short summers lightly have a forward spring.
2477	
2478	[Enter young YORK, HASTINGS, and the CARDINAL]
2479	
2480	BUCKINGHAM	Now, in good time, here comes the Duke of York.
2481	
2482	PRINCE EDWARD	Richard of York! how fares our loving brother?
2483	
2484	YORK	Well, my dread lord; so must I call you now.
2485	
2486	PRINCE EDWARD	Ay, brother, to our grief, as it is yours:
2487	Too late he died that might have kept that title,
2488	Which by his death hath lost much majesty.
2489	
2490	GLOUCESTER	How fares our cousin, noble Lord of York?
2491	
2492	YORK	I thank you, gentle uncle. O, my lord,
2493	You said that idle weeds are fast in growth
2494	The prince my brother hath outgrown me far.
2495	
2496	GLOUCESTER	He hath, my lord.
2497	
2498	YORK	                  And therefore is he idle?
2499	
2500	GLOUCESTER	O, my fair cousin, I must not say so.
2501	
2502	YORK	Then is he more beholding to you than I.
2503	
2504	GLOUCESTER	He may command me as my sovereign;
2505	But you have power in me as in a kinsman.
2506	
2507	YORK	I pray you, uncle, give me this dagger.
2508	
2509	GLOUCESTER	My dagger, little cousin? with all my heart.
2510	
2511	PRINCE EDWARD	A beggar, brother?
2512	
2513	YORK	Of my kind uncle, that I know will give;
2514	And being but a toy, which is no grief to give.
2515	
2516	GLOUCESTER	A greater gift than that I'll give my cousin.
2517	
2518	YORK	A greater gift! O, that's the sword to it.
2519	
2520	GLOUCESTER	A gentle cousin, were it light enough.
2521	
2522	YORK	O, then, I see, you will part but with light gifts;
2523	In weightier things you'll say a beggar nay.
2524	
2525	GLOUCESTER	It is too heavy for your grace to wear.
2526	
2527	YORK	I weigh it lightly, were it heavier.
2528	
2529	GLOUCESTER	What, would you have my weapon, little lord?
2530	
2531	YORK	I would, that I might thank you as you call me.
2532	
2533	GLOUCESTER	How?
2534	
2535	YORK	Little.
2536	
2537	PRINCE EDWARD	My Lord of York will still be cross in talk:
2538	Uncle, your grace knows how to bear with him.
2539	
2540	YORK	You mean, to bear me, not to bear with me:
2541	Uncle, my brother mocks both you and me;
2542	Because that I am little, like an ape,
2543	He thinks that you should bear me on your shoulders.
2544	
2545	BUCKINGHAM	With what a sharp-provided wit he reasons!
2546	To mitigate the scorn he gives his uncle,
2547	He prettily and aptly taunts himself:
2548	So cunning and so young is wonderful.
2549	
2550	GLOUCESTER	My lord, will't please you pass along?
2551	Myself and my good cousin Buckingham
2552	Will to your mother, to entreat of her
2553	To meet you at the Tower and welcome you.
2554	
2555	YORK	What, will you go unto the Tower, my lord?
2556	
2557	PRINCE EDWARD	My lord protector needs will have it so.
2558	
2559	YORK	I shall not sleep in quiet at the Tower.
2560	
2561	GLOUCESTER	Why, what should you fear?
2562	
2563	YORK	Marry, my uncle Clarence' angry ghost:
2564	My grandam told me he was murdered there.
2565	
2566	PRINCE EDWARD	I fear no uncles dead.
2567	
2568	GLOUCESTER	Nor none that live, I hope.
2569	
2570	PRINCE EDWARD	An if they live, I hope I need not fear.
2571	But come, my lord; and with a heavy heart,
2572	Thinking on them, go I unto the Tower.
2573	
2574	[A Sennet. Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM
2575	and CATESBY]
2576	
2577	BUCKINGHAM	Think you, my lord, this little prating York
2578	Was not incensed by his subtle mother
2579	To taunt and scorn you thus opprobriously?
2580	
2581	GLOUCESTER	No doubt, no doubt; O, 'tis a parlous boy;
2582	Bold, quick, ingenious, forward, capable
2583	He is all the mother's, from the top to toe.
2584	
2585	BUCKINGHAM	Well, let them rest. Come hither, Catesby.
2586	Thou art sworn as deeply to effect what we intend
2587	As closely to conceal what we impart:
2588	Thou know'st our reasons urged upon the way;
2589	What think'st thou? is it not an easy matter
2590	To make William Lord Hastings of our mind,
2591	For the instalment of this noble duke
2592	In the seat royal of this famous isle?
2593	
2594	CATESBY	He for his father's sake so loves the prince,
2595	That he will not be won to aught against him.
2596	
2597	BUCKINGHAM	What think'st thou, then, of Stanley? what will he?
2598	
2599	CATESBY	He will do all in all as Hastings doth.
2600	
2601	BUCKINGHAM	Well, then, no more but this: go, gentle Catesby,
2602	And, as it were far off sound thou Lord Hastings,
2603	How doth he stand affected to our purpose;
2604	And summon him to-morrow to the Tower,
2605	To sit about the coronation.
2606	If thou dost find him tractable to us,
2607	Encourage him, and show him all our reasons:
2608	If he be leaden, icy-cold, unwilling,
2609	Be thou so too; and so break off your talk,
2610	And give us notice of his inclination:
2611	For we to-morrow hold divided councils,
2612	Wherein thyself shalt highly be employ'd.
2613	
2614	GLOUCESTER	Commend me to Lord William: tell him, Catesby,
2615	His ancient knot of dangerous adversaries
2616	To-morrow are let blood at Pomfret-castle;
2617	And bid my friend, for joy of this good news,
2618	Give mistress Shore one gentle kiss the more.
2619	
2620	BUCKINGHAM	Good Catesby, go, effect this business soundly.
2621	
2622	CATESBY	My good lords both, with all the heed I may.
2623	
2624	GLOUCESTER	Shall we hear from you, Catesby, ere we sleep?
2625	
2626	CATESBY	You shall, my lord.
2627	
2628	GLOUCESTER	At Crosby Place, there shall you find us both.
2629	
2630	[Exit CATESBY]
2631	
2632	BUCKINGHAM	Now, my lord, what shall we do, if we perceive
2633	Lord Hastings will not yield to our complots?
2634	
2635	GLOUCESTER	Chop off his head, man; somewhat we will do:
2636	And, look, when I am king, claim thou of me
2637	The earldom of Hereford, and the moveables
2638	Whereof the king my brother stood possess'd.
2639	
2640	BUCKINGHAM	I'll claim that promise at your grace's hands.
2641	
2642	GLOUCESTER	And look to have it yielded with all willingness.
2643	Come, let us sup betimes, that afterwards
2644	We may digest our complots in some form.

2652	
2653	
2654	ACT III
2655	
2656	
2657	
2658	SCENE II	Before Lord Hastings' house.
2659	
2660	
2661	[Enter a Messenger]
2662	
2663	Messenger	What, ho! my lord!
2664	
2665	HASTINGS	[Within]  Who knocks at the door?
2666	
2667	Messenger	A messenger from the Lord Stanley.
2668	
2669	[Enter HASTINGS]
2670	
2671	HASTINGS	What is't o'clock?
2672	
2673	Messenger	Upon the stroke of four.
2674	
2675	HASTINGS	Cannot thy master sleep these tedious nights?
2676	
2677	Messenger	So it should seem by that I have to say.
2678	First, he commends him to your noble lordship.
2679	
2680	HASTINGS	And then?
2681	
2682	Messenger	And then he sends you word
2683	He dreamt to-night the boar had razed his helm:
2684	Besides, he says there are two councils held;
2685	And that may be determined at the one
2686	which may make you and him to rue at the other.
2687	Therefore he sends to know your lordship's pleasure,
2688	If presently you will take horse with him,
2689	And with all speed post with him toward the north,
2690	To shun the danger that his soul divines.
2691	
2692	HASTINGS	Go, fellow, go, return unto thy lord;
2693	Bid him not fear the separated councils
2694	His honour and myself are at the one,
2695	And at the other is my servant Catesby
2696	Where nothing can proceed that toucheth us
2697	Whereof I shall not have intelligence.
2698	Tell him his fears are shallow, wanting instance:
2699	And for his dreams, I wonder he is so fond
2700	To trust the mockery of unquiet slumbers
2701	To fly the boar before the boar pursues,
2702	Were to incense the boar to follow us
2703	And make pursuit where he did mean no chase.
2704	Go, bid thy master rise and come to me
2705	And we will both together to the Tower,
2706	Where, he shall see, the boar will use us kindly.
2707	
2708	Messenger	My gracious lord, I'll tell him what you say.
2709	
2710	[Exit]
2711	
2712	[Enter CATESBY]
2713	
2714	CATESBY	Many good morrows to my noble lord!
2715	
2716	HASTINGS	Good morrow, Catesby; you are early stirring
2717	What news, what news, in this our tottering state?
2718	
2719	CATESBY	It is a reeling world, indeed, my lord;
2720	And I believe twill never stand upright
2721	Tim Richard wear the garland of the realm.
2722	
2723	HASTINGS	How! wear the garland! dost thou mean the crown?
2724	
2725	CATESBY	Ay, my good lord.
2726	
2727	HASTINGS	I'll have this crown of mine cut from my shoulders
2728	Ere I will see the crown so foul misplaced.
2729	But canst thou guess that he doth aim at it?
2730	
2731	CATESBY	Ay, on my life; and hopes to find forward
2732	Upon his party for the gain thereof:
2733	And thereupon he sends you this good news,
2734	That this same very day your enemies,
2735	The kindred of the queen, must die at Pomfret.
2736	
2737	HASTINGS	Indeed, I am no mourner for that news,
2738	Because they have been still mine enemies:
2739	But, that I'll give my voice on Richard's side,
2740	To bar my master's heirs in true descent,
2741	God knows I will not do it, to the death.
2742	
2743	CATESBY	God keep your lordship in that gracious mind!
2744	
2745	HASTINGS	But I shall laugh at this a twelve-month hence,
2746	That they who brought me in my master's hate
2747	I live to look upon their tragedy.
2748	I tell thee, Catesby--
2749	
2750	CATESBY	What, my lord?
2751	
2752	HASTINGS	Ere a fortnight make me elder,
2753	I'll send some packing that yet think not on it.
2754	
2755	CATESBY	'Tis a vile thing to die, my gracious lord,
2756	When men are unprepared and look not for it.
2757	
2758	HASTINGS	O monstrous, monstrous! and so falls it out
2759	With Rivers, Vaughan, Grey: and so 'twill do
2760	With some men else, who think themselves as safe
2761	As thou and I; who, as thou know'st, are dear
2762	To princely Richard and to Buckingham.
2763	
2764	CATESBY	The princes both make high account of you;
2765	
2766	[Aside]
2767	
2768	For they account his head upon the bridge.
2769	
2770	HASTINGS	I know they do; and I have well deserved it.
2771	
2772	[Enter STANLEY]
2773	
2774	Come on, come on; where is your boar-spear, man?
2775	Fear you the boar, and go so unprovided?
2776	
2777	STANLEY	My lord, good morrow; good morrow, Catesby:
2778	You may jest on, but, by the holy rood,
2779	I do not like these several councils, I.
2780	
2781	HASTINGS	My lord,
2782	I hold my life as dear as you do yours;
2783	And never in my life, I do protest,
2784	Was it more precious to me than 'tis now:
2785	Think you, but that I know our state secure,
2786	I would be so triumphant as I am?
2787	
2788	STANLEY	The lords at Pomfret, when they rode from London,
2789	Were jocund, and supposed their state was sure,
2790	And they indeed had no cause to mistrust;
2791	But yet, you see how soon the day o'ercast.
2792	This sudden stag of rancour I misdoubt:
2793	Pray God, I say, I prove a needless coward!
2794	What, shall we toward the Tower? the day is spent.
2795	
2796	HASTINGS	Come, come, have with you. Wot you what, my lord?
2797	To-day the lords you talk of are beheaded.
2798	
2799	LORD STANLEY	They, for their truth, might better wear their heads
2800	Than some that have accused them wear their hats.
2801	But come, my lord, let us away.
2802	
2803	[Enter a Pursuivant]
2804	
2805	HASTINGS	Go on before; I'll talk with this good fellow.
2806	
2807	[Exeunt STANLEY and CATESBY]
2808	
2809	How now, sirrah! how goes the world with thee?
2810	
2811	Pursuivant	The better that your lordship please to ask.
2812	
2813	HASTINGS	I tell thee, man, 'tis better with me now
2814	Than when I met thee last where now we meet:
2815	Then was I going prisoner to the Tower,
2816	By the suggestion of the queen's allies;
2817	But now, I tell thee--keep it to thyself--
2818	This day those enemies are put to death,
2819	And I in better state than e'er I was.
2820	
2821	Pursuivant	God hold it, to your honour's good content!
2822	
2823	HASTINGS	Gramercy, fellow: there, drink that for me.
2824	
2825	[Throws him his purse]
2826	
2827	Pursuivant	God save your lordship!
2828	
2829	[Exit]
2830	
2831	[Enter a Priest]
2832	
2833	Priest	Well met, my lord; I am glad to see your honour.
2834	
2835	HASTINGS	I thank thee, good Sir John, with all my heart.
2836	I am in your debt for your last exercise;
2837	Come the next Sabbath, and I will content you.
2838	
2839	[He whispers in his ear]
2840	
2841	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]
2842	
2843	BUCKINGHAM	What, talking with a priest, lord chamberlain?
2844	Your friends at Pomfret, they do need the priest;
2845	Your honour hath no shriving work in hand.
2846	
2847	HASTINGS	Good faith, and when I met this holy man,
2848	Those men you talk of came into my mind.
2849	What, go you toward the Tower?
2850	
2851	BUCKINGHAM	I do, my lord; but long I shall not stay
2852	I shall return before your lordship thence.
2853	
2854	HASTINGS	'Tis like enough, for I stay dinner there.
2855	
2856	BUCKINGHAM	[Aside]  And supper too, although thou know'st it not.
2857	Come, will you go?
2858	
2859	HASTINGS	I'll wait upon your lordship.
2860	
2861	[Exeunt]

2872	
2873	SCENE III	Pomfret Castle.
2874	
2875	
2876	[Enter RATCLIFF, with halberds, carrying RIVERS,
2877	GREY, and VAUGHAN to death]
2878	
2879	RATCLIFF	Come, bring forth the prisoners.
2880	
2881	RIVERS	Sir Richard Ratcliff, let me tell thee this:
2882	To-day shalt thou behold a subject die
2883	For truth, for duty, and for loyalty.
2884	
2885	GREY	God keep the prince from all the pack of you!
2886	A knot you are of damned blood-suckers!
2887	
2888	VAUGHAN	You live that shall cry woe for this after.
2889	
2890	RATCLIFF	Dispatch; the limit of your lives is out.
2891	
2892	RIVERS	O Pomfret, Pomfret! O thou bloody prison,
2893	Fatal and ominous to noble peers!
2894	Within the guilty closure of thy walls
2895	Richard the second here was hack'd to death;
2896	And, for more slander to thy dismal seat,
2897	We give thee up our guiltless blood to drink.
2898	
2899	GREY	Now Margaret's curse is fall'n upon our heads,
2900	For standing by when Richard stabb'd her son.
2901	
2902	RIVERS	Then cursed she Hastings, then cursed she Buckingham,
2903	Then cursed she Richard. O, remember, God
2904	To hear her prayers for them, as now for us
2905	And for my sister and her princely sons,
2906	Be satisfied, dear God, with our true blood,
2907	Which, as thou know'st, unjustly must be spilt.
2908	
2909	RATCLIFF	Make haste; the hour of death is expiate.
2910	
2911	RIVERS	Come, Grey, come, Vaughan, let us all embrace:
2912	And take our leave, until we meet in heaven.

2925	
2926	SCENE IV	The Tower of London.
2927	
2928	
2929	[Enter BUCKINGHAM, DERBY, HASTINGS, the BISHOP OF
2930	ELY, RATCLIFF, LOVEL, with others, and take their
2931	seats at a table]
2932	
2933	HASTINGS	My lords, at once: the cause why we are met
2934	Is, to determine of the coronation.
2935	In God's name, speak: when is the royal day?
2936	
2937	BUCKINGHAM	Are all things fitting for that royal time?
2938	
2939	DERBY	It is, and wants but nomination.
2940	
2941	BISHOP OF ELY	To-morrow, then, I judge a happy day.
2942	
2943	BUCKINGHAM	Who knows the lord protector's mind herein?
2944	Who is most inward with the royal duke?
2945	
2946	BISHOP OF ELY	Your grace, we think, should soonest know his mind.
2947	
2948	BUCKINGHAM	Who, I, my lord I we know each other's faces,
2949	But for our hearts, he knows no more of mine,
2950	Than I of yours;
2951	Nor I no more of his, than you of mine.
2952	Lord Hastings, you and he are near in love.
2953	
2954	HASTINGS	I thank his grace, I know he loves me well;
2955	But, for his purpose in the coronation.
2956	I have not sounded him, nor he deliver'd
2957	His gracious pleasure any way therein:
2958	But you, my noble lords, may name the time;
2959	And in the duke's behalf I'll give my voice,
2960	Which, I presume, he'll take in gentle part.
2961	
2962	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
2963	
2964	BISHOP OF ELY	Now in good time, here comes the duke himself.
2965	
2966	GLOUCESTER	My noble lords and cousins all, good morrow.
2967	I have been long a sleeper; but, I hope,
2968	My absence doth neglect no great designs,
2969	Which by my presence might have been concluded.
2970	
2971	BUCKINGHAM	Had not you come upon your cue, my lord
2972	William Lord Hastings had pronounced your part,--
2973	I mean, your voice,--for crowning of the king.
2974	
2975	GLOUCESTER	Than my Lord Hastings no man might be bolder;
2976	His lordship knows me well, and loves me well.
2977	
2978	HASTINGS	I thank your grace.
2979	
2980	GLOUCESTER	My lord of Ely!
2981	
2982	BISHOP OF ELY	My lord?
2983	
2984	GLOUCESTER	When I was last in Holborn,
2985	I saw good strawberries in your garden there
2986	I do beseech you send for some of them.
2987	
2988	BISHOP OF ELY	Marry, and will, my lord, with all my heart.
2989	
2990	[Exit]
2991	
2992	GLOUCESTER	Cousin of Buckingham, a word with you.
2993	
2994	[Drawing him aside]
2995	
2996	Catesby hath sounded Hastings in our business,
2997	And finds the testy gentleman so hot,
2998	As he will lose his head ere give consent
2999	His master's son, as worshipful as he terms it,
3000	Shall lose the royalty of England's throne.
3001	
3002	BUCKINGHAM	Withdraw you hence, my lord, I'll follow you.
3003	
3004	[Exit GLOUCESTER, BUCKINGHAM following]
3005	
3006	DERBY	We have not yet set down this day of triumph.
3007	To-morrow, in mine opinion, is too sudden;
3008	For I myself am not so well provided
3009	As else I would be, were the day prolong'd.
3010	
3011	[Re-enter BISHOP OF ELY]
3012	
3013	BISHOP OF ELY	Where is my lord protector? I have sent for these
3014	strawberries.
3015	
3016	HASTINGS	His grace looks cheerfully and smooth to-day;
3017	There's some conceit or other likes him well,
3018	When he doth bid good morrow with such a spirit.
3019	I think there's never a man in Christendom
3020	That can less hide his love or hate than he;
3021	For by his face straight shall you know his heart.
3022	
3023	DERBY	What of his heart perceive you in his face
3024	By any likelihood he show'd to-day?
3025	
3026	HASTINGS	Marry, that with no man here he is offended;
3027	For, were he, he had shown it in his looks.
3028	
3029	DERBY	I pray God he be not, I say.
3030	
3031	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM]
3032	
3033	GLOUCESTER	I pray you all, tell me what they deserve
3034	That do conspire my death with devilish plots
3035	Of damned witchcraft, and that have prevail'd
3036	Upon my body with their hellish charms?
3037	
3038	HASTINGS	The tender love I bear your grace, my lord,
3039	Makes me most forward in this noble presence
3040	To doom the offenders, whatsoever they be
3041	I say, my lord, they have deserved death.
3042	
3043	GLOUCESTER	Then be your eyes the witness of this ill:
3044	See how I am bewitch'd; behold mine arm
3045	Is, like a blasted sapling, wither'd up:
3046	And this is Edward's wife, that monstrous witch,
3047	Consorted with that harlot strumpet Shore,
3048	That by their witchcraft thus have marked me.
3049	
3050	HASTINGS	If they have done this thing, my gracious lord--
3051	
3052	GLOUCESTER	If I thou protector of this damned strumpet--
3053	Tellest thou me of 'ifs'?  Thou art a traitor:
3054	Off with his head! Now, by Saint Paul I swear,
3055	I will not dine until I see the same.
3056	Lovel and Ratcliff, look that it be done:
3057	The rest, that love me, rise and follow me.
3058	
3059	[Exeunt all but HASTINGS, RATCLIFF, and LOVEL]
3060	
3061	HASTINGS	Woe, woe for England! not a whit for me;
3062	For I, too fond, might have prevented this.
3063	Stanley did dream the boar did raze his helm;
3064	But I disdain'd it, and did scorn to fly:
3065	Three times to-day my foot-cloth horse did stumble,
3066	And startled, when he look'd upon the Tower,
3067	As loath to bear me to the slaughter-house.
3068	O, now I want the priest that spake to me:
3069	I now repent I told the pursuivant
3070	As 'twere triumphing at mine enemies,
3071	How they at Pomfret bloodily were butcher'd,
3072	And I myself secure in grace and favour.
3073	O Margaret, Margaret, now thy heavy curse
3074	Is lighted on poor Hastings' wretched head!
3075	
3076	RATCLIFF	Dispatch, my lord; the duke would be at dinner:
3077	Make a short shrift; he longs to see your head.
3078	
3079	HASTINGS	O momentary grace of mortal men,
3080	Which we more hunt for than the grace of God!
3081	Who builds his hopes in air of your good looks,
3082	Lives like a drunken sailor on a mast,
3083	Ready, with every nod, to tumble down
3084	Into the fatal bowels of the deep.
3085	
3086	LOVEL	Come, come, dispatch; 'tis bootless to exclaim.
3087	
3088	HASTINGS	O bloody Richard! miserable England!
3089	I prophesy the fearful'st time to thee
3090	That ever wretched age hath look'd upon.
3091	Come, lead me to the block; bear him my head.
3092	They smile at me that shortly shall be dead.

3105	
3106	SCENE V	The Tower-walls.
3107	
3108	
3109	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, in rotten armour,
3110	marvellous ill-favoured]
3111	
3112	GLOUCESTER	Come, cousin, canst thou quake, and change thy colour,
3113	Murder thy breath in the middle of a word,
3114	And then begin again, and stop again,
3115	As if thou wert distraught and mad with terror?
3116	
3117	BUCKINGHAM	Tut, I can counterfeit the deep tragedian;
3118	Speak and look back, and pry on every side,
3119	Tremble and start at wagging of a straw,
3120	Intending deep suspicion: ghastly looks
3121	Are at my service, like enforced smiles;
3122	And both are ready in their offices,
3123	At any time, to grace my stratagems.
3124	But what, is Catesby gone?
3125	
3126	GLOUCESTER	He is; and, see, he brings the mayor along.
3127	
3128	[Enter the Lord Mayor and CATESBY]
3129	
3130	BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor,--
3131	
3132	GLOUCESTER	Look to the drawbridge there!
3133	
3134	BUCKINGHAM	Hark! a drum.
3135	
3136	GLOUCESTER	Catesby, o'erlook the walls.
3137	
3138	BUCKINGHAM	Lord mayor, the reason we have sent--
3139	
3140	GLOUCESTER	Look back, defend thee, here are enemies.
3141	
3142	BUCKINGHAM	God and our innocency defend and guard us!
3143	
3144	GLOUCESTER	Be patient, they are friends, Ratcliff and Lovel.
3145	
3146	[Enter LOVEL and RATCLIFF, with HASTINGS' head]
3147	
3148	LOVEL	Here is the head of that ignoble traitor,
3149	The dangerous and unsuspected Hastings.
3150	
3151	GLOUCESTER	So dear I loved the man, that I must weep.
3152	I took him for the plainest harmless creature
3153	That breathed upon this earth a Christian;
3154	Made him my book wherein my soul recorded
3155	The history of all her secret thoughts:
3156	So smooth he daub'd his vice with show of virtue,
3157	That, his apparent open guilt omitted,
3158	I mean, his conversation with Shore's wife,
3159	He lived from all attainder of suspect.
3160	
3161	BUCKINGHAM	Well, well, he was the covert'st shelter'd traitor
3162	That ever lived.
3163	Would you imagine, or almost believe,
3164	Were't not that, by great preservation,
3165	We live to tell it you, the subtle traitor
3166	This day had plotted, in the council-house
3167	To murder me and my good Lord of Gloucester?
3168	
3169	Lord Mayor	What, had he so?
3170	
3171	GLOUCESTER	What, think You we are Turks or infidels?
3172	Or that we would, against the form of law,
3173	Proceed thus rashly to the villain's death,
3174	But that the extreme peril of the case,
3175	The peace of England and our persons' safety,
3176	Enforced us to this execution?
3177	
3178	Lord Mayor	Now, fair befall you! he deserved his death;
3179	And you my good lords, both have well proceeded,
3180	To warn false traitors from the like attempts.
3181	I never look'd for better at his hands,
3182	After he once fell in with Mistress Shore.
3183	
3184	GLOUCESTER	Yet had not we determined he should die,
3185	Until your lordship came to see his death;
3186	Which now the loving haste of these our friends,
3187	Somewhat against our meaning, have prevented:
3188	Because, my lord, we would have had you heard
3189	The traitor speak, and timorously confess
3190	The manner and the purpose of his treason;
3191	That you might well have signified the same
3192	Unto the citizens, who haply may
3193	Misconstrue us in him and wail his death.
3194	
3195	Lord Mayor	But, my good lord, your grace's word shall serve,
3196	As well as I had seen and heard him speak
3197	And doubt you not, right noble princes both,
3198	But I'll acquaint our duteous citizens
3199	With all your just proceedings in this cause.
3200	
3201	GLOUCESTER	And to that end we wish'd your lord-ship here,
3202	To avoid the carping censures of the world.
3203	
3204	BUCKINGHAM	But since you come too late of our intents,
3205	Yet witness what you hear we did intend:
3206	And so, my good lord mayor, we bid farewell.
3207	
3208	[Exit Lord Mayor]
3209	
3210	GLOUCESTER	Go, after, after, cousin Buckingham.
3211	The mayor towards Guildhall hies him in all post:
3212	There, at your meet'st advantage of the time,
3213	Infer the bastardy of Edward's children:
3214	Tell them how Edward put to death a citizen,
3215	Only for saying he would make his son
3216	Heir to the crown; meaning indeed his house,
3217	Which, by the sign thereof was termed so.
3218	Moreover, urge his hateful luxury
3219	And bestial appetite in change of lust;
3220	Which stretched to their servants, daughters, wives,
3221	Even where his lustful eye or savage heart,
3222	Without control, listed to make his prey.
3223	Nay, for a need, thus far come near my person:
3224	Tell them, when that my mother went with child
3225	Of that unsatiate Edward, noble York
3226	My princely father then had wars in France
3227	And, by just computation of the time,
3228	Found that the issue was not his begot;
3229	Which well appeared in his lineaments,
3230	Being nothing like the noble duke my father:
3231	But touch this sparingly, as 'twere far off,
3232	Because you know, my lord, my mother lives.
3233	
3234	BUCKINGHAM	Fear not, my lord, I'll play the orator
3235	As if the golden fee for which I plead
3236	Were for myself: and so, my lord, adieu.
3237	
3238	GLOUCESTER	If you thrive well, bring them to Baynard's Castle;
3239	Where you shall find me well accompanied
3240	With reverend fathers and well-learned bishops.
3241	
3242	BUCKINGHAM	I go: and towards three or four o'clock
3243	Look for the news that the Guildhall affords.
3244	
3245	[Exit BUCKINGHAM]
3246	
3247	GLOUCESTER	Go, Lovel, with all speed to Doctor Shaw;
3248	
3249	[To CATESBY]
3250	
3251	Go thou to Friar Penker; bid them both
3252	Meet me within this hour at Baynard's Castle.
3253	
3254	[Exeunt all but GLOUCESTER]
3255	
3256	Now will I in, to take some privy order,
3257	To draw the brats of Clarence out of sight;
3258	And to give notice, that no manner of person
3259	At any time have recourse unto the princes.
3260

3273	SCENE VI	The same.
3274	
3275	
3276	[Enter a Scrivener, with a paper in his hand]
3277	
3278	Scrivener	This is the indictment of the good Lord Hastings;
3279	Which in a set hand fairly is engross'd,
3280	That it may be this day read over in Paul's.
3281	And mark how well the sequel hangs together:
3282	Eleven hours I spent to write it over,
3283	For yesternight by Catesby was it brought me;
3284	The precedent was full as long a-doing:
3285	And yet within these five hours lived Lord Hastings,
3286	Untainted, unexamined, free, at liberty
3287	Here's a good world the while! Why who's so gross,
3288	That seeth not this palpable device?
3289	Yet who's so blind, but says he sees it not?
3290	Bad is the world; and all will come to nought,
3291	When such bad dealings must be seen in thought.

3304	
3305	SCENE VII	Baynard's Castle.
3306	
3307	
3308	[Enter GLOUCESTER and BUCKINGHAM, at several doors]
3309	
3310	GLOUCESTER	How now, my lord, what say the citizens?
3311	
3312	BUCKINGHAM	Now, by the holy mother of our Lord,
3313	The citizens are mum and speak not a word.
3314	
3315	GLOUCESTER	Touch'd you the bastardy of Edward's children?
3316	
3317	BUCKINGHAM	I did; with his contract with Lady Lucy,
3318	And his contract by deputy in France;
3319	The insatiate greediness of his desires,
3320	And his enforcement of the city wives;
3321	His tyranny for trifles; his own bastardy,
3322	As being got, your father then in France,
3323	His resemblance, being not like the duke;
3324	Withal I did infer your lineaments,
3325	Being the right idea of your father,
3326	Both in your form and nobleness of mind;
3327	Laid open all your victories in Scotland,
3328	Your dicipline in war, wisdom in peace,
3329	Your bounty, virtue, fair humility:
3330	Indeed, left nothing fitting for the purpose
3331	Untouch'd, or slightly handled, in discourse
3332	And when mine oratory grew to an end
3333	I bid them that did love their country's good
3334	Cry 'God save Richard, England's royal king!'
3335	
3336	GLOUCESTER	Ah! and did they so?
3337	
3338	BUCKINGHAM	No, so God help me, they spake not a word;
3339	But, like dumb statues or breathing stones,
3340	Gazed each on other, and look'd deadly pale.
3341	Which when I saw, I reprehended them;
3342	And ask'd the mayor what meant this wilful silence:
3343	His answer was, the people were not wont
3344	To be spoke to but by the recorder.
3345	Then he was urged to tell my tale again,
3346	'Thus saith the duke, thus hath the duke inferr'd;'
3347	But nothing spake in warrant from himself.
3348	When he had done, some followers of mine own,
3349	At the lower end of the hall, hurl'd up their caps,
3350	And some ten voices cried 'God save King Richard!'
3351	And thus I took the vantage of those few,
3352	'Thanks, gentle citizens and friends,' quoth I;
3353	'This general applause and loving shout
3354	Argues your wisdoms and your love to Richard:'
3355	And even here brake off, and came away.
3356	
3357	GLOUCESTER	What tongueless blocks were they! would not they speak?
3358	
3359	BUCKINGHAM	No, by my troth, my lord.
3360	
3361	GLOUCESTER	Will not the mayor then and his brethren come?
3362	
3363	BUCKINGHAM	The mayor is here at hand: intend some fear;
3364	Be not you spoke with, but by mighty suit:
3365	And look you get a prayer-book in your hand,
3366	And stand betwixt two churchmen, good my lord;
3367	For on that ground I'll build a holy descant:
3368	And be not easily won to our request:
3369	Play the maid's part, still answer nay, and take it.
3370	
3371	GLOUCESTER	I go; and if you plead as well for them
3372	As I can say nay to thee for myself,
3373	No doubt well bring it to a happy issue.
3374	
3375	BUCKINGHAM	Go, go, up to the leads; the lord mayor knocks.
3376	
3377	[Exit GLOUCESTER]
3378	
3379	[Enter the Lord Mayor and Citizens]
3380	
3381	Welcome my lord; I dance attendance here;
3382	I think the duke will not be spoke withal.
3383	
3384	[Enter CATESBY]
3385	
3386	Here comes his servant: how now, Catesby,
3387	What says he?
3388	
3389	CATESBY	             My lord: he doth entreat your grace;
3390	To visit him to-morrow or next day:
3391	He is within, with two right reverend fathers,
3392	Divinely bent to meditation;
3393	And no worldly suit would he be moved,
3394	To draw him from his holy exercise.
3395	
3396	BUCKINGHAM	Return, good Catesby, to thy lord again;
3397	Tell him, myself, the mayor and citizens,
3398	In deep designs and matters of great moment,
3399	No less importing than our general good,
3400	Are come to have some conference with his grace.
3401	
3402	CATESBY	I'll tell him what you say, my lord.
3403	
3404	[Exit]
3405	
3406	BUCKINGHAM	Ah, ha, my lord, this prince is not an Edward!
3407	He is not lolling on a lewd day-bed,
3408	But on his knees at meditation;
3409	Not dallying with a brace of courtezans,
3410	But meditating with two deep divines;
3411	Not sleeping, to engross his idle body,
3412	But praying, to enrich his watchful soul:
3413	Happy were England, would this gracious prince
3414	Take on himself the sovereignty thereof:
3415	But, sure, I fear, we shall ne'er win him to it.
3416	
3417	Lord Mayor	Marry, God forbid his grace should say us nay!
3418	
3419	BUCKINGHAM	I fear he will.
3420	
3421	[Re-enter CATESBY]
3422	
3423	How now, Catesby, what says your lord?
3424	
3425	CATESBY	My lord,
3426	He wonders to what end you have assembled
3427	Such troops of citizens to speak with him,
3428	His grace not being warn'd thereof before:
3429	My lord, he fears you mean no good to him.
3430	
3431	BUCKINGHAM	Sorry I am my noble cousin should
3432	Suspect me, that I mean no good to him:
3433	By heaven, I come in perfect love to him;
3434	And so once more return and tell his grace.
3435	
3436	[Exit CATESBY]
3437	
3438	When holy and devout religious men
3439	Are at their beads, 'tis hard to draw them thence,
3440	So sweet is zealous contemplation.
3441	
3442	[Enter GLOUCESTER aloft, between two Bishops.
3443	CATESBY returns]
3444	
3445	Lord Mayor	See, where he stands between two clergymen!
3446	
3447	BUCKINGHAM	Two props of virtue for a Christian prince,
3448	To stay him from the fall of vanity:
3449	And, see, a book of prayer in his hand,
3450	True ornaments to know a holy man.
3451	Famous Plantagenet, most gracious prince,
3452	Lend favourable ears to our request;
3453	And pardon us the interruption
3454	Of thy devotion and right Christian zeal.
3455	
3456	GLOUCESTER	My lord, there needs no such apology:
3457	I rather do beseech you pardon me,
3458	Who, earnest in the service of my God,
3459	Neglect the visitation of my friends.
3460	But, leaving this, what is your grace's pleasure?
3461	
3462	BUCKINGHAM	Even that, I hope, which pleaseth God above,
3463	And all good men of this ungovern'd isle.
3464	
3465	GLOUCESTER	I do suspect I have done some offence
3466	That seems disgracious in the city's eyes,
3467	And that you come to reprehend my ignorance.
3468	
3469	BUCKINGHAM	You have, my lord: would it might please your grace,
3470	At our entreaties, to amend that fault!
3471	
3472	GLOUCESTER	Else wherefore breathe I in a Christian land?
3473	
3474	BUCKINGHAM	Then know, it is your fault that you resign
3475	The supreme seat, the throne majestical,
3476	The scepter'd office of your ancestors,
3477	Your state of fortune and your due of birth,
3478	The lineal glory of your royal house,
3479	To the corruption of a blemished stock:
3480	Whilst, in the mildness of your sleepy thoughts,
3481	Which here we waken to our country's good,
3482	This noble isle doth want her proper limbs;
3483	Her face defaced with scars of infamy,
3484	Her royal stock graft with ignoble plants,
3485	And almost shoulder'd in the swallowing gulf
3486	Of blind forgetfulness and dark oblivion.
3487	Which to recure, we heartily solicit
3488	Your gracious self to take on you the charge
3489	And kingly government of this your land,
3490	Not as protector, steward, substitute,
3491	Or lowly factor for another's gain;
3492	But as successively from blood to blood,
3493	Your right of birth, your empery, your own.
3494	For this, consorted with the citizens,
3495	Your very worshipful and loving friends,
3496	And by their vehement instigation,
3497	In this just suit come I to move your grace.
3498	
3499	GLOUCESTER	I know not whether to depart in silence,
3500	Or bitterly to speak in your reproof.
3501	Best fitteth my degree or your condition
3502	If not to answer, you might haply think
3503	Tongue-tied ambition, not replying, yielded
3504	To bear the golden yoke of sovereignty,
3505	Which fondly you would here impose on me;
3506	If to reprove you for this suit of yours,
3507	So season'd with your faithful love to me.
3508	Then, on the other side, I cheque'd my friends.
3509	Therefore, to speak, and to avoid the first,
3510	And then, in speaking, not to incur the last,
3511	Definitively thus I answer you.
3512	Your love deserves my thanks; but my desert
3513	Unmeritable shuns your high request.
3514	First if all obstacles were cut away,
3515	And that my path were even to the crown,
3516	As my ripe revenue and due by birth
3517	Yet so much is my poverty of spirit,
3518	So mighty and so many my defects,
3519	As I had rather hide me from my greatness,
3520	Being a bark to brook no mighty sea,
3521	Than in my greatness covet to be hid,
3522	And in the vapour of my glory smother'd.
3523	But, God be thank'd, there's no need of me,
3524	And much I need to help you, if need were;
3525	The royal tree hath left us royal fruit,
3526	Which, mellow'd by the stealing hours of time,
3527	Will well become the seat of majesty,
3528	And make, no doubt, us happy by his reign.
3529	On him I lay what you would lay on me,
3530	The right and fortune of his happy stars;
3531	Which God defend that I should wring from him!
3532	
3533	BUCKINGHAM	My lord, this argues conscience in your grace;
3534	But the respects thereof are nice and trivial,
3535	All circumstances well considered.
3536	You say that Edward is your brother's son:
3537	So say we too, but not by Edward's wife;
3538	For first he was contract to Lady Lucy--
3539	Your mother lives a witness to that vow--
3540	And afterward by substitute betroth'd
3541	To Bona, sister to the King of France.
3542	These both put by a poor petitioner,
3543	A care-crazed mother of a many children,
3544	A beauty-waning and distressed widow,
3545	Even in the afternoon of her best days,
3546	Made prize and purchase of his lustful eye,
3547	Seduced the pitch and height of all his thoughts
3548	To base declension and loathed bigamy
3549	By her, in his unlawful bed, he got
3550	This Edward, whom our manners term the prince.
3551	More bitterly could I expostulate,
3552	Save that, for reverence to some alive,
3553	I give a sparing limit to my tongue.
3554	Then, good my lord, take to your royal self
3555	This proffer'd benefit of dignity;
3556	If non to bless us and the land withal,
3557	Yet to draw forth your noble ancestry
3558	From the corruption of abusing times,
3559	Unto a lineal true-derived course.
3560	
3561	Lord Mayor	Do, good my lord, your citizens entreat you.
3562	
3563	BUCKINGHAM	Refuse not, mighty lord, this proffer'd love.
3564	
3565	CATESBY	O, make them joyful, grant their lawful suit!
3566	
3567	GLOUCESTER	Alas, why would you heap these cares on me?
3568	I am unfit for state and majesty;
3569	I do beseech you, take it not amiss;
3570	I cannot nor I will not yield to you.
3571	
3572	BUCKINGHAM	If you refuse it,--as, in love and zeal,
3573	Loath to depose the child, Your brother's son;
3574	As well we know your tenderness of heart
3575	And gentle, kind, effeminate remorse,
3576	Which we have noted in you to your kin,
3577	And egally indeed to all estates,--
3578	Yet whether you accept our suit or no,
3579	Your brother's son shall never reign our king;
3580	But we will plant some other in the throne,
3581	To the disgrace and downfall of your house:
3582	And in this resolution here we leave you.--
3583	Come, citizens: 'zounds! I'll entreat no more.
3584	
3585	GLOUCESTER	O, do not swear, my lord of Buckingham.
3586	
3587	[Exit BUCKINGHAM with the Citizens]
3588	
3589	CATESBY	Call them again, my lord, and accept their suit.
3590	
3591	ANOTHER	Do, good my lord, lest all the land do rue it.
3592	
3593	GLOUCESTER	Would you enforce me to a world of care?
3594	Well, call them again. I am not made of stone,
3595	But penetrable to your. kind entreats,
3596	Albeit against my conscience and my soul.
3597	
3598	[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM and the rest]
3599	
3600	Cousin of Buckingham, and you sage, grave men,
3601	Since you will buckle fortune on my back,
3602	To bear her burthen, whether I will or no,
3603	I must have patience to endure the load:
3604	But if black scandal or foul-faced reproach
3605	Attend the sequel of your imposition,
3606	Your mere enforcement shall acquittance me
3607	From all the impure blots and stains thereof;
3608	For God he knows, and you may partly see,
3609	How far I am from the desire thereof.
3610	
3611	Lord Mayor	God bless your grace! we see it, and will say it.
3612	
3613	GLOUCESTER	In saying so, you shall but say the truth.
3614	
3615	BUCKINGHAM	Then I salute you with this kingly title:
3616	Long live Richard, England's royal king!
3617	
3618	
3619	Lord Mayor	|
3620	|  Amen.
3621	Citizens	|
3622	
3623	
3624	BUCKINGHAM	To-morrow will it please you to be crown'd?
3625	
3626	GLOUCESTER	Even when you please, since you will have it so.
3627	
3628	BUCKINGHAM	To-morrow, then, we will attend your grace:
3629	And so most joyfully we take our leave.
3630	
3631	GLOUCESTER	Come, let us to our holy task again.
3632	Farewell, good cousin; farewell, gentle friends.

3647	
3648	
3649	[Enter, on one side, QUEEN ELIZABETH, DUCHESS OF
3650	YORK, and DORSET; on the other, ANNE, Duchess of
3651	Gloucester, leading Lady Margaret Plantagenet,
3652	CLARENCE's young Daughter]
3653	
3654	DUCHESS OF YORK	Who meets us here?  my niece Plantagenet
3655	Led in the hand of her kind aunt of Gloucester?
3656	Now, for my life, she's wandering to the Tower,
3657	On pure heart's love to greet the tender princes.
3658	Daughter, well met.
3659	
3660	LADY ANNE	God give your graces both
3661	A happy and a joyful time of day!
3662	
3663	QUEEN ELIZABETH	As much to you, good sister! Whither away?
3664	
3665	LADY ANNE	No farther than the Tower; and, as I guess,
3666	Upon the like devotion as yourselves,
3667	To gratulate the gentle princes there.
3668	
3669	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Kind sister, thanks: we'll enter all together.
3670	
3671	[Enter BRAKENBURY]
3672	
3673	And, in good time, here the lieutenant comes.
3674	Master lieutenant, pray you, by your leave,
3675	How doth the prince, and my young son of York?
3676	
3677	BRAKENBURY	Right well, dear madam. By your patience,
3678	I may not suffer you to visit them;
3679	The king hath straitly charged the contrary.
3680	
3681	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The king! why, who's that?
3682	
3683	BRAKENBURY	I cry you mercy: I mean the lord protector.
3684	
3685	QUEEN ELIZABETH	The Lord protect him from that kingly title!
3686	Hath he set bounds betwixt their love and me?
3687	I am their mother; who should keep me from them?
3688	
3689	DUCHESS OF YORK	I am their fathers mother; I will see them.
3690	
3691	LADY ANNE	Their aunt I am in law, in love their mother:
3692	Then bring me to their sights; I'll bear thy blame
3693	And take thy office from thee, on my peril.
3694	
3695	BRAKENBURY	No, madam, no; I may not leave it so:
3696	I am bound by oath, and therefore pardon me.
3697	
3698	[Exit]
3699	
3700	[Enter LORD STANLEY]
3701	
3702	LORD STANLEY	Let me but meet you, ladies, one hour hence,
3703	And I'll salute your grace of York as mother,
3704	And reverend looker on, of two fair queens.
3705	
3706	[To LADY ANNE]
3707	
3708	Come, madam, you must straight to Westminster,
3709	There to be crowned Richard's royal queen.
3710	
3711	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, cut my lace in sunder, that my pent heart
3712	May have some scope to beat, or else I swoon
3713	With this dead-killing news!
3714	
3715	LADY ANNE	Despiteful tidings! O unpleasing news!
3716	
3717	DORSET	Be of good cheer: mother, how fares your grace?
3718	
3719	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O Dorset, speak not to me, get thee hence!
3720	Death and destruction dog thee at the heels;
3721	Thy mother's name is ominous to children.
3722	If thou wilt outstrip death, go cross the seas,
3723	And live with Richmond, from the reach of hell
3724	Go, hie thee, hie thee from this slaughter-house,
3725	Lest thou increase the number of the dead;
3726	And make me die the thrall of Margaret's curse,
3727	Nor mother, wife, nor England's counted queen.
3728	
3729	LORD STANLEY	Full of wise care is this your counsel, madam.
3730	Take all the swift advantage of the hours;
3731	You shall have letters from me to my son
3732	To meet you on the way, and welcome you.
3733	Be not ta'en tardy by unwise delay.
3734	
3735	DUCHESS OF YORK	O ill-dispersing wind of misery!
3736	O my accursed womb, the bed of death!
3737	A cockatrice hast thou hatch'd to the world,
3738	Whose unavoided eye is murderous.
3739	
3740	LORD STANLEY	Come, madam, come; I in all haste was sent.
3741	
3742	LADY ANNE	And I in all unwillingness will go.
3743	I would to God that the inclusive verge
3744	Of golden metal that must round my brow
3745	Were red-hot steel, to sear me to the brain!
3746	Anointed let me be with deadly venom,
3747	And die, ere men can say, God save the queen!
3748	
3749	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Go, go, poor soul, I envy not thy glory
3750	To feed my humour, wish thyself no harm.
3751	
3752	LADY ANNE	No! why?  When he that is my husband now
3753	Came to me, as I follow'd Henry's corse,
3754	When scarce the blood was well wash'd from his hands
3755	Which issued from my other angel husband
3756	And that dead saint which then I weeping follow'd;
3757	O, when, I say, I look'd on Richard's face,
3758	This was my wish: 'Be thou,' quoth I, ' accursed,
3759	For making me, so young, so old a widow!
3760	And, when thou wed'st, let sorrow haunt thy bed;
3761	And be thy wife--if any be so mad--
3762	As miserable by the life of thee
3763	As thou hast made me by my dear lord's death!
3764	Lo, ere I can repeat this curse again,
3765	Even in so short a space, my woman's heart
3766	Grossly grew captive to his honey words
3767	And proved the subject of my own soul's curse,
3768	Which ever since hath kept my eyes from rest;
3769	For never yet one hour in his bed
3770	Have I enjoy'd the golden dew of sleep,
3771	But have been waked by his timorous dreams.
3772	Besides, he hates me for my father Warwick;
3773	And will, no doubt, shortly be rid of me.
3774	
3775	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Poor heart, adieu! I pity thy complaining.
3776	
3777	LADY ANNE	No more than from my soul I mourn for yours.
3778	
3779	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Farewell, thou woful welcomer of glory!
3780	
3781	LADY ANNE	Adieu, poor soul, that takest thy leave of it!
3782	
3783	DUCHESS OF YORK	[To DORSET]
3784	
3785	Go thou to Richmond, and good fortune guide thee!
3786	
3787	[To LADY ANNE]
3788	
3789	Go thou to Richard, and good angels guard thee!
3790	
3791	[To QUEEN ELIZABETH]
3792	
3793	Go thou to sanctuary, and good thoughts possess thee!
3794	I to my grave, where peace and rest lie with me!
3795	Eighty odd years of sorrow have I seen,
3796	And each hour's joy wrecked with a week of teen.
3797	
3798	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Stay, yet look back with me unto the Tower.
3799	Pity, you ancient stones, those tender babes
3800	Whom envy hath immured within your walls!
3801	Rough cradle for such little pretty ones!
3802	Rude ragged nurse, old sullen playfellow
3803	For tender princes, use my babies well!
3804	So foolish sorrow bids your stones farewell.
3805	
3806	[Exeunt]

3811	KING RICHARD III
3812	
3813	
3814	ACT IV
3815	
3816	
3817	
3818	SCENE II	London. The palace.
3819	
3820	
3821	[Sennet. Enter KING RICHARD III, in pomp, crowned;
3822	BUCKINGHAM, CATESBY, a page, and others]
3823	
3824	KING RICHARD III	Stand all apart Cousin of Buckingham!
3825	
3826	BUCKINGHAM	My gracious sovereign?
3827	
3828	KING RICHARD III	Give me thy hand.
3829	
3830	[Here he ascendeth his throne]
3831	
3832	Thus high, by thy advice
3833	And thy assistance, is King Richard seated;
3834	But shall we wear these honours for a day?
3835	Or shall they last, and we rejoice in them?
3836	
3837	BUCKINGHAM	Still live they and for ever may they last!
3838	
3839	KING RICHARD III	O Buckingham, now do I play the touch,
3840	To try if thou be current gold indeed
3841	Young Edward lives: think now what I would say.
3842	
3843	BUCKINGHAM	Say on, my loving lord.
3844	
3845	KING RICHARD III	Why, Buckingham, I say, I would be king,
3846	
3847	BUCKINGHAM	Why, so you are, my thrice renowned liege.
3848	
3849	KING RICHARD III	Ha! am I king? 'tis so: but Edward lives.
3850	
3851	BUCKINGHAM	True, noble prince.
3852	
3853	KING RICHARD III	O bitter consequence,
3854	That Edward still should live! 'True, noble prince!'
3855	Cousin, thou wert not wont to be so dull:
3856	Shall I be plain? I wish the bastards dead;
3857	And I would have it suddenly perform'd.
3858	What sayest thou? speak suddenly; be brief.
3859	
3860	BUCKINGHAM	Your grace may do your pleasure.
3861	
3862	KING RICHARD III	Tut, tut, thou art all ice, thy kindness freezeth:
3863	Say, have I thy consent that they shall die?
3864	
3865	BUCKINGHAM	Give me some breath, some little pause, my lord
3866	Before I positively herein:
3867	I will resolve your grace immediately.
3868	
3869	[Exit]
3870	
3871	CATESBY	[Aside to a stander by]
3872	
3873	The king is angry: see, he bites the lip.
3874	
3875	KING RICHARD III	I will converse with iron-witted fools
3876	And unrespective boys: none are for me
3877	That look into me with considerate eyes:
3878	High-reaching Buckingham grows circumspect.
3879	Boy!
3880	
3881	Page	My lord?
3882	
3883	KING RICHARD III	Know'st thou not any whom corrupting gold
3884	Would tempt unto a close exploit of death?
3885	
3886	Page	My lord, I know a discontented gentleman,
3887	Whose humble means match not his haughty mind:
3888	Gold were as good as twenty orators,
3889	And will, no doubt, tempt him to any thing.
3890	
3891	KING RICHARD III	What is his name?
3892	
3893	Page	                His name, my lord, is Tyrrel.
3894	
3895	KING RICHARD III	I partly know the man: go, call him hither.
3896	
3897	[Exit Page]
3898	
3899	The deep-revolving witty Buckingham
3900	No more shall be the neighbour to my counsel:
3901	Hath he so long held out with me untired,
3902	And stops he now for breath?
3903	
3904	[Enter STANLEY]
3905	
3906	How now! what news with you?
3907	
3908	STANLEY	My lord, I hear the Marquis Dorset's fled
3909	To Richmond, in those parts beyond the sea
3910	Where he abides.
3911	
3912	[Stands apart]
3913	
3914	KING RICHARD III	Catesby!
3915	
3916	CATESBY	       My lord?
3917	
3918	KING RICHARD III	                         Rumour it abroad
3919	That Anne, my wife, is sick and like to die:
3920	I will take order for her keeping close.
3921	Inquire me out some mean-born gentleman,
3922	Whom I will marry straight to Clarence' daughter:
3923	The boy is foolish, and I fear not him.
3924	Look, how thou dream'st! I say again, give out
3925	That Anne my wife is sick and like to die:
3926	About it; for it stands me much upon,
3927	To stop all hopes whose growth may damage me.
3928	
3929	[Exit CATESBY]
3930	
3931	I must be married to my brother's daughter,
3932	Or else my kingdom stands on brittle glass.
3933	Murder her brothers, and then marry her!
3934	Uncertain way of gain! But I am in
3935	So far in blood that sin will pluck on sin:
3936	Tear-falling pity dwells not in this eye.
3937	
3938	[Re-enter Page, with TYRREL]
3939	
3940	Is thy name Tyrrel?
3941	
3942	TYRREL	James Tyrrel, and your most obedient subject.
3943	
3944	KING RICHARD III	Art thou, indeed?
3945	
3946	TYRREL	           Prove me, my gracious sovereign.
3947	
3948	KING RICHARD III	Darest thou resolve to kill a friend of mine?
3949	
3950	TYRREL	Ay, my lord;
3951	But I had rather kill two enemies.
3952	
3953	KING RICHARD III	Why, there thou hast it: two deep enemies,
3954	Foes to my rest and my sweet sleep's disturbers
3955	Are they that I would have thee deal upon:
3956	Tyrrel, I mean those bastards in the Tower.
3957	
3958	TYRREL	Let me have open means to come to them,
3959	And soon I'll rid you from the fear of them.
3960	
3961	KING RICHARD III	Thou sing'st sweet music. Hark, come hither, Tyrrel
3962	Go, by this token: rise, and lend thine ear:
3963	
3964	[Whispers]
3965	
3966	There is no more but so: say it is done,
3967	And I will love thee, and prefer thee too.
3968	
3969	TYRREL	'Tis done, my gracious lord.
3970	
3971	KING RICHARD III	Shall we hear from thee, Tyrrel, ere we sleep?
3972	
3973	TYRREL	Ye shall, my Lord.
3974	
3975	[Exit]
3976	
3977	[Re-enter BUCKINGHAM]
3978	
3979	BUCKINGHAM	My Lord, I have consider'd in my mind
3980	The late demand that you did sound me in.
3981	
3982	KING RICHARD III	Well, let that pass. Dorset is fled to Richmond.
3983	
3984	BUCKINGHAM	I hear that news, my lord.
3985	
3986	KING RICHARD III	Stanley, he is your wife's son well, look to it.
3987	
3988	BUCKINGHAM	My lord, I claim your gift, my due by promise,
3989	For which your honour and your faith is pawn'd;
3990	The earldom of Hereford and the moveables
3991	The which you promised I should possess.
3992	
3993	KING RICHARD III	Stanley, look to your wife; if she convey
3994	Letters to Richmond, you shall answer it.
3995	
3996	BUCKINGHAM	What says your highness to my just demand?
3997	
3998	KING RICHARD III	As I remember, Henry the Sixth
3999	Did prophesy that Richmond should be king,
4000	When Richmond was a little peevish boy.
4001	A king, perhaps, perhaps,--
4002	
4003	BUCKINGHAM	My lord!
4004	
4005	KING RICHARD III	How chance the prophet could not at that time
4006	Have told me, I being by, that I should kill him?
4007	
4008	BUCKINGHAM	My lord, your promise for the earldom,--
4009	
4010	KING RICHARD III	Richmond! When last I was at Exeter,
4011	The mayor in courtesy show'd me the castle,
4012	And call'd it Rougemont: at which name I started,
4013	Because a bard of Ireland told me once
4014	I should not live long after I saw Richmond.
4015	
4016	BUCKINGHAM	My Lord!
4017	
4018	KING RICHARD III	       Ay, what's o'clock?
4019	
4020	BUCKINGHAM	I am thus bold to put your grace in mind
4021	Of what you promised me.
4022	
4023	KING RICHARD III	Well, but what's o'clock?
4024	
4025	BUCKINGHAM	Upon the stroke of ten.
4026	
4027	KING RICHARD III	Well, let it strike.
4028	
4029	BUCKINGHAM	Why let it strike?
4030	
4031	KING RICHARD III	Because that, like a Jack, thou keep'st the stroke
4032	Betwixt thy begging and my meditation.
4033	I am not in the giving vein to-day.
4034	
4035	BUCKINGHAM	Why, then resolve me whether you will or no.
4036	
4037	KING RICHARD III	Tut, tut,
4038	Thou troublest me; am not in the vein.
4039	
4040	[Exeunt all but BUCKINGHAM]
4041	
4042	BUCKINGHAM	Is it even so? rewards he my true service
4043	With such deep contempt made I him king for this?
4044	O, let me think on Hastings, and be gone
4045	To Brecknock, while my fearful head is on!
4046	
4047	[Exit]
4048	
4049	
4050	
4051	
4052	KING RICHARD III
4053	
4054	
4055	ACT IV
4056	
4057	
4058	
4059	SCENE III	The same.
4060	
4061	
4062	[Enter TYRREL]
4063	
4064	TYRREL	The tyrannous and bloody deed is done.
4065	The most arch of piteous massacre
4066	That ever yet this land was guilty of.
4067	Dighton and Forrest, whom I did suborn
4068	To do this ruthless piece of butchery,
4069	Although they were flesh'd villains, bloody dogs,
4070	Melting with tenderness and kind compassion
4071	Wept like two children in their deaths' sad stories.
4072	'Lo, thus' quoth Dighton, 'lay those tender babes:'
4073	'Thus, thus,' quoth Forrest, 'girdling one another
4074	Within their innocent alabaster arms:
4075	Their lips were four red roses on a stalk,
4076	Which in their summer beauty kiss'd each other.
4077	A book of prayers on their pillow lay;
4078	Which once,' quoth Forrest, 'almost changed my mind;
4079	But O! the devil'--there the villain stopp'd
4080	Whilst Dighton thus told on: 'We smothered
4081	The most replenished sweet work of nature,
4082	That from the prime creation e'er she framed.'
4083	Thus both are gone with conscience and remorse;
4084	They could not speak; and so I left them both,
4085	To bring this tidings to the bloody king.
4086	And here he comes.
4087	
4088	[Enter KING RICHARD III]
4089	
4090	All hail, my sovereign liege!
4091	
4092	KING RICHARD III	Kind Tyrrel, am I happy in thy news?
4093	
4094	TYRREL	If to have done the thing you gave in charge
4095	Beget your happiness, be happy then,
4096	For it is done, my lord.
4097	
4098	KING RICHARD III	But didst thou see them dead?
4099	
4100	TYRREL	I did, my lord.
4101	
4102	KING RICHARD III	                 And buried, gentle Tyrrel?
4103	
4104	TYRREL	The chaplain of the Tower hath buried them;
4105	But how or in what place I do not know.
4106	
4107	KING RICHARD III	Come to me, Tyrrel, soon at after supper,
4108	And thou shalt tell the process of their death.
4109	Meantime, but think how I may do thee good,
4110	And be inheritor of thy desire.
4111	Farewell till soon.
4112	
4113	[Exit TYRREL]
4114	
4115	The son of Clarence have I pent up close;
4116	His daughter meanly have I match'd in marriage;
4117	The sons of Edward sleep in Abraham's bosom,
4118	And Anne my wife hath bid the world good night.
4119	Now, for I know the Breton Richmond aims
4120	At young Elizabeth, my brother's daughter,
4121	And, by that knot, looks proudly o'er the crown,
4122	To her I go, a jolly thriving wooer.
4123	
4124	[Enter CATESBY]
4125	
4126	CATESBY	My lord!
4127	
4128	KING RICHARD III	Good news or bad, that thou comest in so bluntly?
4129	
4130	CATESBY	Bad news, my lord: Ely is fled to Richmond;
4131	And Buckingham, back'd with the hardy Welshmen,
4132	Is in the field, and still his power increaseth.
4133	
4134	KING RICHARD III	Ely with Richmond troubles me more near
4135	Than Buckingham and his rash-levied army.
4136	Come, I have heard that fearful commenting
4137	Is leaden servitor to dull delay;
4138	Delay leads impotent and snail-paced beggary
4139	Then fiery expedition be my wing,
4140	Jove's Mercury, and herald for a king!
4141	Come, muster men: my counsel is my shield;
4142	We must be brief when traitors brave the field.
4143

4156	SCENE IV	Before the palace.
4157	
4158	
4159	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET]
4160	
4161	QUEEN MARGARET	So, now prosperity begins to mellow
4162	And drop into the rotten mouth of death.
4163	Here in these confines slily have I lurk'd,
4164	To watch the waning of mine adversaries.
4165	A dire induction am I witness to,
4166	And will to France, hoping the consequence
4167	Will prove as bitter, black, and tragical.
4168	Withdraw thee, wretched Margaret: who comes here?
4169	
4170	[Enter QUEEN ELIZABETH and the DUCHESS OF YORK]
4171	
4172	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Ah, my young princes! ah, my tender babes!
4173	My unblown flowers, new-appearing sweets!
4174	If yet your gentle souls fly in the air
4175	And be not fix'd in doom perpetual,
4176	Hover about me with your airy wings
4177	And hear your mother's lamentation!
4178	
4179	QUEEN MARGARET	Hover about her; say, that right for right
4180	Hath dimm'd your infant morn to aged night.
4181	
4182	DUCHESS OF YORK	So many miseries have crazed my voice,
4183	That my woe-wearied tongue is mute and dumb,
4184	Edward Plantagenet, why art thou dead?
4185	
4186	QUEEN MARGARET	Plantagenet doth quit Plantagenet.
4187	Edward for Edward pays a dying debt.
4188	
4189	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Wilt thou, O God, fly from such gentle lambs,
4190	And throw them in the entrails of the wolf?
4191	When didst thou sleep when such a deed was done?
4192	
4193	QUEEN MARGARET	When holy Harry died, and my sweet son.
4194	
4195	DUCHESS OF YORK	Blind sight, dead life, poor mortal living ghost,
4196	Woe's scene, world's shame, grave's due by life usurp'd,
4197	Brief abstract and record of tedious days,
4198	Rest thy unrest on England's lawful earth,
4199	
4200	[Sitting down]
4201	
4202	Unlawfully made drunk with innocents' blood!
4203	
4204	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, that thou wouldst as well afford a grave
4205	As thou canst yield a melancholy seat!
4206	Then would I hide my bones, not rest them here.
4207	O, who hath any cause to mourn but I?
4208	
4209	[Sitting down by her]
4210	
4211	QUEEN MARGARET	If ancient sorrow be most reverend,
4212	Give mine the benefit of seniory,
4213	And let my woes frown on the upper hand.
4214	If sorrow can admit society,
4215	
4216	[Sitting down with them]
4217	
4218	Tell o'er your woes again by viewing mine:
4219	I had an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
4220	I had a Harry, till a Richard kill'd him:
4221	Thou hadst an Edward, till a Richard kill'd him;
4222	Thou hadst a Richard, till a Richard killed him;
4223	
4224	DUCHESS OF YORK	I had a Richard too, and thou didst kill him;
4225	I had a Rutland too, thou holp'st to kill him.
4226	
4227	QUEEN MARGARET	Thou hadst a Clarence too, and Richard kill'd him.
4228	From forth the kennel of thy womb hath crept
4229	A hell-hound that doth hunt us all to death:
4230	That dog, that had his teeth before his eyes,
4231	To worry lambs and lap their gentle blood,
4232	That foul defacer of God's handiwork,
4233	That excellent grand tyrant of the earth,
4234	That reigns in galled eyes of weeping souls,
4235	Thy womb let loose, to chase us to our graves.
4236	O upright, just, and true-disposing God,
4237	How do I thank thee, that this carnal cur
4238	Preys on the issue of his mother's body,
4239	And makes her pew-fellow with others' moan!
4240	
4241	DUCHESS OF YORK	O Harry's wife, triumph not in my woes!
4242	God witness with me, I have wept for thine.
4243	
4244	QUEEN MARGARET	Bear with me; I am hungry for revenge,
4245	And now I cloy me with beholding it.
4246	Thy Edward he is dead, that stabb'd my Edward:
4247	Thy other Edward dead, to quit my Edward;
4248	Young York he is but boot, because both they
4249	Match not the high perfection of my loss:
4250	Thy Clarence he is dead that kill'd my Edward;
4251	And the beholders of this tragic play,
4252	The adulterate Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey,
4253	Untimely smother'd in their dusky graves.
4254	Richard yet lives, hell's black intelligencer,
4255	Only reserved their factor, to buy souls
4256	And send them thither: but at hand, at hand,
4257	Ensues his piteous and unpitied end:
4258	Earth gapes, hell burns, fiends roar, saints pray.
4259	To have him suddenly convey'd away.
4260	Cancel his bond of life, dear God, I prey,
4261	That I may live to say, The dog is dead!
4262	
4263	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O, thou didst prophesy the time would come
4264	That I should wish for thee to help me curse
4265	That bottled spider, that foul bunch-back'd toad!
4266	
4267	QUEEN MARGARET	I call'd thee then vain flourish of my fortune;
4268	I call'd thee then poor shadow, painted queen;
4269	The presentation of but what I was;
4270	The flattering index of a direful pageant;
4271	One heaved a-high, to be hurl'd down below;
4272	A mother only mock'd with two sweet babes;
4273	A dream of what thou wert, a breath, a bubble,
4274	A sign of dignity, a garish flag,
4275	To be the aim of every dangerous shot,
4276	A queen in jest, only to fill the scene.
4277	Where is thy husband now? where be thy brothers?
4278	Where are thy children? wherein dost thou, joy?
4279	Who sues to thee and cries 'God save the queen'?
4280	Where be the bending peers that flatter'd thee?
4281	Where be the thronging troops that follow'd thee?
4282	Decline all this, and see what now thou art:
4283	For happy wife, a most distressed widow;
4284	For joyful mother, one that wails the name;
4285	For queen, a very caitiff crown'd with care;
4286	For one being sued to, one that humbly sues;
4287	For one that scorn'd at me, now scorn'd of me;
4288	For one being fear'd of all, now fearing one;
4289	For one commanding all, obey'd of none.
4290	Thus hath the course of justice wheel'd about,
4291	And left thee but a very prey to time;
4292	Having no more but thought of what thou wert,
4293	To torture thee the more, being what thou art.
4294	Thou didst usurp my place, and dost thou not
4295	Usurp the just proportion of my sorrow?
4296	Now thy proud neck bears half my burthen'd yoke;
4297	From which even here I slip my weary neck,
4298	And leave the burthen of it all on thee.
4299	Farewell, York's wife, and queen of sad mischance:
4300	These English woes will make me smile in France.
4301	
4302	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O thou well skill'd in curses, stay awhile,
4303	And teach me how to curse mine enemies!
4304	
4305	QUEEN MARGARET	Forbear to sleep the nights, and fast the days;
4306	Compare dead happiness with living woe;
4307	Think that thy babes were fairer than they were,
4308	And he that slew them fouler than he is:
4309	Bettering thy loss makes the bad causer worse:
4310	Revolving this will teach thee how to curse.
4311	
4312	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My words are dull; O, quicken them with thine!
4313	
4314	QUEEN MARGARET	Thy woes will make them sharp, and pierce like mine.
4315	
4316	[Exit]
4317	
4318	DUCHESS OF YORK	Why should calamity be full of words?
4319	
4320	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Windy attorneys to their client woes,
4321	Airy succeeders of intestate joys,
4322	Poor breathing orators of miseries!
4323	Let them have scope: though what they do impart
4324	Help not all, yet do they ease the heart.
4325	
4326	DUCHESS OF YORK	If so, then be not tongue-tied: go with me.
4327	And in the breath of bitter words let's smother
4328	My damned son, which thy two sweet sons smother'd.
4329	I hear his drum: be copious in exclaims.
4330	
4331	[Enter KING RICHARD III, marching, with drums and trumpets]
4332	
4333	KING RICHARD III	Who intercepts my expedition?
4334	
4335	DUCHESS OF YORK	O, she that might have intercepted thee,
4336	By strangling thee in her accursed womb
4337	From all the slaughters, wretch, that thou hast done!
4338	
4339	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Hidest thou that forehead with a golden crown,
4340	Where should be graven, if that right were right,
4341	The slaughter of the prince that owed that crown,
4342	And the dire death of my two sons and brothers?
4343	Tell me, thou villain slave, where are my children?
4344	
4345	DUCHESS OF YORK	Thou toad, thou toad, where is thy brother Clarence?
4346	And little Ned Plantagenet, his son?
4347	
4348	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Where is kind Hastings, Rivers, Vaughan, Grey?
4349	
4350	KING RICHARD III	A flourish, trumpets! strike alarum, drums!
4351	Let not the heavens hear these tell-tale women
4352	Rail on the Lord's enointed: strike, I say!
4353	
4354	[Flourish. Alarums]
4355	
4356	Either be patient, and entreat me fair,
4357	Or with the clamorous report of war
4358	Thus will I drown your exclamations.
4359	
4360	DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou my son?
4361	
4362	KING RICHARD III	Ay, I thank God, my father, and yourself.
4363	
4364	DUCHESS OF YORK	Then patiently hear my impatience.
4365	
4366	KING RICHARD III	Madam, I have a touch of your condition,
4367	Which cannot brook the accent of reproof.
4368	
4369	DUCHESS OF YORK	O, let me speak!
4370	
4371	KING RICHARD III	                  Do then: but I'll not hear.
4372	
4373	DUCHESS OF YORK	I will be mild and gentle in my speech.
4374	
4375	KING RICHARD III	And brief, good mother; for I am in haste.
4376	
4377	DUCHESS OF YORK	Art thou so hasty? I have stay'd for thee,
4378	God knows, in anguish, pain and agony.
4379	
4380	KING RICHARD III	And came I not at last to comfort you?
4381	
4382	DUCHESS OF YORK	No, by the holy rood, thou know'st it well,
4383	Thou camest on earth to make the earth my hell.
4384	A grievous burthen was thy birth to me;
4385	Tetchy and wayward was thy infancy;
4386	Thy school-days frightful, desperate, wild, and furious,
4387	Thy prime of manhood daring, bold, and venturous,
4388	Thy age confirm'd, proud, subdued, bloody,
4389	treacherous,
4390	More mild, but yet more harmful, kind in hatred:
4391	What comfortable hour canst thou name,
4392	That ever graced me in thy company?
4393	
4394	KING RICHARD III	Faith, none, but Humphrey Hour, that call'd
4395	your grace
4396	To breakfast once forth of my company.
4397	If I be so disgracious in your sight,
4398	Let me march on, and not offend your grace.
4399	Strike the drum.
4400	
4401	DUCHESS OF YORK	                  I prithee, hear me speak.
4402	
4403	KING RICHARD III	You speak too bitterly.
4404	
4405	DUCHESS OF YORK	Hear me a word;
4406	For I shall never speak to thee again.
4407	
4408	KING RICHARD III	So.
4409	
4410	DUCHESS OF YORK	Either thou wilt die, by God's just ordinance,
4411	Ere from this war thou turn a conqueror,
4412	Or I with grief and extreme age shall perish
4413	And never look upon thy face again.
4414	Therefore take with thee my most heavy curse;
4415	Which, in the day of battle, tire thee more
4416	Than all the complete armour that thou wear'st!
4417	My prayers on the adverse party fight;
4418	And there the little souls of Edward's children
4419	Whisper the spirits of thine enemies
4420	And promise them success and victory.
4421	Bloody thou art, bloody will be thy end;
4422	Shame serves thy life and doth thy death attend.
4423	
4424	[Exit]
4425	
4426	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Though far more cause, yet much less spirit to curse
4427	Abides in me; I say amen to all.
4428	
4429	KING RICHARD III	Stay, madam; I must speak a word with you.
4430	
4431	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I have no more sons of the royal blood
4432	For thee to murder: for my daughters, Richard,
4433	They shall be praying nuns, not weeping queens;
4434	And therefore level not to hit their lives.
4435	
4436	KING RICHARD III	You have a daughter call'd Elizabeth,
4437	Virtuous and fair, royal and gracious.
4438	
4439	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And must she die for this? O, let her live,
4440	And I'll corrupt her manners, stain her beauty;
4441	Slander myself as false to Edward's bed;
4442	Throw over her the veil of infamy:
4443	So she may live unscarr'd of bleeding slaughter,
4444	I will confess she was not Edward's daughter.
4445	
4446	KING RICHARD III	Wrong not her birth, she is of royal blood.
4447	
4448	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To save her life, I'll say she is not so.
4449	
4450	KING RICHARD III	Her life is only safest in her birth.
4451	
4452	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And only in that safety died her brothers.
4453	
4454	KING RICHARD III	Lo, at their births good stars were opposite.
4455	
4456	QUEEN ELIZABETH	No, to their lives bad friends were contrary.
4457	
4458	KING RICHARD III	All unavoided is the doom of destiny.
4459	
4460	QUEEN ELIZABETH	True, when avoided grace makes destiny:
4461	My babes were destined to a fairer death,
4462	If grace had bless'd thee with a fairer life.
4463	
4464	KING RICHARD III	You speak as if that I had slain my cousins.
4465	
4466	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Cousins, indeed; and by their uncle cozen'd
4467	Of comfort, kingdom, kindred, freedom, life.
4468	Whose hand soever lanced their tender hearts,
4469	Thy head, all indirectly, gave direction:
4470	No doubt the murderous knife was dull and blunt
4471	Till it was whetted on thy stone-hard heart,
4472	To revel in the entrails of my lambs.
4473	But that still use of grief makes wild grief tame,
4474	My tongue should to thy ears not name my boys
4475	Till that my nails were anchor'd in thine eyes;
4476	And I, in such a desperate bay of death,
4477	Like a poor bark, of sails and tackling reft,
4478	Rush all to pieces on thy rocky bosom.
4479	
4480	KING RICHARD III	Madam, so thrive I in my enterprise
4481	And dangerous success of bloody wars,
4482	As I intend more good to you and yours,
4483	Than ever you or yours were by me wrong'd!
4484	
4485	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What good is cover'd with the face of heaven,
4486	To be discover'd, that can do me good?
4487	
4488	KING RICHARD III	The advancement of your children, gentle lady.
4489	
4490	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Up to some scaffold, there to lose their heads?
4491	
4492	KING RICHARD III	No, to the dignity and height of honour
4493	The high imperial type of this earth's glory.
4494	
4495	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Flatter my sorrows with report of it;
4496	Tell me what state, what dignity, what honour,
4497	Canst thou demise to any child of mine?
4498	
4499	KING RICHARD III	Even all I have; yea, and myself and all,
4500	Will I withal endow a child of thine;
4501	So in the Lethe of thy angry soul
4502	Thou drown the sad remembrance of those wrongs
4503	Which thou supposest I have done to thee.
4504	
4505	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Be brief, lest that be process of thy kindness
4506	Last longer telling than thy kindness' date.
4507	
4508	KING RICHARD III	Then know, that from my soul I love thy daughter.
4509	
4510	QUEEN ELIZABETH	My daughter's mother thinks it with her soul.
4511	
4512	KING RICHARD III	What do you think?
4513	
4514	QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou dost love my daughter from thy soul:
4515	So from thy soul's love didst thou love her brothers;
4516	And from my heart's love I do thank thee for it.
4517	
4518	KING RICHARD III	Be not so hasty to confound my meaning:
4519	I mean, that with my soul I love thy daughter,
4520	And mean to make her queen of England.
4521	
4522	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Say then, who dost thou mean shall be her king?
4523	
4524	KING RICHARD III	Even he that makes her queen who should be else?
4525	
4526	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What, thou?
4527	
4528	KING RICHARD III	I, even I: what think you of it, madam?
4529	
4530	QUEEN ELIZABETH	How canst thou woo her?
4531	
4532	KING RICHARD III	That would I learn of you,
4533	As one that are best acquainted with her humour.
4534	
4535	QUEEN ELIZABETH	And wilt thou learn of me?
4536	
4537	KING RICHARD III	Madam, with all my heart.
4538	
4539	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Send to her, by the man that slew her brothers,
4540	A pair of bleeding-hearts; thereon engrave
4541	Edward and York; then haply she will weep:
4542	Therefore present to her--as sometime Margaret
4543	Did to thy father, steep'd in Rutland's blood,--
4544	A handkerchief; which, say to her, did drain
4545	The purple sap from her sweet brother's body
4546	And bid her dry her weeping eyes therewith.
4547	If this inducement force her not to love,
4548	Send her a story of thy noble acts;
4549	Tell her thou madest away her uncle Clarence,
4550	Her uncle Rivers; yea, and, for her sake,
4551	Madest quick conveyance with her good aunt Anne.
4552	
4553	KING RICHARD III	Come, come, you mock me; this is not the way
4554	To win our daughter.
4555	
4556	QUEEN ELIZABETH	There is no other way
4557	Unless thou couldst put on some other shape,
4558	And not be Richard that hath done all this.
4559	
4560	KING RICHARD III	Say that I did all this for love of her.
4561	
4562	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Nay, then indeed she cannot choose but hate thee,
4563	Having bought love with such a bloody spoil.
4564	
4565	KING RICHARD III	Look, what is done cannot be now amended:
4566	Men shall deal unadvisedly sometimes,
4567	Which after hours give leisure to repent.
4568	If I did take the kingdom from your sons,
4569	To make amends, Ill give it to your daughter.
4570	If I have kill'd the issue of your womb,
4571	To quicken your increase, I will beget
4572	Mine issue of your blood upon your daughter
4573	A grandam's name is little less in love
4574	Than is the doting title of a mother;
4575	They are as children but one step below,
4576	Even of your mettle, of your very blood;
4577	Of an one pain, save for a night of groans
4578	Endured of her, for whom you bid like sorrow.
4579	Your children were vexation to your youth,
4580	But mine shall be a comfort to your age.
4581	The loss you have is but a son being king,
4582	And by that loss your daughter is made queen.
4583	I cannot make you what amends I would,
4584	Therefore accept such kindness as I can.
4585	Dorset your son, that with a fearful soul
4586	Leads discontented steps in foreign soil,
4587	This fair alliance quickly shall call home
4588	To high promotions and great dignity:
4589	The king, that calls your beauteous daughter wife.
4590	Familiarly shall call thy Dorset brother;
4591	Again shall you be mother to a king,
4592	And all the ruins of distressful times
4593	Repair'd with double riches of content.
4594	What! we have many goodly days to see:
4595	The liquid drops of tears that you have shed
4596	Shall come again, transform'd to orient pearl,
4597	Advantaging their loan with interest
4598	Of ten times double gain of happiness.
4599	Go, then my mother, to thy daughter go
4600	Make bold her bashful years with your experience;
4601	Prepare her ears to hear a wooer's tale
4602	Put in her tender heart the aspiring flame
4603	Of golden sovereignty; acquaint the princess
4604	With the sweet silent hours of marriage joys
4605	And when this arm of mine hath chastised
4606	The petty rebel, dull-brain'd Buckingham,
4607	Bound with triumphant garlands will I come
4608	And lead thy daughter to a conqueror's bed;
4609	To whom I will retail my conquest won,
4610	And she shall be sole victress, Caesar's Caesar.
4611	
4612	QUEEN ELIZABETH	What were I best to say? her father's brother
4613	Would be her lord? or shall I say, her uncle?
4614	Or, he that slew her brothers and her uncles?
4615	Under what title shall I woo for thee,
4616	That God, the law, my honour and her love,
4617	Can make seem pleasing to her tender years?
4618	
4619	KING RICHARD III	Infer fair England's peace by this alliance.
4620	
4621	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Which she shall purchase with still lasting war.
4622	
4623	KING RICHARD III	Say that the king, which may command, entreats.
4624	
4625	QUEEN ELIZABETH	That at her hands which the king's King forbids.
4626	
4627	KING RICHARD III	Say, she shall be a high and mighty queen.
4628	
4629	QUEEN ELIZABETH	To wail the tide, as her mother doth.
4630	
4631	KING RICHARD III	Say, I will love her everlastingly.
4632	
4633	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long shall that title 'ever' last?
4634	
4635	KING RICHARD III	Sweetly in force unto her fair life's end.
4636	
4637	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But how long fairly shall her sweet lie last?
4638	
4639	KING RICHARD III	So long as heaven and nature lengthens it.
4640	
4641	QUEEN ELIZABETH	So long as hell and Richard likes of it.
4642	
4643	KING RICHARD III	Say, I, her sovereign, am her subject love.
4644	
4645	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But she, your subject, loathes such sovereignty.
4646	
4647	KING RICHARD III	Be eloquent in my behalf to her.
4648	
4649	QUEEN ELIZABETH	An honest tale speeds best being plainly told.
4650	
4651	KING RICHARD III	Then in plain terms tell her my loving tale.
4652	
4653	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Plain and not honest is too harsh a style.
4654	
4655	KING RICHARD III	Your reasons are too shallow and too quick.
4656	
4657	QUEEN ELIZABETH	O no, my reasons are too deep and dead;
4658	Too deep and dead, poor infants, in their grave.
4659	
4660	KING RICHARD III	Harp not on that string, madam; that is past.
4661	
4662	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Harp on it still shall I till heart-strings break.
4663	
4664	KING RICHARD III	Now, by my George, my garter, and my crown,--
4665	
4666	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Profaned, dishonour'd, and the third usurp'd.
4667	
4668	KING RICHARD III	I swear--
4669	
4670	QUEEN ELIZABETH	        By nothing; for this is no oath:
4671	The George, profaned, hath lost his holy honour;
4672	The garter, blemish'd, pawn'd his knightly virtue;
4673	The crown, usurp'd, disgraced his kingly glory.
4674	if something thou wilt swear to be believed,
4675	Swear then by something that thou hast not wrong'd.
4676	
4677	KING RICHARD III	Now, by the world--
4678	
4679	QUEEN ELIZABETH	'Tis full of thy foul wrongs.
4680	
4681	KING RICHARD III	My father's death--
4682	
4683	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Thy life hath that dishonour'd.
4684	
4685	KING RICHARD III	Then, by myself--
4686	
4687	QUEEN ELIZABETH	                  Thyself thyself misusest.
4688	
4689	KING RICHARD III	Why then, by God--
4690	
4691	QUEEN ELIZABETH	                  God's wrong is most of all.
4692	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
4693	The unity the king thy brother made
4694	Had not been broken, nor my brother slain:
4695	If thou hadst fear'd to break an oath by Him,
4696	The imperial metal, circling now thy brow,
4697	Had graced the tender temples of my child,
4698	And both the princes had been breathing here,
4699	Which now, two tender playfellows to dust,
4700	Thy broken faith hath made a prey for worms.
4701	What canst thou swear by now?
4702	
4703	KING RICHARD III	The time to come.
4704	
4705	QUEEN ELIZABETH	That thou hast wronged in the time o'erpast;
4706	For I myself have many tears to wash
4707	Hereafter time, for time past wrong'd by thee.
4708	The children live, whose parents thou hast
4709	slaughter'd,
4710	Ungovern'd youth, to wail it in their age;
4711	The parents live, whose children thou hast butcher'd,
4712	Old wither'd plants, to wail it with their age.
4713	Swear not by time to come; for that thou hast
4714	Misused ere used, by time misused o'erpast.
4715	
4716	KING RICHARD III	As I intend to prosper and repent,
4717	So thrive I in my dangerous attempt
4718	Of hostile arms! myself myself confound!
4719	Heaven and fortune bar me happy hours!
4720	Day, yield me not thy light; nor, night, thy rest!
4721	Be opposite all planets of good luck
4722	To my proceedings, if, with pure heart's love,
4723	Immaculate devotion, holy thoughts,
4724	I tender not thy beauteous princely daughter!
4725	In her consists my happiness and thine;
4726	Without her, follows to this land and me,
4727	To thee, herself, and many a Christian soul,
4728	Death, desolation, ruin and decay:
4729	It cannot be avoided but by this;
4730	It will not be avoided but by this.
4731	Therefore, good mother,--I must can you so--
4732	Be the attorney of my love to her:
4733	Plead what I will be, not what I have been;
4734	Not my deserts, but what I will deserve:
4735	Urge the necessity and state of times,
4736	And be not peevish-fond in great designs.
4737	
4738	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I be tempted of the devil thus?
4739	
4740	KING RICHARD III	Ay, if the devil tempt thee to do good.
4741	
4742	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I forget myself to be myself?
4743	
4744	KING RICHARD III	Ay, if yourself's remembrance wrong yourself.
4745	
4746	QUEEN ELIZABETH	But thou didst kill my children.
4747	
4748	KING RICHARD III	But in your daughter's womb I bury them:
4749	Where in that nest of spicery they shall breed
4750	Selves of themselves, to your recomforture.
4751	
4752	QUEEN ELIZABETH	Shall I go win my daughter to thy will?
4753	
4754	KING RICHARD III	And be a happy mother by the deed.
4755	
4756	QUEEN ELIZABETH	I go. Write to me very shortly.
4757	And you shall understand from me her mind.
4758	
4759	KING RICHARD III	Bear her my true love's kiss; and so, farewell.
4760	
4761	[Exit QUEEN ELIZABETH]
4762	
4763	Relenting fool, and shallow, changing woman!
4764	
4765	[Enter RATCLIFF; CATESBY following]
4766	
4767	How now! what news?
4768	
4769	RATCLIFF	My gracious sovereign, on the western coast
4770	Rideth a puissant navy; to the shore
4771	Throng many doubtful hollow-hearted friends,
4772	Unarm'd, and unresolved to beat them back:
4773	'Tis thought that Richmond is their admiral;
4774	And there they hull, expecting but the aid
4775	Of Buckingham to welcome them ashore.
4776	
4777	KING RICHARD III	Some light-foot friend post to the Duke of Norfolk:
4778	Ratcliff, thyself, or Catesby; where is he?
4779	
4780	CATESBY	Here, my lord.
4781	
4782	KING RICHARD III	Fly to the duke:
4783	
4784	[To RATCLIFF]
4785	
4786	Post thou to Salisbury
4787	When thou comest thither--
4788	
4789	[To CATESBY]
4790	
4791	Dull, unmindful villain,
4792	Why stand'st thou still, and go'st not to the duke?
4793	
4794	CATESBY	First, mighty sovereign, let me know your mind,
4795	What from your grace I shall deliver to him.
4796	
4797	KING RICHARD III	O, true, good Catesby: bid him levy straight
4798	The greatest strength and power he can make,
4799	And meet me presently at Salisbury.
4800	
4801	CATESBY	I go.
4802	
4803	[Exit]
4804	
4805	RATCLIFF	What is't your highness' pleasure I shall do at
4806	Salisbury?
4807	
4808	KING RICHARD III	Why, what wouldst thou do there before I go?
4809	
4810	RATCLIFF	Your highness told me I should post before.
4811	
4812	KING RICHARD III	My mind is changed, sir, my mind is changed.
4813	
4814	[Enter STANLEY]
4815	
4816	How now, what news with you?
4817	
4818	STANLEY	None good, my lord, to please you with the hearing;
4819	Nor none so bad, but it may well be told.
4820	
4821	KING RICHARD III	Hoyday, a riddle! neither good nor bad!
4822	Why dost thou run so many mile about,
4823	When thou mayst tell thy tale a nearer way?
4824	Once more, what news?
4825	
4826	STANLEY	Richmond is on the seas.
4827	
4828	KING RICHARD III	There let him sink, and be the seas on him!
4829	White-liver'd runagate, what doth he there?
4830	
4831	STANLEY	I know not, mighty sovereign, but by guess.
4832	
4833	KING RICHARD III	Well, sir, as you guess, as you guess?
4834	
4835	STANLEY	Stirr'd up by Dorset, Buckingham, and Ely,
4836	He makes for England, there to claim the crown.
4837	
4838	KING RICHARD III	Is the chair empty? is the sword unsway'd?
4839	Is the king dead? the empire unpossess'd?
4840	What heir of York is there alive but we?
4841	And who is England's king but great York's heir?
4842	Then, tell me, what doth he upon the sea?
4843	
4844	STANLEY	Unless for that, my liege, I cannot guess.
4845	
4846	KING RICHARD III	Unless for that he comes to be your liege,
4847	You cannot guess wherefore the Welshman comes.
4848	Thou wilt revolt, and fly to him, I fear.
4849	
4850	STANLEY	No, mighty liege; therefore mistrust me not.
4851	
4852	KING RICHARD III	Where is thy power, then, to beat him back?
4853	Where are thy tenants and thy followers?
4854	Are they not now upon the western shore.
4855	Safe-conducting the rebels from their ships!
4856	
4857	STANLEY	No, my good lord, my friends are in the north.
4858	
4859	KING RICHARD III	Cold friends to Richard: what do they in the north,
4860	When they should serve their sovereign in the west?
4861	
4862	STANLEY	They have not been commanded, mighty sovereign:
4863	Please it your majesty to give me leave,
4864	I'll muster up my friends, and meet your grace
4865	Where and what time your majesty shall please.
4866	
4867	KING RICHARD III	Ay, ay. thou wouldst be gone to join with Richmond:
4868	I will not trust you, sir.
4869	
4870	STANLEY	Most mighty sovereign,
4871	You have no cause to hold my friendship doubtful:
4872	I never was nor never will be false.
4873	
4874	KING RICHARD III	Well,
4875	Go muster men; but, hear you, leave behind
4876	Your son, George Stanley: look your faith be firm.
4877	Or else his head's assurance is but frail.
4878	
4879	STANLEY	So deal with him as I prove true to you.

4885	Messenger	My gracious sovereign, now in Devonshire,
4886	As I by friends am well advertised,

4889	With many more confederates, are in arms.
4890	
4891	[Enter another Messenger]
4892	
4893	Second Messenger	My liege, in Kent the Guildfords are in arms;
4894	And every hour more competitors
4895	Flock to their aid, and still their power increaseth.
4896	
4897	[Enter another Messenger]
4898	
4899	Third Messenger	My lord, the army of the Duke of Buckingham--
4900	
4901	KING RICHARD III	Out on you, owls! nothing but songs of death?
4902	
4903	[He striketh him]
4904	
4905	Take that, until thou bring me better news.
4906	
4907	Third Messenger	The news I have to tell your majesty
4908	Is, that by sudden floods and fall of waters,
4909	Buckingham's army is dispersed and scatter'd;
4910	And he himself wander'd away alone,
4911	No man knows whither.
4912	
4913	KING RICHARD III	I cry thee mercy:
4914	There is my purse to cure that blow of thine.
4915	Hath any well-advised friend proclaim'd
4916	Reward to him that brings the traitor in?
4917	
4918	Third Messenger	Such proclamation hath been made, my liege.
4919	
4920	[Enter another Messenger]
4921	
4922	Fourth Messenger	Sir Thomas Lovel and Lord Marquis Dorset,
4923	'Tis said, my liege, in Yorkshire are in arms.
4924	Yet this good comfort bring I to your grace,
4925	The Breton navy is dispersed by tempest:
4926	Richmond, in Yorkshire, sent out a boat
4927	Unto the shore, to ask those on the banks
4928	If they were his assistants, yea or no;
4929	Who answer'd him, they came from Buckingham.
4930	Upon his party: he, mistrusting them,
4931	Hoisted sail and made away for Brittany.
4932	
4933	KING RICHARD III	March on, march on, since we are up in arms;
4934	If not to fight with foreign enemies,
4935	Yet to beat down these rebels here at home.
4936	
4937	[Re-enter CATESBY]
4938	
4939	CATESBY	My liege, the Duke of Buckingham is taken;
4940	That is the best news: that the Earl of Richmond
4941	Is with a mighty power landed at Milford,
4942	Is colder tidings, yet they must be told.
4943	
4944	KING RICHARD III	Away towards Salisbury! while we reason here,
4945	A royal battle might be won and lost
4946	Some one take order Buckingham be brought
4947	To Salisbury; the rest march on with me.

4965	
4966	DERBY	Sir Christopher, tell Richmond this from me:
4967	That in the sty of this most bloody boar
4968	My son George Stanley is frank'd up in hold:
4969	If I revolt, off goes young George's head;
4970	The fear of that withholds my present aid.
4971	But, tell me, where is princely Richmond now?
4972	
4973	CHRISTOPHER	At Pembroke, or at Harford-west, in Wales.
4974	
4975	DERBY	What men of name resort to him?
4976	
4977	CHRISTOPHER	Sir Walter Herbert, a renowned soldier;
4978	Sir Gilbert Talbot, Sir William Stanley;
4979	Oxford, redoubted Pembroke, Sir James Blunt,
4980	And Rice ap Thomas with a valiant crew;
4981	And many more of noble fame and worth:
4982	And towards London they do bend their course,
4983	If by the way they be not fought withal.
4984	
4985	DERBY	Return unto thy lord; commend me to him:
4986	Tell him the queen hath heartily consented
4987	He shall espouse Elizabeth her daughter.
4988	These letters will resolve him of my mind. Farewell.

5007	
5008	BUCKINGHAM	Will not King Richard let me speak with him?
5009	
5010	Sheriff	No, my good lord; therefore be patient.
5011	
5012	BUCKINGHAM	Hastings, and Edward's children, Rivers, Grey,
5013	Holy King Henry, and thy fair son Edward,
5014	Vaughan, and all that have miscarried
5015	By underhand corrupted foul injustice,
5016	If that your moody discontented souls
5017	Do through the clouds behold this present hour,
5018	Even for revenge mock my destruction!
5019	This is All-Souls' day, fellows, is it not?
5020	
5021	Sheriff	It is, my lord.
5022	
5023	BUCKINGHAM	Why, then All-Souls' day is my body's doomsday.
5024	This is the day that, in King Edward's time,
5025	I wish't might fall on me, when I was found
5026	False to his children or his wife's allies
5027	This is the day wherein I wish'd to fall
5028	By the false faith of him I trusted most;
5029	This, this All-Souls' day to my fearful soul
5030	Is the determined respite of my wrongs:
5031	That high All-Seer that I dallied with
5032	Hath turn'd my feigned prayer on my head
5033	And given in earnest what I begg'd in jest.
5034	Thus doth he force the swords of wicked men
5035	To turn their own points on their masters' bosoms:
5036	Now Margaret's curse is fallen upon my head;
5037	'When he,' quoth she, 'shall split thy heart with sorrow,
5038	Remember Margaret was a prophetess.'
5039	Come, sirs, convey me to the block of shame;
5040	Wrong hath but wrong, and blame the due of blame.

5059	
5060	RICHMOND	Fellows in arms, and my most loving friends,
5061	Bruised underneath the yoke of tyranny,
5062	Thus far into the bowels of the land
5063	Have we march'd on without impediment;
5064	And here receive we from our father Stanley
5065	Lines of fair comfort and encouragement.
5066	The wretched, bloody, and usurping boar,
5067	That spoil'd your summer fields and fruitful vines,
5068	Swills your warm blood like wash, and makes his trough
5069	In your embowell'd bosoms, this foul swine
5070	Lies now even in the centre of this isle,
5071	Near to the town of Leicester, as we learn
5072	From Tamworth thither is but one day's march.
5073	In God's name, cheerly on, courageous friends,
5074	To reap the harvest of perpetual peace
5075	By this one bloody trial of sharp war.
5076	
5077	OXFORD	Every man's conscience is a thousand swords,
5078	To fight against that bloody homicide.
5079	
5080	HERBERT	I doubt not but his friends will fly to us.
5081	
5082	BLUNT	He hath no friends but who are friends for fear.
5083	Which in his greatest need will shrink from him.
5084	
5085	RICHMOND	All for our vantage. Then, in God's name, march:
5086	True hope is swift, and flies with swallow's wings:

5108	My Lord of Surrey, why look you so sad?
5109	
5110	SURREY	My heart is ten times lighter than my looks.
5111	
5112	KING RICHARD III	My Lord of Norfolk,--
5113	
5114	NORFOLK	Here, most gracious liege.
5115	
5116	
5117	KING RICHARD III	Norfolk, we must have knocks; ha! must we not?
5118	
5119	NORFOLK	We must both give and take, my gracious lord.
5120	
5121	KING RICHARD III	Up with my tent there! here will I lie tonight;
5122	But where to-morrow?  Well, all's one for that.
5123	Who hath descried the number of the foe?
5124	
5125	NORFOLK	Six or seven thousand is their utmost power.
5126	
5127	KING RICHARD III	Why, our battalion trebles that account:
5128	Besides, the king's name is a tower of strength,
5129	Which they upon the adverse party want.
5130	Up with my tent there! Valiant gentlemen,
5131	Let us survey the vantage of the field
5132	Call for some men of sound direction
5133	Let's want no discipline, make no delay,
5134	For, lords, to-morrow is a busy day.

5143	And by the bright track of his fiery car,
5144	Gives signal, of a goodly day to-morrow.
5145	Sir William Brandon, you shall bear my standard.
5146	Give me some ink and paper in my tent
5147	I'll draw the form and model of our battle,
5148	Limit each leader to his several charge,
5149	And part in just proportion our small strength.
5150	My Lord of Oxford, you, Sir William Brandon,
5151	And you, Sir Walter Herbert, stay with me.
5152	The Earl of Pembroke keeps his regiment:
5153	Good Captain Blunt, bear my good night to him
5154	And by the second hour in the morning
5155	Desire the earl to see me in my tent:
5156	Yet one thing more, good Blunt, before thou go'st,
5157	Where is Lord Stanley quarter'd, dost thou know?
5158	
5159	BLUNT	Unless I have mista'en his colours much,
5160	Which well I am assured I have not done,
5161	His regiment lies half a mile at least
5162	South from the mighty power of the king.
5163	
5164	RICHMOND	If without peril it be possible,
5165	Good Captain Blunt, bear my good-night to him,
5166	And give him from me this most needful scroll.
5167	
5168	BLUNT	Upon my life, my lord, I'll under-take it;
5169	And so, God give you quiet rest to-night!
5170	
5171	RICHMOND	Good night, good Captain Blunt. Come gentlemen,
5172	Let us consult upon to-morrow's business
5173	In to our tent; the air is raw and cold.

5184	
5185	KING RICHARD III	                  I will not sup to-night.
5186	Give me some ink and paper.
5187	What, is my beaver easier than it was?
5188	And all my armour laid into my tent?
5189	
5190	CATESBY	If is, my liege; and all things are in readiness.
5191	
5192	KING RICHARD III	Good Norfolk, hie thee to thy charge;
5193	Use careful watch, choose trusty sentinels.
5194	
5195	NORFOLK	I go, my lord.
5196

5207	KING RICHARD III	Send out a pursuivant at arms
5208	To Stanley's regiment; bid him bring his power
5209	Before sunrising, lest his son George fall
5210	Into the blind cave of eternal night.
5211	
5212	[Exit CATESBY]
5213	
5214	Fill me a bowl of wine. Give me a watch.
5215	Saddle white Surrey for the field to-morrow.
5216	Look that my staves be sound, and not too heavy.
5217	Ratcliff!
5218	
5219	RATCLIFF	My lord?
5220	
5221	KING RICHARD III	Saw'st thou the melancholy Lord Northumberland?
5222	
5223	RATCLIFF	Thomas the Earl of Surrey, and himself,
5224	Much about cock-shut time, from troop to troop
5225	Went through the army, cheering up the soldiers.
5226	
5227	KING RICHARD III	So, I am satisfied. Give me a bowl of wine:
5228	I have not that alacrity of spirit,
5229	Nor cheer of mind, that I was wont to have.
5230	Set it down. Is ink and paper ready?
5231	
5232	RATCLIFF	It is, my lord.
5233	
5234	KING RICHARD III	                  Bid my guard watch; leave me.
5235	Ratcliff, about the mid of night come to my tent

5246	Be to thy person, noble father-in-law!
5247	Tell me, how fares our loving mother?
5248	
5249	DERBY	I, by attorney, bless thee from thy mother
5250	Who prays continually for Richmond's good:
5251	So much for that. The silent hours steal on,
5252	And flaky darkness breaks within the east.
5253	In brief,--for so the season bids us be,--
5254	Prepare thy battle early in the morning,
5255	And put thy fortune to the arbitrement
5256	Of bloody strokes and mortal-staring war.
5257	I, as I may--that which I would I cannot,--
5258	With best advantage will deceive the time,
5259	And aid thee in this doubtful shock of arms:
5260	But on thy side I may not be too forward
5261	Lest, being seen, thy brother, tender George,
5262	Be executed in his father's sight.
5263	Farewell: the leisure and the fearful time
5264	Cuts off the ceremonious vows of love
5265	And ample interchange of sweet discourse,
5266	Which so long sunder'd friends should dwell upon:
5267	God give us leisure for these rites of love!
5268	Once more, adieu: be valiant, and speed well!
5269	
5270	RICHMOND	Good lords, conduct him to his regiment:
5271	I'll strive, with troubled thoughts, to take a nap,
5272	Lest leaden slumber peise me down to-morrow,
5273	When I should mount with wings of victory:
5274	Once more, good night, kind lords and gentlemen.
5275	
5276	[Exeunt all but RICHMOND]
5277	
5278	O Thou, whose captain I account myself,
5279	Look on my forces with a gracious eye;
5280	Put in their hands thy bruising irons of wrath,
5281	That they may crush down with a heavy fall
5282	The usurping helmets of our adversaries!
5283	Make us thy ministers of chastisement,
5284	That we may praise thee in the victory!
5285	To thee I do commend my watchful soul,
5286	Ere I let fall the windows of mine eyes:
5287	Sleeping and waking, O, defend me still!

5298	At Tewksbury: despair, therefore, and die!

5316	[To RICHMOND]

5328	Poor Clarence, by thy guile betrayed to death!
5329	To-morrow in the battle think on me,
5330	And fall thy edgeless sword: despair, and die!--
5331	
5332	[To RICHMOND]
5333	
5334	Thou offspring of the house of Lancaster
5335	The wronged heirs of York do pray for thee
5336	Good angels guard thy battle! live, and flourish!

5415	Fainting, despair; despairing, yield thy breath!
5416	
5417	[To RICHMOND]
5418	
5419	I died for hope ere I could lend thee aid:
5420	But cheer thy heart, and be thou not dismay'd:
5421	God and good angel fight on Richmond's side;
5422	And Richard falls in height of all his pride.
5423	
5424	[The Ghosts vanish]
5425	
5426	[KING RICHARD III starts out of his dream]
5427	
5428	KING RICHARD III	Give me another horse: bind up my wounds.
5429	Have mercy, Jesu!--Soft! I did but dream.
5430	O coward conscience, how dost thou afflict me!
5431	The lights burn blue. It is now dead midnight.
5432	Cold fearful drops stand on my trembling flesh.
5433	What do I fear?  myself?  there's none else by:
5434	Richard loves Richard; that is, I am I.
5435	Is there a murderer here?  No. Yes, I am:
5436	Then fly. What, from myself?   Great reason why:
5437	Lest I revenge. What, myself upon myself?
5438	Alack. I love myself. Wherefore?  for any good
5439	That I myself have done unto myself?
5440	O, no! alas, I rather hate myself
5441	For hateful deeds committed by myself!
5442	I am a villain: yet I lie. I am not.
5443	Fool, of thyself speak well: fool, do not flatter.
5444	My conscience hath a thousand several tongues,
5445	And every tongue brings in a several tale,
5446	And every tale condemns me for a villain.
5447	Perjury, perjury, in the high'st degree
5448	Murder, stem murder, in the direst degree;
5449	All several sins, all used in each degree,
5450	Throng to the bar, crying all, Guilty! guilty!
5451	I shall despair. There is no creature loves me;
5452	And if I die, no soul shall pity me:
5453	Nay, wherefore should they, since that I myself
5454	Find in myself no pity to myself?
5455	Methought the souls of all that I had murder'd
5456	Came to my tent; and every one did threat
5457	To-morrow's vengeance on the head of Richard.
5458	
5459	[Enter RATCLIFF]
5460	
5461	RATCLIFF	My lord!
5462	
5463	KING RICHARD III	'Zounds! who is there?
5464	
5465	RATCLIFF	Ratcliff, my lord; 'tis I. The early village-cock
5466	Hath twice done salutation to the morn;
5467	Your friends are up, and buckle on their armour.
5468	
5469	KING RICHARD III	O Ratcliff, I have dream'd a fearful dream!
5470	What thinkest thou, will our friends prove all true?
5471	
5472	RATCLIFF	No doubt, my lord.
5473	
5474	KING RICHARD III	                  O Ratcliff, I fear, I fear,--
5475	
5476	RATCLIFF	Nay, good my lord, be not afraid of shadows.
5477	
5478	KING RICHARD III	By the apostle Paul, shadows to-night
5479	Have struck more terror to the soul of Richard
5480	Than can the substance of ten thousand soldiers
5481	Armed in proof, and led by shallow Richmond.
5482	It is not yet near day. Come, go with me;
5483	Under our tents I'll play the eaves-dropper,
5484	To see if any mean to shrink from me.
5485	
5486	[Exeunt]
5487	
5488	[Enter the Lords to RICHMOND, sitting in his tent]
5489	
5490	LORDS	Good morrow, Richmond!
5491	
5492	RICHMOND	Cry mercy, lords and watchful gentlemen,
5493	That you have ta'en a tardy sluggard here.
5494	
5495	LORDS	How have you slept, my lord?
5496	
5497	RICHMOND	The sweetest sleep, and fairest-boding dreams
5498	That ever enter'd in a drowsy head,
5499	Have I since your departure had, my lords.
5500	Methought their souls, whose bodies Richard murder'd,
5501	Came to my tent, and cried on victory:
5502	I promise you, my soul is very jocund
5503	In the remembrance of so fair a dream.
5504	How far into the morning is it, lords?
5505	
5506	LORDS	Upon the stroke of four.
5507	
5508	RICHMOND	Why, then 'tis time to arm and give direction.
5509	
5510	[His oration to his soldiers]
5511	
5512	More than I have said, loving countrymen,
5513	The leisure and enforcement of the time
5514	Forbids to dwell upon: yet remember this,
5515	God and our good cause fight upon our side;
5516	The prayers of holy saints and wronged souls,
5517	Like high-rear'd bulwarks, stand before our faces;
5518	Richard except, those whom we fight against
5519	Had rather have us win than him they follow:
5520	For what is he they follow?  truly, gentlemen,
5521	A bloody tyrant and a homicide;
5522	One raised in blood, and one in blood establish'd;
5523	One that made means to come by what he hath,
5524	And slaughter'd those that were the means to help him;
5525	Abase foul stone, made precious by the foil
5526	Of England's chair, where he is falsely set;
5527	One that hath ever been God's enemy:
5528	Then, if you fight against God's enemy,
5529	God will in justice ward you as his soldiers;
5530	If you do sweat to put a tyrant down,
5531	You sleep in peace, the tyrant being slain;
5532	If you do fight against your country's foes,
5533	Your country's fat shall pay your pains the hire;
5534	If you do fight in safeguard of your wives,
5535	Your wives shall welcome home the conquerors;
5536	If you do free your children from the sword,
5537	Your children's children quit it in your age.
5538	Then, in the name of God and all these rights,
5539	Advance your standards, draw your willing swords.
5540	For me, the ransom of my bold attempt
5541	Shall be this cold corpse on the earth's cold face;
5542	But if I thrive, the gain of my attempt
5543	The least of you shall share his part thereof.
5544	Sound drums and trumpets boldly and cheerfully;
5545	God and Saint George! Richmond and victory!
5546	
5547	[Exeunt]
5548	
5549	[Re-enter KING RICHARD, RATCLIFF, Attendants
5550	and Forces]
5551	
5552	KING RICHARD III	What said Northumberland as touching Richmond?
5553	
5554	RATCLIFF	That he was never trained up in arms.
5555	
5556	KING RICHARD III	He said the truth: and what said Surrey then?
5557	
5558	RATCLIFF	He smiled and said 'The better for our purpose.'
5559	
5560	KING RICHARD III	He was in the right; and so indeed it is.
5561	
5562	[Clock striketh]
5563	
5564	Ten the clock there. Give me a calendar.
5565	Who saw the sun to-day?
5566	
5567	RATCLIFF	Not I, my lord.
5568	
5569	KING RICHARD III	Then he disdains to shine; for by the book
5570	He should have braved the east an hour ago
5571	A black day will it be to somebody. Ratcliff!
5572	
5573	RATCLIFF	        My lord?
5574	
5575	KING RICHARD III	The sun will not be seen to-day;
5576	The sky doth frown and lour upon our army.
5577	I would these dewy tears were from the ground.
5578	Not shine to-day! Why, what is that to me
5579	More than to Richmond?  for the selfsame heaven
5580	That frowns on me looks sadly upon him.
5581	
5582	[Enter NORFOLK]
5583	
5584	NORFOLK	Arm, arm, my lord; the foe vaunts in the field.
5585	
5586	KING RICHARD III	Come, bustle, bustle; caparison my horse.
5587	Call up Lord Stanley, bid him bring his power:
5588	I will lead forth my soldiers to the plain,
5589	And thus my battle shall be ordered:
5590	My foreward shall be drawn out all in length,
5591	Consisting equally of horse and foot;
5592	Our archers shall be placed in the midst
5593	John Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Earl of Surrey,
5594	Shall have the leading of this foot and horse.
5595	They thus directed, we will follow
5596	In the main battle, whose puissance on either side
5597	Shall be well winged with our chiefest horse.
5598	This, and Saint George to boot! What think'st thou, Norfolk?
5599	
5600	NORFOLK	A good direction, warlike sovereign.
5601	This found I on my tent this morning.
5602	
5603	[He sheweth him a paper]
5604	
5605	KING RICHARD III	[Reads]
5606	
5607	'Jockey of Norfolk, be not too bold,
5608	For Dickon thy master is bought and sold.'
5609	A thing devised by the enemy.
5610	Go, gentleman, every man unto his charge
5611	Let not our babbling dreams affright our souls:
5612	Conscience is but a word that cowards use,
5613	Devised at first to keep the strong in awe:
5614	Our strong arms be our conscience, swords our law.
5615	March on, join bravely, let us to't pell-mell
5616	If not to heaven, then hand in hand to hell.
5617	
5618	[His oration to his Army]
5619	
5620	What shall I say more than I have inferr'd?
5621	Remember whom you are to cope withal;
5622	A sort of vagabonds, rascals, and runaways,
5623	A scum of Bretons, and base lackey peasants,
5624	Whom their o'er-cloyed country vomits forth
5625	To desperate ventures and assured destruction.
5626	You sleeping safe, they bring to you unrest;
5627	You having lands, and blest with beauteous wives,
5628	They would restrain the one, distain the other.
5629	And who doth lead them but a paltry fellow,
5630	Long kept in Bretagne at our mother's cost?
5631	A milk-sop, one that never in his life
5632	Felt so much cold as over shoes in snow?
5633	Let's whip these stragglers o'er the seas again;
5634	Lash hence these overweening rags of France,
5635	These famish'd beggars, weary of their lives;
5636	Who, but for dreaming on this fond exploit,
5637	For want of means, poor rats, had hang'd themselves:
5638	If we be conquer'd, let men conquer us,
5639	And not these bastard Bretons; whom our fathers
5640	Have in their own land beaten, bobb'd, and thump'd,
5641	And in record, left them the heirs of shame.
5642	Shall these enjoy our lands?  lie with our wives?
5643	Ravish our daughters?
5644	
5645	[Drum afar off]
5646	
5647	Hark! I hear their drum.
5648	Fight, gentlemen of England! fight, bold yoemen!
5649	Draw, archers, draw your arrows to the head!
5650	Spur your proud horses hard, and ride in blood;
5651	Amaze the welkin with your broken staves!
5652	
5653	[Enter a Messenger]
5654	
5655	What says Lord Stanley? will he bring his power?
5656	
5657	Messenger	My lord, he doth deny to come.
5658	
5659	KING RICHARD III	Off with his son George's head!
5660	
5661	NORFOLK	My lord, the enemy is past the marsh
5662	After the battle let George Stanley die.
5663	
5664	KING RICHARD III	A thousand hearts are great within my bosom:
5665	Advance our standards, set upon our foes
5666	Our ancient word of courage, fair Saint George,
5667	Inspire us with the spleen of fiery dragons!
5668	Upon them! victory sits on our helms.

5688	CATESBY	Rescue, my Lord of Norfolk, rescue, rescue!
5689	The king enacts more wonders than a man,
5690	Daring an opposite to every danger:
5691	His horse is slain, and all on foot he fights,
5692	Seeking for Richmond in the throat of death.
5693	Rescue, fair lord, or else the day is lost!
5694	
5695	[Alarums. Enter KING RICHARD III]

5697	KING RICHARD III	A horse! a horse! my kingdom for a horse!

5700	
5701	KING RICHARD III	Slave, I have set my life upon a cast,
5702	And I will stand the hazard of the die:
5703	I think there be six Richmonds in the field;

5726	
5727	RICHMOND	God and your arms be praised, victorious friends,
5728	The day is ours, the bloody dog is dead.
5729	
5730	DERBY	Courageous Richmond, well hast thou acquit thee.
5731	Lo, here, this long-usurped royalty
5732	From the dead temples of this bloody wretch
5733	Have I pluck'd off, to grace thy brows withal:
5734	Wear it, enjoy it, and make much of it.
5735	
5736	RICHMOND	Great God of heaven, say Amen to all!
5737	But, tell me, is young George Stanley living?
5738	
5739	DERBY	He is, my lord, and safe in Leicester town;
5740	Whither, if it please you, we may now withdraw us.
5741	
5742	RICHMOND	What men of name are slain on either side?

5747	RICHMOND	Inter their bodies as becomes their births:
5748	Proclaim a pardon to the soldiers fled
5749	That in submission will return to us:
5750	And then, as we have ta'en the sacrament,
5751	We will unite the white rose and the red:
5752	Smile heaven upon this fair conjunction,
5753	That long have frown'd upon their enmity!
5754	What traitor hears me, and says not amen?
5755	England hath long been mad, and scarr'd herself;
5756	The brother blindly shed the brother's blood,
5757	The father rashly slaughter'd his own son,
5758	The son, compell'd, been butcher to the sire:
5759	All this divided York and Lancaster,
5760	Divided in their dire division,
5761	O, now, let Richmond and Elizabeth,
5762	The true succeeders of each royal house,
5763	By God's fair ordinance conjoin together!
5764	And let their heirs, God, if thy will be so.
5765	Enrich the time to come with smooth-faced peace,
5766	With smiling plenty and fair prosperous days!
5767	Abate the edge of traitors, gracious Lord,
5768	That would reduce these bloody days again,
5769	And make poor England weep in streams of blood!

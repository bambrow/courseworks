7	TO THE
8	RIGHT HONORABLE HENRY WRIOTHESLY,
9	EARL OF SOUTHAMPTON, AND BARON OF TICHFIELD.
10	RIGHT HONORABLE,
11	
12	I KNOW not how I shall offend in dedicating my
13	unpolished lines to your lordship, nor how the world will
14	censure me for choosing so strong a prop to support so weak a
15	burden only, if your honour seem but pleased, I account
16	myself highly praised, and vow to take advantage of all idle
17	hours, till I have honoured you with some graver labour. But if
18	the first heir of my invention prove deformed, I shall be
19	sorry it had so noble a god-father, and never after ear so
20	barren a land, for fear it yield me still so bad a harvest.
21	I leave it to your honourable survey, and your honour to your
22	heart's content; which I wish may always answer your own wish
23	and the world's hopeful expectation.
24	
25	Your honour's in all duty,
26	WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE.

30	EVEN as the sun with purple-colour'd face
31	Had ta'en his last leave of the weeping morn,
32	Rose-cheek'd Adonis hied him to the chase;
33	Hunting he loved, but love he laugh'd to scorn;
34	Sick-thoughted Venus makes amain unto him,
35	And like a bold-faced suitor 'gins to woo him.
36	
37	'Thrice-fairer than myself,' thus she began,
38	'The field's chief flower, sweet above compare,
39	Stain to all nymphs, more lovely than a man,
40	More white and red than doves or roses are;
41	Nature that made thee, with herself at strife,
42	Saith that the world hath ending with thy life.
43	
44	'Vouchsafe, thou wonder, to alight thy steed,
45	And rein his proud head to the saddle-bow;
46	If thou wilt deign this favour, for thy meed
47	A thousand honey secrets shalt thou know:
48	Here come and sit, where never serpent hisses,
49	And being set, I'll smother thee with kisses;
50	
51	'And yet not cloy thy lips with loathed satiety,
52	But rather famish them amid their plenty,
53	Making them red and pale with fresh variety,
54	Ten kisses short as one, one long as twenty:
55	A summer's day will seem an hour but short,
56	Being wasted in such time-beguiling sport.'
57	
58	With this she seizeth on his sweating palm,
59	The precedent of pith and livelihood,
60	And trembling in her passion, calls it balm,
61	Earth's sovereign salve to do a goddess good:
62	Being so enraged, desire doth lend her force
63	Courageously to pluck him from his horse.
64	
65	Over one arm the lusty courser's rein,
66	Under her other was the tender boy,
67	Who blush'd and pouted in a dull disdain,
68	With leaden appetite, unapt to toy;
69	She red and hot as coals of glowing fire,
70	He red for shame, but frosty in desire.
71	
72	The studded bridle on a ragged bough
73	Nimbly she fastens:--O, how quick is love!--
74	The steed is stalled up, and even now
75	To tie the rider she begins to prove:
76	Backward she push'd him, as she would be thrust,
77	And govern'd him in strength, though not in lust.
78	
79	So soon was she along as he was down,
80	Each leaning on their elbows and their hips:
81	Now doth she stroke his cheek, now doth he frown,
82	And 'gins to chide, but soon she stops his lips;
83	And kissing speaks, with lustful language broken,
84	'If thou wilt chide, thy lips shall never open.'
85	
86	He burns with bashful shame: she with her tears
87	Doth quench the maiden burning of his cheeks;
88	Then with her windy sighs and golden hairs
89	To fan and blow them dry again she seeks:
90	He saith she is immodest, blames her 'miss;
91	What follows more she murders with a kiss.
92	
93	Even as an empty eagle, sharp by fast,
94	Tires with her beak on feathers, flesh and bone,
95	Shaking her wings, devouring all in haste,
96	Till either gorge be stuff'd or prey be gone;
97	Even so she kissed his brow, his cheek, his chin,
98	And where she ends she doth anew begin.
99	
100	Forced to content, but never to obey,
101	Panting he lies and breatheth in her face;
102	She feedeth on the steam as on a prey,
103	And calls it heavenly moisture, air of grace;
104	Wishing her cheeks were gardens full of flowers,
105	So they were dew'd with such distilling showers.
106	
107	Look, how a bird lies tangled in a net,
108	So fasten'd in her arms Adonis lies;
109	Pure shame and awed resistance made him fret,
110	Which bred more beauty in his angry eyes:
111	Rain added to a river that is rank
112	Perforce will force it overflow the bank.
113	
114	Still she entreats, and prettily entreats,
115	For to a pretty ear she tunes her tale;
116	Still is he sullen, still he lours and frets,
117	'Twixt crimson shame and anger ashy-pale:
118	Being red, she loves him best; and being white,
119	Her best is better'd with a more delight.
120	
121	Look how he can, she cannot choose but love;
122	And by her fair immortal hand she swears,
123	From his soft bosom never to remove,
124	Till he take truce with her contending tears,
125	Which long have rain'd, making her cheeks all wet;
126	And one sweet kiss shall pay this countless debt.
127	
128	Upon this promise did he raise his chin,
129	Like a dive-dapper peering through a wave,
130	Who, being look'd on, ducks as quickly in;
131	So offers he to give what she did crave;
132	But when her lips were ready for his pay,
133	He winks, and turns his lips another way.
134	
135	Never did passenger in summer's heat
136	More thirst for drink than she for this good turn.
137	Her help she sees, but help she cannot get;
138	She bathes in water, yet her fire must burn:
139	'O, pity,' 'gan she cry, 'flint-hearted boy!
140	'Tis but a kiss I beg; why art thou coy?
141	
142	'I have been woo'd, as I entreat thee now,
143	Even by the stern and direful god of war,
144	Whose sinewy neck in battle ne'er did bow,
145	Who conquers where he comes in every jar;
146	Yet hath he been my captive and my slave,
147	And begg'd for that which thou unask'd shalt have.
148	
149	'Over my altars hath he hung his lance,
150	His batter'd shield, his uncontrolled crest,
151	And for my sake hath learn'd to sport and dance,
152	To toy, to wanton, dally, smile and jest,
153	Scorning his churlish drum and ensign red,
154	Making my arms his field, his tent my bed.
155	
156	'Thus he that overruled I oversway'd,
157	Leading him prisoner in a red-rose chain:
158	Strong-tempered steel his stronger strength obey'd,
159	Yet was he servile to my coy disdain.
160	O, be not proud, nor brag not of thy might,
161	For mastering her that foil'd the god of fight!
162	
163	'Touch but my lips with those fair lips of thine,--
164	Though mine be not so fair, yet are they red--
165	The kiss shall be thine own as well as mine.
166	What seest thou in the ground? hold up thy head:
167	Look in mine eye-balls, there thy beauty lies;
168	Then why not lips on lips, since eyes in eyes?
169	'Art thou ashamed to kiss? then wink again,
170	And I will wink; so shall the day seem night;
171	Love keeps his revels where they are but twain;
172	Be bold to play, our sport is not in sight:
173	These blue-vein'd violets whereon we lean
174	Never can blab, nor know not what we mean.
175	
176	'The tender spring upon thy tempting lip
177	Shows thee unripe; yet mayst thou well be tasted:
178	Make use of time, let not advantage slip;
179	Beauty within itself should not be wasted:
180	Fair flowers that are not gather'd in their prime
181	Rot and consume themselves in little time.
182	
183	'Were I hard-favour'd, foul, or wrinkled-old,
184	Ill-nurtured, crooked, churlish, harsh in voice,
185	O'erworn, despised, rheumatic and cold,
186	Thick-sighted, barren, lean and lacking juice,
187	Then mightst thou pause, for then I were not for thee
188	But having no defects, why dost abhor me?
189	
190	'Thou canst not see one wrinkle in my brow;
191	Mine eyes are gray and bright and quick in turning:
192	My beauty as the spring doth yearly grow,
193	My flesh is soft and plump, my marrow burning;
194	My smooth moist hand, were it with thy hand felt,
195	Would in thy palm dissolve, or seem to melt.
196	
197	'Bid me discourse, I will enchant thine ear,
198	Or, like a fairy, trip upon the green,
199	Or, like a nymph, with long dishevell'd hair,
200	Dance on the sands, and yet no footing seen:
201	Love is a spirit all compact of fire,
202	Not gross to sink, but light, and will aspire.
203	
204	'Witness this primrose bank whereon I lie;
205	These forceless flowers like sturdy trees support me;
206	Two strengthless doves will draw me through the sky,
207	From morn till night, even where I list to sport me:
208	Is love so light, sweet boy, and may it be
209	That thou shouldst think it heavy unto thee?
210	
211	'Is thine own heart to thine own face affected?
212	Can thy right hand seize love upon thy left?
213	Then woo thyself, be of thyself rejected,
214	Steal thine own freedom and complain on theft.
215	Narcissus so himself himself forsook,
216	And died to kiss his shadow in the brook.
217	
218	'Torches are made to light, jewels to wear,
219	Dainties to taste, fresh beauty for the use,
220	Herbs for their smell, and sappy plants to bear:
221	Things growing to themselves are growth's abuse:
222	Seeds spring from seeds and beauty breedeth beauty;
223	Thou wast begot; to get it is thy duty.
224	
225	'Upon the earth's increase why shouldst thou feed,
226	Unless the earth with thy increase be fed?
227	By law of nature thou art bound to breed,
228	That thine may live when thou thyself art dead;
229	And so, in spite of death, thou dost survive,
230	In that thy likeness still is left alive.'
231	
232	By this the love-sick queen began to sweat,
233	For where they lay the shadow had forsook them,
234	And Titan, tired in the mid-day heat,
235	With burning eye did hotly overlook them;
236	Wishing Adonis had his team to guide,
237	So he were like him and by Venus' side.
238	
239	And now Adonis, with a lazy spright,
240	And with a heavy, dark, disliking eye,
241	His louring brows o'erwhelming his fair sight,
242	Like misty vapours when they blot the sky,
243	Souring his cheeks cries 'Fie, no more of love!
244	The sun doth burn my face: I must remove.'
245	
246	'Ay me,' quoth Venus, 'young, and so unkind?
247	What bare excuses makest thou to be gone!
248	I'll sigh celestial breath, whose gentle wind
249	Shall cool the heat of this descending sun:
250	I'll make a shadow for thee of my hairs;
251	If they burn too, I'll quench them with my tears.
252	
253	'The sun that shines from heaven shines but warm,
254	And, lo, I lie between that sun and thee:
255	The heat I have from thence doth little harm,
256	Thine eye darts forth the fire that burneth me;
257	And were I not immortal, life were done
258	Between this heavenly and earthly sun.
259	
260	'Art thou obdurate, flinty, hard as steel,
261	Nay, more than flint, for stone at rain relenteth?
262	Art thou a woman's son, and canst not feel
263	What 'tis to love? how want of love tormenteth?
264	O, had thy mother borne so hard a mind,
265	She had not brought forth thee, but died unkind.
266	
267	'What am I, that thou shouldst contemn me this?
268	Or what great danger dwells upon my suit?
269	What were thy lips the worse for one poor kiss?
270	Speak, fair; but speak fair words, or else be mute:
271	Give me one kiss, I'll give it thee again,
272	And one for interest, if thou wilt have twain.
273	
274	'Fie, lifeless picture, cold and senseless stone,
275	Well-painted idol, image dun and dead,
276	Statue contenting but the eye alone,
277	Thing like a man, but of no woman bred!
278	Thou art no man, though of a man's complexion,
279	For men will kiss even by their own direction.'
280	
281	This said, impatience chokes her pleading tongue,
282	And swelling passion doth provoke a pause;
283	Red cheeks and fiery eyes blaze forth he wrong;
284	Being judge in love, she cannot right her cause:
285	And now she weeps, and now she fain would speak,
286	And now her sobs do her intendments break.
287	
288	Sometimes she shakes her head and then his hand,
289	Now gazeth she on him, now on the ground;
290	Sometimes her arms infold him like a band:
291	She would, he will not in her arms be bound;
292	And when from thence he struggles to be gone,
293	She locks her lily fingers one in one.
294	
295	'Fondling,' she saith, 'since I have hemm'd thee here
296	Within the circuit of this ivory pale,
297	I'll be a park, and thou shalt be my deer;
298	Feed where thou wilt, on mountain or in dale:
299	Graze on my lips; and if those hills be dry,
300	Stray lower, where the pleasant fountains lie.
301	
302	Within this limit is relief enough,
303	Sweet bottom-grass and high delightful plain,
304	Round rising hillocks, brakes obscure and rough,
305	To shelter thee from tempest and from rain
306	Then be my deer, since I am such a park;
307	No dog shall rouse thee, though a thousand bark.'
308	
309	At this Adonis smiles as in disdain,
310	That in each cheek appears a pretty dimple:
311	Love made those hollows, if himself were slain,
312	He might be buried in a tomb so simple;
313	Foreknowing well, if there he came to lie,
314	Why, there Love lived and there he could not die.
315	
316	These lovely caves, these round enchanting pits,
317	Open'd their mouths to swallow Venus' liking.
318	Being mad before, how doth she now for wits?
319	Struck dead at first, what needs a second striking?
320	Poor queen of love, in thine own law forlorn,
321	To love a cheek that smiles at thee in scorn!
322	
323	Now which way shall she turn? what shall she say?
324	Her words are done, her woes are more increasing;
325	The time is spent, her object will away,
326	And from her twining arms doth urge releasing.
327	'Pity,' she cries, 'some favour, some remorse!'
328	Away he springs and hasteth to his horse.
329	
330	But, lo, from forth a copse that neighbors by,
331	A breeding jennet, lusty, young and proud,
332	Adonis' trampling courser doth espy,
333	And forth she rushes, snorts and neighs aloud:
334	The strong-neck'd steed, being tied unto a tree,
335	Breaketh his rein, and to her straight goes he.
336	
337	Imperiously he leaps, he neighs, he bounds,
338	And now his woven girths he breaks asunder;
339	The bearing earth with his hard hoof he wounds,
340	Whose hollow womb resounds like heaven's thunder;
341	The iron bit he crusheth 'tween his teeth,
342	Controlling what he was controlled with.
343	
344	His ears up-prick'd; his braided hanging mane
345	Upon his compass'd crest now stand on end;
346	His nostrils drink the air, and forth again,
347	As from a furnace, vapours doth he send:
348	His eye, which scornfully glisters like fire,
349	Shows his hot courage and his high desire.
350	
351	Sometime he trots, as if he told the steps,
352	With gentle majesty and modest pride;
353	Anon he rears upright, curvets and leaps,
354	As who should say 'Lo, thus my strength is tried,
355	And this I do to captivate the eye
356	Of the fair breeder that is standing by.'
357	
358	What recketh he his rider's angry stir,
359	His flattering 'Holla,' or his 'Stand, I say'?
360	What cares he now for curb or pricking spur?
361	For rich caparisons or trapping gay?
362	He sees his love, and nothing else he sees,
363	For nothing else with his proud sight agrees.
364	
365	Look, when a painter would surpass the life,
366	In limning out a well-proportion'd steed,
367	His art with nature's workmanship at strife,
368	As if the dead the living should exceed;
369	So did this horse excel a common one
370	In shape, in courage, colour, pace and bone.
371	
372	Round-hoof'd, short-jointed, fetlocks shag and long,
373	Broad breast, full eye, small head and nostril wide,
374	High crest, short ears, straight legs and passing strong,
375	Thin mane, thick tail, broad buttock, tender hide:
376	Look, what a horse should have he did not lack,
377	Save a proud rider on so proud a back.
378	
379	Sometime he scuds far off and there he stares;
380	Anon he starts at stirring of a feather;
381	To bid the wind a base he now prepares,
382	And whether he run or fly they know not whether;
383	For through his mane and tail the high wind sings,
384	Fanning the hairs, who wave like feather'd wings.
385	
386	He looks upon his love and neighs unto her;
387	She answers him as if she knew his mind:
388	Being proud, as females are, to see him woo her,
389	She puts on outward strangeness, seems unkind,
390	Spurns at his love and scorns the heat he feels,
391	Beating his kind embracements with her heels.
392	
393	Then, like a melancholy malcontent,
394	He veils his tail that, like a falling plume,
395	Cool shadow to his melting buttock lent:
396	He stamps and bites the poor flies in his fume.
397	His love, perceiving how he is enraged,
398	Grew kinder, and his fury was assuaged.
399	
400	His testy master goeth about to take him;
401	When, lo, the unback'd breeder, full of fear,
402	Jealous of catching, swiftly doth forsake him,
403	With her the horse, and left Adonis there:
404	As they were mad, unto the wood they hie them,
405	Out-stripping crows that strive to over-fly them.
406	
407	All swoln with chafing, down Adonis sits,
408	Banning his boisterous and unruly beast:
409	And now the happy season once more fits,
410	That love-sick Love by pleading may be blest;
411	For lovers say, the heart hath treble wrong
412	When it is barr'd the aidance of the tongue.
413	
414	An oven that is stopp'd, or river stay'd,
415	Burneth more hotly, swelleth with more rage:
416	So of concealed sorrow may be said;
417	Free vent of words love's fire doth assuage;
418	But when the heart's attorney once is mute,
419	The client breaks, as desperate in his suit.
420	
421	He sees her coming, and begins to glow,
422	Even as a dying coal revives with wind,
423	And with his bonnet hides his angry brow;
424	Looks on the dull earth with disturbed mind,
425	Taking no notice that she is so nigh,
426	For all askance he holds her in his eye.
427	
428	O, what a sight it was, wistly to view
429	How she came stealing to the wayward boy!
430	To note the fighting conflict of her hue,
431	How white and red each other did destroy!
432	But now her cheek was pale, and by and by
433	It flash'd forth fire, as lightning from the sky.
434	
435	Now was she just before him as he sat,
436	And like a lowly lover down she kneels;
437	With one fair hand she heaveth up his hat,
438	Her other tender hand his fair cheek feels:
439	His tenderer cheek receives her soft hand's print,
440	As apt as new-fall'n snow takes any dint.
441	
442	O, what a war of looks was then between them!
443	Her eyes petitioners to his eyes suing;
444	His eyes saw her eyes as they had not seen them;
445	Her eyes woo'd still, his eyes disdain'd the wooing:
446	And all this dumb play had his acts made plain
447	With tears, which, chorus-like, her eyes did rain.
448	
449	Full gently now she takes him by the hand,
450	A lily prison'd in a gaol of snow,
451	Or ivory in an alabaster band;
452	So white a friend engirts so white a foe:
453	This beauteous combat, wilful and unwilling,
454	Show'd like two silver doves that sit a-billing.
455	
456	Once more the engine of her thoughts began:
457	'O fairest mover on this mortal round,
458	Would thou wert as I am, and I a man,
459	My heart all whole as thine, thy heart my wound;
460	For one sweet look thy help I would assure thee,
461	Though nothing but my body's bane would cure thee!
462	
463	'Give me my hand,' saith he, 'why dost thou feel it?'
464	'Give me my heart,' saith she, 'and thou shalt have it:
465	O, give it me, lest thy hard heart do steel it,
466	And being steel'd, soft sighs can never grave it:
467	Then love's deep groans I never shall regard,
468	Because Adonis' heart hath made mine hard.'
469	
470	'For shame,' he cries, 'let go, and let me go;
471	My day's delight is past, my horse is gone,
472	And 'tis your fault I am bereft him so:
473	I pray you hence, and leave me here alone;
474	For all my mind, my thought, my busy care,
475	Is how to get my palfrey from the mare.'
476	
477	Thus she replies: 'Thy palfrey, as he should,
478	Welcomes the warm approach of sweet desire:
479	Affection is a coal that must be cool'd;
480	Else, suffer'd, it will set the heart on fire:
481	The sea hath bounds, but deep desire hath none;
482	Therefore no marvel though thy horse be gone.
483	
484	'How like a jade he stood, tied to the tree,
485	Servilely master'd with a leathern rein!
486	But when he saw his love, his youth's fair fee,
487	He held such petty bondage in disdain;
488	Throwing the base thong from his bending crest,
489	Enfranchising his mouth, his back, his breast.
490	
491	'Who sees his true-love in her naked bed,
492	Teaching the sheets a whiter hue than white,
493	But, when his glutton eye so full hath fed,
494	His other agents aim at like delight?
495	Who is so faint, that dare not be so bold
496	To touch the fire, the weather being cold?
497	
498	'Let me excuse thy courser, gentle boy;
499	And learn of him, I heartily beseech thee,
500	To take advantage on presented joy;
501	Though I were dumb, yet his proceedings teach thee;
502	O, learn to love; the lesson is but plain,
503	And once made perfect, never lost again.'
504	
505	I know not love,' quoth he, 'nor will not know it,
506	Unless it be a boar, and then I chase it;
507	'Tis much to borrow, and I will not owe it;
508	My love to love is love but to disgrace it;
509	For I have heard it is a life in death,
510	That laughs and weeps, and all but with a breath.
511	
512	'Who wears a garment shapeless and unfinish'd?
513	Who plucks the bud before one leaf put forth?
514	If springing things be any jot diminish'd,
515	They wither in their prime, prove nothing worth:
516	The colt that's back'd and burden'd being young
517	Loseth his pride and never waxeth strong.
518	
519	'You hurt my hand with wringing; let us part,
520	And leave this idle theme, this bootless chat:
521	Remove your siege from my unyielding heart;
522	To love's alarms it will not ope the gate:
523	Dismiss your vows, your feigned tears, your flattery;
524	For where a heart is hard they make no battery.'
525	
526	'What! canst thou talk?' quoth she, 'hast thou a tongue?
527	O, would thou hadst not, or I had no hearing!
528	Thy mermaid's voice hath done me double wrong;
529	I had my load before, now press'd with bearing:
530	Melodious discord, heavenly tune harshsounding,
531	Ear's deep-sweet music, and heart's deep-sore wounding.
532	
533	'Had I no eyes but ears, my ears would love
534	That inward beauty and invisible;
535	Or were I deaf, thy outward parts would move
536	Each part in me that were but sensible:
537	Though neither eyes nor ears, to hear nor see,
538	Yet should I be in love by touching thee.
539	
540	'Say, that the sense of feeling were bereft me,
541	And that I could not see, nor hear, nor touch,
542	And nothing but the very smell were left me,
543	Yet would my love to thee be still as much;
544	For from the stillitory of thy face excelling
545	Comes breath perfumed that breedeth love by
546	smelling.
547	
548	'But, O, what banquet wert thou to the taste,
549	Being nurse and feeder of the other four!
550	Would they not wish the feast might ever last,
551	And bid Suspicion double-lock the door,
552	Lest Jealousy, that sour unwelcome guest,
553	Should, by his stealing in, disturb the feast?'
554	
555	Once more the ruby-colour'd portal open'd,
556	Which to his speech did honey passage yield;
557	Like a red morn, that ever yet betoken'd
558	Wreck to the seaman, tempest to the field,
559	Sorrow to shepherds, woe unto the birds,
560	Gusts and foul flaws to herdmen and to herds.
561	
562	This ill presage advisedly she marketh:
563	Even as the wind is hush'd before it raineth,
564	Or as the wolf doth grin before he barketh,
565	Or as the berry breaks before it staineth,
566	Or like the deadly bullet of a gun,
567	His meaning struck her ere his words begun.
568	
569	And at his look she flatly falleth down,
570	For looks kill love and love by looks reviveth;
571	A smile recures the wounding of a frown;
572	But blessed bankrupt, that by love so thriveth!
573	The silly boy, believing she is dead,
574	Claps her pale cheek, till clapping makes it red;
575	
576	And all amazed brake off his late intent,
577	For sharply he did think to reprehend her,
578	Which cunning love did wittily prevent:
579	Fair fall the wit that can so well defend her!
580	For on the grass she lies as she were slain,
581	Till his breath breatheth life in her again.
582	
583	He wrings her nose, he strikes her on the cheeks,
584	He bends her fingers, holds her pulses hard,
585	He chafes her lips; a thousand ways he seeks
586	To mend the hurt that his unkindness marr'd:
587	He kisses her; and she, by her good will,
588	Will never rise, so he will kiss her still.
589	
590	The night of sorrow now is turn'd to day:
591	Her two blue windows faintly she up-heaveth,
592	Like the fair sun, when in his fresh array
593	He cheers the morn and all the earth relieveth;
594	And as the bright sun glorifies the sky,
595	So is her face illumined with her eye;
596	
597	Whose beams upon his hairless face are fix'd,
598	As if from thence they borrow'd all their shine.
599	Were never four such lamps together mix'd,
600	Had not his clouded with his brow's repine;
601	But hers, which through the crystal tears gave light,
602	Shone like the moon in water seen by night.
603	
604	'O, where am I?' quoth she, 'in earth or heaven,
605	Or in the ocean drench'd, or in the fire?
606	What hour is this? or morn or weary even?
607	Do I delight to die, or life desire?
608	But now I lived, and life was death's annoy;
609	But now I died, and death was lively joy.
610	
611	'O, thou didst kill me: kill me once again:
612	Thy eyes' shrewd tutor, that hard heart of thine,
613	Hath taught them scornful tricks and such disdain
614	That they have murder'd this poor heart of mine;
615	And these mine eyes, true leaders to their queen,
616	But for thy piteous lips no more had seen.
617	
618	'Long may they kiss each other, for this cure!
619	O, never let their crimson liveries wear!
620	And as they last, their verdure still endure,
621	To drive infection from the dangerous year!
622	That the star-gazers, having writ on death,
623	May say, the plague is banish'd by thy breath.
624	
625	'Pure lips, sweet seals in my soft lips imprinted,
626	What bargains may I make, still to be sealing?
627	To sell myself I can be well contented,
628	So thou wilt buy and pay and use good dealing;
629	Which purchase if thou make, for fear of slips
630	Set thy seal-manual on my wax-red lips.
631	
632	'A thousand kisses buys my heart from me;
633	And pay them at thy leisure, one by one.
634	What is ten hundred touches unto thee?
635	Are they not quickly told and quickly gone?
636	Say, for non-payment that the debt should double,
637	Is twenty hundred kisses such a trouble?
638	
639	'Fair queen,' quoth he, 'if any love you owe me,
640	Measure my strangeness with my unripe years:
641	Before I know myself, seek not to know me;
642	No fisher but the ungrown fry forbears:
643	The mellow plum doth fall, the green sticks fast,
644	Or being early pluck'd is sour to taste.
645	
646	'Look, the world's comforter, with weary gait,
647	His day's hot task hath ended in the west;
648	The owl, night's herald, shrieks, ''Tis very late;'
649	The sheep are gone to fold, birds to their nest,
650	And coal-black clouds that shadow heaven's light
651	Do summon us to part and bid good night.
652	
653	'Now let me say 'Good night,' and so say you;
654	If you will say so, you shall have a kiss.'
655	'Good night,' quoth she, and, ere he says 'Adieu,'
656	The honey fee of parting tender'd is:
657	Her arms do lend his neck a sweet embrace;
658	Incorporate then they seem; face grows to face.
659	
660	Till, breathless, he disjoin'd, and backward drew
661	The heavenly moisture, that sweet coral mouth,
662	Whose precious taste her thirsty lips well knew,
663	Whereon they surfeit, yet complain on drouth:
664	He with her plenty press'd, she faint with dearth
665	Their lips together glued, fall to the earth.
666	
667	Now quick desire hath caught the yielding prey,
668	And glutton-like she feeds, yet never filleth;
669	Her lips are conquerors, his lips obey,
670	Paying what ransom the insulter willeth;
671	Whose vulture thought doth pitch the price so high,
672	That she will draw his lips' rich treasure dry:
673	
674	And having felt the sweetness of the spoil,
675	With blindfold fury she begins to forage;
676	Her face doth reek and smoke, her blood doth boil,
677	And careless lust stirs up a desperate courage,
678	Planting oblivion, beating reason back,
679	Forgetting shame's pure blush and honour's wrack.
680	
681	Hot, faint, and weary, with her hard embracing,
682	Like a wild bird being tamed with too much handling,
683	Or as the fleet-foot roe that's tired with chasing,
684	Or like the froward infant still'd with dandling,
685	He now obeys, and now no more resisteth,
686	While she takes all she can, not all she listeth.
687	
688	What wax so frozen but dissolves with tempering,
689	And yields at last to every light impression?
690	Things out of hope are compass'd oft with venturing,
691	Chiefly in love, whose leave exceeds commission:
692	Affection faints not like a pale-faced coward,
693	But then woos best when most his choice is froward.
694	
695	When he did frown, O, had she then gave over,
696	Such nectar from his lips she had not suck'd.
697	Foul words and frowns must not repel a lover;
698	What though the rose have prickles, yet 'tis pluck'd:
699	Were beauty under twenty locks kept fast,
700	Yet love breaks through and picks them all at last.
701	
702	For pity now she can no more detain him;
703	The poor fool prays her that he may depart:
704	She is resolved no longer to restrain him;
705	Bids him farewell, and look well to her heart,
706	The which, by Cupid's bow she doth protest,
707	He carries thence incaged in his breast.
708	
709	'Sweet boy,' she says, 'this night I'll waste in sorrow,
710	For my sick heart commands mine eyes to watch.
711	Tell me, Love's master, shall we meet to-morrow?
712	Say, shall we? shall we? wilt thou make the match?'
713	He tells her, no; to-morrow he intends
714	To hunt the boar with certain of his friends.
715	
716	'The boar!' quoth she; whereat a sudden pale,
717	Like lawn being spread upon the blushing rose,
718	Usurps her cheek; she trembles at his tale,
719	And on his neck her yoking arms she throws:
720	She sinketh down, still hanging by his neck,
721	He on her belly falls, she on her back.
722	
723	Now is she in the very lists of love,
724	Her champion mounted for the hot encounter:
725	All is imaginary she doth prove,
726	He will not manage her, although he mount her;
727	That worse than Tantalus' is her annoy,
728	To clip Elysium and to lack her joy.
729	
730	Even as poor birds, deceived with painted grapes,
731	Do surfeit by the eye and pine the maw,
732	Even so she languisheth in her mishaps,
733	As those poor birds that helpless berries saw.
734	The warm effects which she in him finds missing
735	She seeks to kindle with continual kissing.
736	
737	But all in vain; good queen, it will not be:
738	She hath assay'd as much as may be proved;
739	Her pleading hath deserved a greater fee;
740	She's Love, she loves, and yet she is not loved.
741	'Fie, fie,' he says, 'you crush me; let me go;
742	You have no reason to withhold me so.'
743	
744	'Thou hadst been gone,' quoth she, 'sweet boy, ere this,
745	But that thou told'st me thou wouldst hunt the boar.
746	O, be advised! thou know'st not what it is
747	With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore,
748	Whose tushes never sheathed he whetteth still,
749	Like to a mortal butcher bent to kill.
750	
751	'On his bow-back he hath a battle set
752	Of bristly pikes, that ever threat his foes;
753	His eyes, like glow-worms, shine when he doth fret;
754	His snout digs sepulchres where'er he goes;
755	Being moved, he strikes whate'er is in his way,
756	And whom he strikes his cruel tushes slay.
757	
758	'His brawny sides, with hairy bristles arm'd,
759	Are better proof than thy spear's point can enter;
760	His short thick neck cannot be easily harm'd;
761	Being ireful, on the lion he will venture:
762	The thorny brambles and embracing bushes,
763	As fearful of him, part, through whom he rushes.
764	
765	'Alas, he nought esteems that face of thine,
766	To which Love's eyes pay tributary gazes;
767	Nor thy soft hands, sweet lips and crystal eyne,
768	Whose full perfection all the world amazes;
769	But having thee at vantage,--wondrous dread!--
770	Would root these beauties as he roots the mead.
771	
772	'O, let him keep his loathsome cabin still;
773	Beauty hath nought to do with such foul fiends:
774	Come not within his danger by thy will;
775	They that thrive well take counsel of their friends.
776	When thou didst name the boar, not to dissemble,
777	I fear'd thy fortune, and my joints did tremble.
778	
779	'Didst thou not mark my face? was it not white?
780	Saw'st thou not signs of fear lurk in mine eye?
781	Grew I not faint? and fell I not downright?
782	Within my bosom, whereon thou dost lie,
783	My boding heart pants, beats, and takes no rest,
784	But, like an earthquake, shakes thee on my breast.
785	
786	'For where Love reigns, disturbing Jealousy
787	Doth call himself Affection's sentinel;
788	Gives false alarms, suggesteth mutiny,
789	And in a peaceful hour doth cry 'Kill, kill!'
790	Distempering gentle Love in his desire,
791	As air and water do abate the fire.
792	
793	'This sour informer, this bate-breeding spy,
794	This canker that eats up Love's tender spring,
795	This carry-tale, dissentious Jealousy,
796	That sometime true news, sometime false doth bring,
797	Knocks at my heat and whispers in mine ear
798	That if I love thee, I thy death should fear:
799	
800	'And more than so, presenteth to mine eye
801	The picture of an angry-chafing boar,
802	Under whose sharp fangs on his back doth lie
803	An image like thyself, all stain'd with gore;
804	Whose blood upon the fresh flowers being shed
805	Doth make them droop with grief and hang the head.
806	
807	'What should I do, seeing thee so indeed,
808	That tremble at the imagination?
809	The thought of it doth make my faint heart bleed,
810	And fear doth teach it divination:
811	I prophesy thy death, my living sorrow,
812	If thou encounter with the boar to-morrow.
813	
814	'But if thou needs wilt hunt, be ruled by me;
815	Uncouple at the timorous flying hare,
816	Or at the fox which lives by subtlety,
817	Or at the roe which no encounter dare:
818	Pursue these fearful creatures o'er the downs,
819	And on thy well-breath'd horse keep with thy
820	hounds.
821	
822	'And when thou hast on foot the purblind hare,
823	Mark the poor wretch, to overshoot his troubles
824	How he outruns the wind and with what care
825	He cranks and crosses with a thousand doubles:
826	The many musets through the which he goes
827	Are like a labyrinth to amaze his foes.
828	
829	'Sometime he runs among a flock of sheep,
830	To make the cunning hounds mistake their smell,
831	And sometime where earth-delving conies keep,
832	To stop the loud pursuers in their yell,
833	And sometime sorteth with a herd of deer:
834	Danger deviseth shifts; wit waits on fear:
835	
836	'For there his smell with others being mingled,
837	The hot scent-snuffing hounds are driven to doubt,
838	Ceasing their clamorous cry till they have singled
839	With much ado the cold fault cleanly out;
840	Then do they spend their mouths: Echo replies,
841	As if another chase were in the skies.
842	
843	'By this, poor Wat, far off upon a hill,
844	Stands on his hinder legs with listening ear,
845	To harken if his foes pursue him still:
846	Anon their loud alarums he doth hear;
847	And now his grief may be compared well
848	To one sore sick that hears the passing-bell.
849	
850	'Then shalt thou see the dew-bedabbled wretch
851	Turn, and return, indenting with the way;
852	Each envious brier his weary legs doth scratch,
853	Each shadow makes him stop, each murmur stay:
854	For misery is trodden on by many,
855	And being low never relieved by any.
856	
857	'Lie quietly, and hear a little more;
858	Nay, do not struggle, for thou shalt not rise:
859	To make thee hate the hunting of the boar,
860	Unlike myself thou hear'st me moralize,
861	Applying this to that, and so to so;
862	For love can comment upon every woe.
863	
864	'Where did I leave?' 'No matter where,' quoth he,
865	'Leave me, and then the story aptly ends:
866	The night is spent.' 'Why, what of that?' quoth she.
867	'I am,' quoth he, 'expected of my friends;
868	And now 'tis dark, and going I shall fall.'
869	'In night,' quoth she, 'desire sees best of all
870	
871	'But if thou fall, O, then imagine this,
872	The earth, in love with thee, thy footing trips,
873	And all is but to rob thee of a kiss.
874	Rich preys make true men thieves; so do thy lips
875	Make modest Dian cloudy and forlorn,
876	Lest she should steal a kiss and die forsworn.
877	
878	'Now of this dark night I perceive the reason:
879	Cynthia for shame obscures her silver shine,
880	Till forging Nature be condemn'd of treason,
881	For stealing moulds from heaven that were divine;
882	Wherein she framed thee in high heaven's despite,
883	To shame the sun by day and her by night.
884	
885	'And therefore hath she bribed the Destinies
886	To cross the curious workmanship of nature,
887	To mingle beauty with infirmities,
888	And pure perfection with impure defeature,
889	Making it subject to the tyranny
890	Of mad mischances and much misery;
891	
892	'As burning fevers, agues pale and faint,
893	Life-poisoning pestilence and frenzies wood,
894	The marrow-eating sickness, whose attaint
895	Disorder breeds by heating of the blood:
896	Surfeits, imposthumes, grief, and damn'd despair,
897	Swear nature's death for framing thee so fair.
898	
899	'And not the least of all these maladies
900	But in one minute's fight brings beauty under:
901	Both favour, savour, hue and qualities,
902	Whereat the impartial gazer late did wonder,
903	Are on the sudden wasted, thaw'd and done,
904	As mountain-snow melts with the midday sun.
905	
906	'Therefore, despite of fruitless chastity,
907	Love-lacking vestals and self-loving nuns,
908	That on the earth would breed a scarcity
909	And barren dearth of daughters and of sons,
910	Be prodigal: the lamp that burns by night
911	Dries up his oil to lend the world his light.
912	
913	'What is thy body but a swallowing grave,
914	Seeming to bury that posterity
915	Which by the rights of time thou needs must have,
916	If thou destroy them not in dark obscurity?
917	If so, the world will hold thee in disdain,
918	Sith in thy pride so fair a hope is slain.
919	
920	'So in thyself thyself art made away;
921	A mischief worse than civil home-bred strife,
922	Or theirs whose desperate hands themselves do slay,
923	Or butcher-sire that reaves his son of life.
924	Foul-cankering rust the hidden treasure frets,
925	But gold that's put to use more gold begets.'
926	
927	'Nay, then,' quoth Adon, 'you will fall again
928	Into your idle over-handled theme:
929	The kiss I gave you is bestow'd in vain,
930	And all in vain you strive against the stream;
931	For, by this black-faced night, desire's foul nurse,
932	Your treatise makes me like you worse and worse.
933	
934	'If love have lent you twenty thousand tongues,
935	And every tongue more moving than your own,
936	Bewitching like the wanton mermaid's songs,
937	Yet from mine ear the tempting tune is blown
938	For know, my heart stands armed in mine ear,
939	And will not let a false sound enter there;
940	
941	'Lest the deceiving harmony should run
942	Into the quiet closure of my breast;
943	And then my little heart were quite undone,
944	In his bedchamber to be barr'd of rest.
945	No, lady, no; my heart longs not to groan,
946	But soundly sleeps, while now it sleeps alone.
947	
948	'What have you urged that I cannot reprove?
949	The path is smooth that leadeth on to danger:
950	I hate not love, but your device in love,
951	That lends embracements unto every stranger.
952	You do it for increase: O strange excuse,
953	When reason is the bawd to lust's abuse!
954	
955	'Call it not love, for Love to heaven is fled,
956	Since sweating Lust on earth usurp'd his name;
957	Under whose simple semblance he hath fed
958	Upon fresh beauty, blotting it with blame;
959	Which the hot tyrant stains and soon bereaves,
960	As caterpillars do the tender leaves.
961	
962	'Love comforteth like sunshine after rain,
963	But Lust's effect is tempest after sun;
964	Love's gentle spring doth always fresh remain,
965	Lust's winter comes ere summer half be done;
966	Love surfeits not, Lust like a glutton dies;
967	Love is all truth, Lust full of forged lies.
968	
969	'More I could tell, but more I dare not say;
970	The text is old, the orator too green.
971	Therefore, in sadness, now I will away;
972	My face is full of shame, my heart of teen:
973	Mine ears, that to your wanton talk attended,
974	Do burn themselves for having so offended.'
975	
976	With this, he breaketh from the sweet embrace,
977	Of those fair arms which bound him to her breast,
978	And homeward through the dark laund runs apace;
979	Leaves Love upon her back deeply distress'd.
980	Look, how a bright star shooteth from the sky,
981	So glides he in the night from Venus' eye.
982	
983	Which after him she darts, as one on shore
984	Gazing upon a late-embarked friend,
985	Till the wild waves will have him seen no more,
986	Whose ridges with the meeting clouds contend:
987	So did the merciless and pitchy night
988	Fold in the object that did feed her sight.
989	
990	Whereat amazed, as one that unaware
991	Hath dropp'd a precious jewel in the flood,
992	Or stonish'd as night-wanderers often are,
993	Their light blown out in some mistrustful wood,
994	Even so confounded in the dark she lay,
995	Having lost the fair discovery of her way.
996	
997	And now she beats her heart, whereat it groans,
998	That all the neighbour caves, as seeming troubled,
999	Make verbal repetition of her moans;
1000	Passion on passion deeply is redoubled:
1001	'Ay me!' she cries, and twenty times 'Woe, woe!'
1002	And twenty echoes twenty times cry so.
1003	
1004	She marking them begins a wailing note
1005	And sings extemporally a woeful ditty;
1006	How love makes young men thrall and old men dote;
1007	How love is wise in folly, foolish-witty:
1008	Her heavy anthem still concludes in woe,
1009	And still the choir of echoes answer so.
1010	
1011	Her song was tedious and outwore the night,
1012	For lovers' hours are long, though seeming short:
1013	If pleased themselves, others, they think, delight
1014	In such-like circumstance, with suchlike sport:
1015	Their copious stories oftentimes begun
1016	End without audience and are never done.
1017	
1018	For who hath she to spend the night withal
1019	But idle sounds resembling parasites,
1020	Like shrill-tongued tapsters answering every call,
1021	Soothing the humour of fantastic wits?
1022	She says ''Tis so:' they answer all ''Tis so;'
1023	And would say after her, if she said 'No.'
1024	
1025	Lo, here the gentle lark, weary of rest,
1026	From his moist cabinet mounts up on high,
1027	And wakes the morning, from whose silver breast
1028	The sun ariseth in his majesty;
1029	Who doth the world so gloriously behold
1030	That cedar-tops and hills seem burnish'd gold.
1031	
1032	Venus salutes him with this fair good-morrow:
1033	'O thou clear god, and patron of all light,
1034	From whom each lamp and shining star doth borrow
1035	The beauteous influence that makes him bright,
1036	There lives a son that suck'd an earthly mother,
1037	May lend thee light, as thou dost lend to other.'
1038	
1039	This said, she hasteth to a myrtle grove,
1040	Musing the morning is so much o'erworn,
1041	And yet she hears no tidings of her love:
1042	She hearkens for his hounds and for his horn:
1043	Anon she hears them chant it lustily,
1044	And all in haste she coasteth to the cry.
1045	
1046	And as she runs, the bushes in the way
1047	Some catch her by the neck, some kiss her face,
1048	Some twine about her thigh to make her stay:
1049	She wildly breaketh from their strict embrace,
1050	Like a milch doe, whose swelling dugs do ache,
1051	Hasting to feed her fawn hid in some brake.
1052	
1053	By this, she hears the hounds are at a bay;
1054	Whereat she starts, like one that spies an adder
1055	Wreathed up in fatal folds just in his way,
1056	The fear whereof doth make him shake and shudder;
1057	Even so the timorous yelping of the hounds
1058	Appals her senses and her spirit confounds.
1059	
1060	For now she knows it is no gentle chase,
1061	But the blunt boar, rough bear, or lion proud,
1062	Because the cry remaineth in one place,
1063	Where fearfully the dogs exclaim aloud:
1064	Finding their enemy to be so curst,
1065	They all strain courtesy who shall cope him first.
1066	
1067	This dismal cry rings sadly in her ear,
1068	Through which it enters to surprise her heart;
1069	Who, overcome by doubt and bloodless fear,
1070	With cold-pale weakness numbs each feeling part:
1071	Like soldiers, when their captain once doth yield,
1072	They basely fly and dare not stay the field.
1073	
1074	Thus stands she in a trembling ecstasy;
1075	Till, cheering up her senses all dismay'd,
1076	She tells them 'tis a causeless fantasy,
1077	And childish error, that they are afraid;
1078	Bids them leave quaking, bids them fear no more:--
1079	And with that word she spied the hunted boar,
1080	
1081	Whose frothy mouth, bepainted all with red,
1082	Like milk and blood being mingled both together,
1083	A second fear through all her sinews spread,
1084	Which madly hurries her she knows not whither:
1085	This way runs, and now she will no further,
1086	But back retires to rate the boar for murther.
1087	
1088	A thousand spleens bear her a thousand ways;
1089	She treads the path that she untreads again;
1090	Her more than haste is mated with delays,
1091	Like the proceedings of a drunken brain,
1092	Full of respects, yet nought at all respecting;
1093	In hand with all things, nought at all effecting.
1094	
1095	Here kennell'd in a brake she finds a hound,
1096	And asks the weary caitiff for his master,
1097	And there another licking of his wound,
1098	'Gainst venom'd sores the only sovereign plaster;
1099	And here she meets another sadly scowling,
1100	To whom she speaks, and he replies with howling.
1101	
1102	When he hath ceased his ill-resounding noise,
1103	Another flap-mouth'd mourner, black and grim,
1104	Against the welkin volleys out his voice;
1105	Another and another answer him,
1106	Clapping their proud tails to the ground below,
1107	Shaking their scratch'd ears, bleeding as they go.
1108	
1109	Look, how the world's poor people are amazed
1110	At apparitions, signs and prodigies,
1111	Whereon with fearful eyes they long have gazed,
1112	Infusing them with dreadful prophecies;
1113	So she at these sad signs draws up her breath
1114	And sighing it again, exclaims on Death.
1115	
1116	'Hard-favour'd tyrant, ugly, meagre, lean,
1117	Hateful divorce of love,'--thus chides she Death,--
1118	'Grim-grinning ghost, earth's worm, what dost thou mean
1119	To stifle beauty and to steal his breath,
1120	Who when he lived, his breath and beauty set
1121	Gloss on the rose, smell to the violet?
1122	
1123	'If he be dead,--O no, it cannot be,
1124	Seeing his beauty, thou shouldst strike at it:--
1125	O yes, it may; thou hast no eyes to see,
1126	But hatefully at random dost thou hit.
1127	Thy mark is feeble age, but thy false dart
1128	Mistakes that aim and cleaves an infant's heart.
1129	
1130	'Hadst thou but bid beware, then he had spoke,
1131	And, hearing him, thy power had lost his power.
1132	The Destinies will curse thee for this stroke;
1133	They bid thee crop a weed, thou pluck'st a flower:
1134	Love's golden arrow at him should have fled,
1135	And not Death's ebon dart, to strike dead.
1136	
1137	'Dost thou drink tears, that thou provokest such weeping?
1138	What may a heavy groan advantage thee?
1139	Why hast thou cast into eternal sleeping
1140	Those eyes that taught all other eyes to see?
1141	Now Nature cares not for thy mortal vigour,
1142	Since her best work is ruin'd with thy rigour.'
1143	
1144	Here overcome, as one full of despair,
1145	She vail'd her eyelids, who, like sluices, stopt
1146	The crystal tide that from her two cheeks fair
1147	In the sweet channel of her bosom dropt;
1148	But through the flood-gates breaks the silver rain,
1149	And with his strong course opens them again.
1150	
1151	O, how her eyes and tears did lend and borrow!
1152	Her eyes seen in the tears, tears in her eye;
1153	Both crystals, where they view'd each other's sorrow,
1154	Sorrow that friendly sighs sought still to dry;
1155	But like a stormy day, now wind, now rain,
1156	Sighs dry her cheeks, tears make them wet again.
1157	
1158	Variable passions throng her constant woe,
1159	As striving who should best become her grief;
1160	All entertain'd, each passion labours so,
1161	That every present sorrow seemeth chief,
1162	But none is best: then join they all together,
1163	Like many clouds consulting for foul weather.
1164	
1165	By this, far off she hears some huntsman hollo;
1166	A nurse's song ne'er pleased her babe so well:
1167	The dire imagination she did follow
1168	This sound of hope doth labour to expel;
1169	For now reviving joy bids her rejoice,
1170	And flatters her it is Adonis' voice.
1171	
1172	Whereat her tears began to turn their tide,
1173	Being prison'd in her eye like pearls in glass;
1174	Yet sometimes falls an orient drop beside,
1175	Which her cheek melts, as scorning it should pass,
1176	To wash the foul face of the sluttish ground,
1177	Who is but drunken when she seemeth drown'd.
1178	
1179	O hard-believing love, how strange it seems
1180	Not to believe, and yet too credulous!
1181	Thy weal and woe are both of them extremes;
1182	Despair and hope makes thee ridiculous:
1183	The one doth flatter thee in thoughts unlikely,
1184	In likely thoughts the other kills thee quickly.
1185	
1186	Now she unweaves the web that she hath wrought;
1187	Adonis lives, and Death is not to blame;
1188	It was not she that call'd him, all-to naught:
1189	Now she adds honours to his hateful name;
1190	She clepes him king of graves and grave for kings,
1191	Imperious supreme of all mortal things.
1192	
1193	'No, no,' quoth she, 'sweet Death, I did but jest;
1194	Yet pardon me I felt a kind of fear
1195	When as I met the boar, that bloody beast,
1196	Which knows no pity, but is still severe;
1197	Then, gentle shadow,--truth I must confess,--
1198	I rail'd on thee, fearing my love's decease.
1199	
1200	''Tis not my fault: the boar provoked my tongue;
1201	Be wreak'd on him, invisible commander;
1202	'Tis he, foul creature, that hath done thee wrong;
1203	I did but act, he's author of thy slander:
1204	Grief hath two tongues, and never woman yet
1205	Could rule them both without ten women's wit.'
1206	
1207	Thus hoping that Adonis is alive,
1208	Her rash suspect she doth extenuate;
1209	And that his beauty may the better thrive,
1210	With Death she humbly doth insinuate;
1211	Tells him of trophies, statues, tombs, and stories
1212	His victories, his triumphs and his glories.
1213	
1214	'O Jove,' quoth she, 'how much a fool was I
1215	To be of such a weak and silly mind
1216	To wail his death who lives and must not die
1217	Till mutual overthrow of mortal kind!
1218	For he being dead, with him is beauty slain,
1219	And, beauty dead, black chaos comes again.
1220	
1221	'Fie, fie, fond love, thou art so full of fear
1222	As one with treasure laden, hemm'd thieves;
1223	Trifles, unwitnessed with eye or ear,
1224	Thy coward heart with false bethinking grieves.'
1225	Even at this word she hears a merry horn,
1226	Whereat she leaps that was but late forlorn.
1227	
1228	As falcon to the lure, away she flies;
1229	The grass stoops not, she treads on it so light;
1230	And in her haste unfortunately spies
1231	The foul boar's conquest on her fair delight;
1232	Which seen, her eyes, as murder'd with the view,
1233	Like stars ashamed of day, themselves withdrew;
1234	
1235	Or, as the snail, whose tender horns being hit,
1236	Shrinks backward in his shelly cave with pain,
1237	And there, all smother'd up, in shade doth sit,
1238	Long after fearing to creep forth again;
1239	So, at his bloody view, her eyes are fled
1240	Into the deep dark cabins of her head:
1241	
1242	Where they resign their office and their light
1243	To the disposing of her troubled brain;
1244	Who bids them still consort with ugly night,
1245	And never wound the heart with looks again;
1246	Who like a king perplexed in his throne,
1247	By their suggestion gives a deadly groan,
1248	
1249	Whereat each tributary subject quakes;
1250	As when the wind, imprison'd in the ground,
1251	Struggling for passage, earth's foundation shakes,
1252	Which with cold terror doth men's minds confound.
1253	This mutiny each part doth so surprise
1254	That from their dark beds once more leap her eyes;
1255	
1256	And, being open'd, threw unwilling light
1257	Upon the wide wound that the boar had trench'd
1258	In his soft flank; whose wonted lily white
1259	With purple tears, that his wound wept, was drench'd:
1260	No flower was nigh, no grass, herb, leaf, or weed,
1261	But stole his blood and seem'd with him to bleed.
1262	
1263	This solemn sympathy poor Venus noteth;
1264	Over one shoulder doth she hang her head;
1265	Dumbly she passions, franticly she doteth;
1266	She thinks he could not die, he is not dead:
1267	Her voice is stopt, her joints forget to bow;
1268	Her eyes are mad that they have wept til now.
1269	
1270	Upon his hurt she looks so steadfastly,
1271	That her sight dazzling makes the wound seem three;
1272	And then she reprehends her mangling eye,
1273	That makes more gashes where no breach should be:
1274	His face seems twain, each several limb is doubled;
1275	For oft the eye mistakes, the brain being troubled.
1276	
1277	'My tongue cannot express my grief for one,
1278	And yet,' quoth she, 'behold two Adons dead!
1279	My sighs are blown away, my salt tears gone,
1280	Mine eyes are turn'd to fire, my heart to lead:
1281	Heavy heart's lead, melt at mine eyes' red fire!
1282	So shall I die by drops of hot desire.
1283	
1284	'Alas, poor world, what treasure hast thou lost!
1285	What face remains alive that's worth the viewing?
1286	Whose tongue is music now? what canst thou boast
1287	Of things long since, or any thing ensuing?
1288	The flowers are sweet, their colours fresh and trim;
1289	But true-sweet beauty lived and died with him.
1290	
1291	'Bonnet nor veil henceforth no creature wear!
1292	Nor sun nor wind will ever strive to kiss you:
1293	Having no fair to lose, you need not fear;
1294	The sun doth scorn you and the wind doth hiss you:
1295	But when Adonis lived, sun and sharp air
1296	Lurk'd like two thieves, to rob him of his fair:
1297	
1298	'And therefore would he put his bonnet on,
1299	Under whose brim the gaudy sun would peep;
1300	The wind would blow it off and, being gone,
1301	Play with his locks: then would Adonis weep;
1302	And straight, in pity of his tender years,
1303	They both would strive who first should dry his tears.
1304	
1305	'To see his face the lion walk'd along
1306	Behind some hedge, because he would not fear him;
1307	To recreate himself when he hath sung,
1308	The tiger would be tame and gently hear him;
1309	If he had spoke, the wolf would leave his prey
1310	And never fright the silly lamb that day.
1311	
1312	'When he beheld his shadow in the brook,
1313	The fishes spread on it their golden gills;
1314	When he was by, the birds such pleasure took,
1315	That some would sing, some other in their bills
1316	Would bring him mulberries and ripe-red cherries;
1317	He fed them with his sight, they him with berries.
1318	
1319	'But this foul, grim, and urchin-snouted boar,
1320	Whose downward eye still looketh for a grave,
1321	Ne'er saw the beauteous livery that he wore;
1322	Witness the entertainment that he gave:
1323	If he did see his face, why then I know
1324	He thought to kiss him, and hath kill'd him so.
1325	
1326	''Tis true, 'tis true; thus was Adonis slain:
1327	He ran upon the boar with his sharp spear,
1328	Who did not whet his teeth at him again,
1329	But by a kiss thought to persuade him there;
1330	And nuzzling in his flank, the loving swine
1331	Sheathed unaware the tusk in his soft groin.
1332	
1333	'Had I been tooth'd like him, I must confess,
1334	With kissing him I should have kill'd him first;
1335	But he is dead, and never did he bless
1336	My youth with his; the more am I accurst.'
1337	With this, she falleth in the place she stood,
1338	And stains her face with his congealed blood.
1339	
1340	She looks upon his lips, and they are pale;
1341	She takes him by the hand, and that is cold;
1342	She whispers in his ears a heavy tale,
1343	As if they heard the woeful words she told;
1344	She lifts the coffer-lids that close his eyes,
1345	Where, lo, two lamps, burnt out, in darkness lies;
1346	
1347	Two glasses, where herself herself beheld
1348	A thousand times, and now no more reflect;
1349	Their virtue lost, wherein they late excell'd,
1350	And every beauty robb'd of his effect:
1351	'Wonder of time,' quoth she, 'this is my spite,
1352	That, thou being dead, the day should yet be light.
1353	
1354	'Since thou art dead, lo, here I prophesy:
1355	Sorrow on love hereafter shall attend:
1356	It shall be waited on with jealousy,
1357	Find sweet beginning, but unsavoury end,
1358	Ne'er settled equally, but high or low,
1359	That all love's pleasure shall not match his woe.
1360	
1361	'It shall be fickle, false and full of fraud,
1362	Bud and be blasted in a breathing-while;
1363	The bottom poison, and the top o'erstraw'd
1364	With sweets that shall the truest sight beguile:
1365	The strongest body shall it make most weak,
1366	Strike the wise dumb and teach the fool to speak.
1367	
1368	'It shall be sparing and too full of riot,
1369	Teaching decrepit age to tread the measures;
1370	The staring ruffian shall it keep in quiet,
1371	Pluck down the rich, enrich the poor with treasures;
1372	It shall be raging-mad and silly-mild,
1373	Make the young old, the old become a child.
1374	
1375	'It shall suspect where is no cause of fear;
1376	It shall not fear where it should most mistrust;
1377	It shall be merciful and too severe,
1378	And most deceiving when it seems most just;
1379	Perverse it shall be where it shows most toward,
1380	Put fear to valour, courage to the coward.
1381	
1382	'It shall be cause of war and dire events,
1383	And set dissension 'twixt the son and sire;
1384	Subject and servile to all discontents,
1385	As dry combustious matter is to fire:
1386	Sith in his prime Death doth my love destroy,
1387	They that love best their loves shall not enjoy.'
1388	
1389	By this, the boy that by her side lay kill'd
1390	Was melted like a vapour from her sight,
1391	And in his blood that on the ground lay spill'd,
1392	A purple flower sprung up, chequer'd with white,
1393	Resembling well his pale cheeks and the blood
1394	Which in round drops upon their whiteness stood.
1395	
1396	She bows her head, the new-sprung flower to smell,
1397	Comparing it to her Adonis' breath,
1398	And says, within her bosom it shall dwell,
1399	Since he himself is reft from her by death:
1400	She crops the stalk, and in the breach appears
1401	Green dropping sap, which she compares to tears.
1402	
1403	'Poor flower,' quoth she, 'this was thy fathers guise--
1404	Sweet issue of a more sweet-smelling sire--
1405	For every little grief to wet his eyes:
1406	To grow unto himself was his desire,
1407	And so 'tis thine; but know, it is as good
1408	To wither in my breast as in his blood.
1409	
1410	'Here was thy father's bed, here in my breast;
1411	Thou art the next of blood, and 'tis thy right:
1412	Lo, in this hollow cradle take thy rest,
1413	My throbbing heart shall rock thee day and night:
1414	There shall not be one minute in an hour
1415	Wherein I will not kiss my sweet love's flower.'
1416	
1417	Thus weary of the world, away she hies,
1418	And yokes her silver doves; by whose swift aid
1419	Their mistress mounted through the empty skies
1420	In her light chariot quickly is convey'd;
1421	Holding their course to Paphos, where their queen
1422	Means to immure herself and not be seen.

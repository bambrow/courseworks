63	ACT I
64	
65	
66	
67	SCENE I	On a ship at sea: a tempestuous noise
68	of thunder and lightning heard.
69	
70	
71	[Enter a Master and a Boatswain]
72	
73	Master	Boatswain!
74	
75	Boatswain	Here, master: what cheer?
76	
77	Master	Good, speak to the mariners: fall to't, yarely,
78	or we run ourselves aground: bestir, bestir.
79	
80	[Exit]
81	
82	[Enter Mariners]
83	
84	Boatswain	Heigh, my hearts! cheerly, cheerly, my hearts!
85	yare, yare! Take in the topsail. Tend to the
86	master's whistle. Blow, till thou burst thy wind,
87	if room enough!
88	
89	[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, FERDINAND,
90	GONZALO, and others]
91	
92	ALONSO	Good boatswain, have care. Where's the master?
93	Play the men.
94	
95	Boatswain	I pray now, keep below.
96	
97	ANTONIO	Where is the master, boatswain?
98	
99	Boatswain	Do you not hear him? You mar our labour: keep your
100	cabins: you do assist the storm.
101	
102	GONZALO	Nay, good, be patient.
103	
104	Boatswain	When the sea is. Hence! What cares these roarers
105	for the name of king? To cabin: silence! trouble us not.
106	
107	GONZALO	Good, yet remember whom thou hast aboard.
108	
109	Boatswain	None that I more love than myself. You are a
110	counsellor; if you can command these elements to
111	silence, and work the peace of the present, we will
112	not hand a rope more; use your authority: if you
113	cannot, give thanks you have lived so long, and make
114	yourself ready in your cabin for the mischance of
115	the hour, if it so hap. Cheerly, good hearts! Out
116	of our way, I say.
117	
118	[Exit]
119	
120	GONZALO	I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he
121	hath no drowning mark upon him; his complexion is
122	perfect gallows. Stand fast, good Fate, to his
123	hanging: make the rope of his destiny our cable,
124	for our own doth little advantage. If he be not
125	born to be hanged, our case is miserable.
126	
127	[Exeunt]
128	
129	[Re-enter Boatswain]
130	
131	Boatswain	Down with the topmast! yare! lower, lower! Bring
132	her to try with main-course.
133	
134	[A cry within]
135	
136	A plague upon this howling! they are louder than
137	the weather or our office.
138	
139	[Re-enter SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, and GONZALO]
140	
141	Yet again! what do you here? Shall we give o'er
142	and drown? Have you a mind to sink?
143	
144	SEBASTIAN	A pox o' your throat, you bawling, blasphemous,
145	incharitable dog!
146	
147	Boatswain	Work you then.
148	
149	ANTONIO	Hang, cur! hang, you whoreson, insolent noisemaker!
150	We are less afraid to be drowned than thou art.
151	
152	GONZALO	I'll warrant him for drowning; though the ship were
153	no stronger than a nutshell and as leaky as an
154	unstanched wench.
155	
156	Boatswain	Lay her a-hold, a-hold! set her two courses off to
157	sea again; lay her off.
158	
159	[Enter Mariners wet]
160	
161	Mariners	All lost! to prayers, to prayers! all lost!
162	
163	Boatswain	What, must our mouths be cold?
164	
165	GONZALO	The king and prince at prayers! let's assist them,
166	For our case is as theirs.
167	
168	SEBASTIAN	I'm out of patience.
169	
170	ANTONIO	We are merely cheated of our lives by drunkards:
171	This wide-chapp'd rascal--would thou mightst lie drowning
172	The washing of ten tides!
173	
174	GONZALO	He'll be hang'd yet,
175	Though every drop of water swear against it
176	And gape at widest to glut him.
177	
178	[A confused noise within:   'Mercy on us!'--
179	'We split, we split!'--'Farewell, my wife and
180	children!'--
181	'Farewell, brother!'--'We split, we split, we split!']
182	
183	ANTONIO	Let's all sink with the king.
184	
185	SEBASTIAN	Let's take leave of him.
186	
187	[Exeunt ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]
188	
189	GONZALO	Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an
190	acre of barren ground, long heath, brown furze, any
191	thing. The wills above be done! but I would fain
192	die a dry death.
193	
194	[Exeunt]

199	THE TEMPEST
200	
201	
202	ACT I
203	
204	
205	
206	SCENE II	The island. Before PROSPERO'S cell.
207	
208	
209	[Enter PROSPERO and MIRANDA]
210	
211	MIRANDA	If by your art, my dearest father, you have
212	Put the wild waters in this roar, allay them.
213	The sky, it seems, would pour down stinking pitch,
214	But that the sea, mounting to the welkin's cheek,
215	Dashes the fire out. O, I have suffered
216	With those that I saw suffer: a brave vessel,
217	Who had, no doubt, some noble creature in her,
218	Dash'd all to pieces. O, the cry did knock
219	Against my very heart. Poor souls, they perish'd.
220	Had I been any god of power, I would
221	Have sunk the sea within the earth or ere
222	It should the good ship so have swallow'd and
223	The fraughting souls within her.
224	
225	PROSPERO	Be collected:
226	No more amazement: tell your piteous heart
227	There's no harm done.
228	
229	MIRANDA	O, woe the day!
230	
231	PROSPERO	No harm.
232	I have done nothing but in care of thee,
233	Of thee, my dear one, thee, my daughter, who
234	Art ignorant of what thou art, nought knowing
235	Of whence I am, nor that I am more better
236	Than Prospero, master of a full poor cell,
237	And thy no greater father.
238	
239	MIRANDA	More to know
240	Did never meddle with my thoughts.
241	
242	PROSPERO	'Tis time
243	I should inform thee farther. Lend thy hand,
244	And pluck my magic garment from me. So:
245	
246	[Lays down his mantle]
247	
248	Lie there, my art. Wipe thou thine eyes; have comfort.
249	The direful spectacle of the wreck, which touch'd
250	The very virtue of compassion in thee,
251	I have with such provision in mine art
252	So safely ordered that there is no soul--
253	No, not so much perdition as an hair
254	Betid to any creature in the vessel
255	Which thou heard'st cry, which thou saw'st sink. Sit down;
256	For thou must now know farther.
257	
258	MIRANDA	You have often
259	Begun to tell me what I am, but stopp'd
260	And left me to a bootless inquisition,
261	Concluding 'Stay: not yet.'
262	
263	PROSPERO	The hour's now come;
264	The very minute bids thee ope thine ear;
265	Obey and be attentive. Canst thou remember
266	A time before we came unto this cell?
267	I do not think thou canst, for then thou wast not
268	Out three years old.
269	
270	MIRANDA	Certainly, sir, I can.
271	
272	PROSPERO	By what? by any other house or person?
273	Of any thing the image tell me that
274	Hath kept with thy remembrance.
275	
276	MIRANDA	'Tis far off
277	And rather like a dream than an assurance
278	That my remembrance warrants. Had I not
279	Four or five women once that tended me?
280	
281	PROSPERO	Thou hadst, and more, Miranda. But how is it
282	That this lives in thy mind? What seest thou else
283	In the dark backward and abysm of time?
284	If thou remember'st aught ere thou camest here,
285	How thou camest here thou mayst.
286	
287	MIRANDA	But that I do not.
288	
289	PROSPERO	Twelve year since, Miranda, twelve year since,
290	Thy father was the Duke of Milan and
291	A prince of power.
292	
293	MIRANDA	                  Sir, are not you my father?
294	
295	PROSPERO	Thy mother was a piece of virtue, and
296	She said thou wast my daughter; and thy father
297	Was Duke of Milan; and thou his only heir
298	And princess no worse issued.
299	
300	MIRANDA	O the heavens!
301	What foul play had we, that we came from thence?
302	Or blessed was't we did?
303	
304	PROSPERO	Both, both, my girl:
305	By foul play, as thou say'st, were we heaved thence,
306	But blessedly holp hither.
307	
308	MIRANDA	O, my heart bleeds
309	To think o' the teen that I have turn'd you to,
310	Which is from my remembrance! Please you, farther.
311	
312	PROSPERO	My brother and thy uncle, call'd Antonio--
313	I pray thee, mark me--that a brother should
314	Be so perfidious!--he whom next thyself
315	Of all the world I loved and to him put
316	The manage of my state; as at that time
317	Through all the signories it was the first
318	And Prospero the prime duke, being so reputed
319	In dignity, and for the liberal arts
320	Without a parallel; those being all my study,
321	The government I cast upon my brother
322	And to my state grew stranger, being transported
323	And rapt in secret studies. Thy false uncle--
324	Dost thou attend me?
325	
326	MIRANDA	Sir, most heedfully.
327	
328	PROSPERO	Being once perfected how to grant suits,
329	How to deny them, who to advance and who
330	To trash for over-topping, new created
331	The creatures that were mine, I say, or changed 'em,
332	Or else new form'd 'em; having both the key
333	Of officer and office, set all hearts i' the state
334	To what tune pleased his ear; that now he was
335	The ivy which had hid my princely trunk,
336	And suck'd my verdure out on't. Thou attend'st not.
337	
338	MIRANDA	O, good sir, I do.
339	
340	PROSPERO	                  I pray thee, mark me.
341	I, thus neglecting worldly ends, all dedicated
342	To closeness and the bettering of my mind
343	With that which, but by being so retired,
344	O'er-prized all popular rate, in my false brother
345	Awaked an evil nature; and my trust,
346	Like a good parent, did beget of him
347	A falsehood in its contrary as great
348	As my trust was; which had indeed no limit,
349	A confidence sans bound. He being thus lorded,
350	Not only with what my revenue yielded,
351	But what my power might else exact, like one
352	Who having into truth, by telling of it,
353	Made such a sinner of his memory,
354	To credit his own lie, he did believe
355	He was indeed the duke; out o' the substitution
356	And executing the outward face of royalty,
357	With all prerogative: hence his ambition growing--
358	Dost thou hear?
359	
360	MIRANDA	                  Your tale, sir, would cure deafness.
361	
362	PROSPERO	To have no screen between this part he play'd
363	And him he play'd it for, he needs will be
364	Absolute Milan. Me, poor man, my library
365	Was dukedom large enough: of temporal royalties
366	He thinks me now incapable; confederates--
367	So dry he was for sway--wi' the King of Naples
368	To give him annual tribute, do him homage,
369	Subject his coronet to his crown and bend
370	The dukedom yet unbow'd--alas, poor Milan!--
371	To most ignoble stooping.
372	
373	MIRANDA	O the heavens!
374	
375	PROSPERO	Mark his condition and the event; then tell me
376	If this might be a brother.
377	
378	MIRANDA	I should sin
379	To think but nobly of my grandmother:
380	Good wombs have borne bad sons.
381	
382	PROSPERO	Now the condition.
383	The King of Naples, being an enemy
384	To me inveterate, hearkens my brother's suit;
385	Which was, that he, in lieu o' the premises
386	Of homage and I know not how much tribute,
387	Should presently extirpate me and mine
388	Out of the dukedom and confer fair Milan
389	With all the honours on my brother: whereon,
390	A treacherous army levied, one midnight
391	Fated to the purpose did Antonio open
392	The gates of Milan, and, i' the dead of darkness,
393	The ministers for the purpose hurried thence
394	Me and thy crying self.
395	
396	MIRANDA	Alack, for pity!
397	I, not remembering how I cried out then,
398	Will cry it o'er again: it is a hint
399	That wrings mine eyes to't.
400	
401	PROSPERO	Hear a little further
402	And then I'll bring thee to the present business
403	Which now's upon's; without the which this story
404	Were most impertinent.
405	
406	MIRANDA	Wherefore did they not
407	That hour destroy us?
408	
409	PROSPERO	Well demanded, wench:
410	My tale provokes that question. Dear, they durst not,
411	So dear the love my people bore me, nor set
412	A mark so bloody on the business, but
413	With colours fairer painted their foul ends.
414	In few, they hurried us aboard a bark,
415	Bore us some leagues to sea; where they prepared
416	A rotten carcass of a boat, not rigg'd,
417	Nor tackle, sail, nor mast; the very rats
418	Instinctively had quit it: there they hoist us,
419	To cry to the sea that roar'd to us, to sigh
420	To the winds whose pity, sighing back again,
421	Did us but loving wrong.
422	
423	MIRANDA	Alack, what trouble
424	Was I then to you!
425	
426	PROSPERO	                  O, a cherubim
427	Thou wast that did preserve me. Thou didst smile.
428	Infused with a fortitude from heaven,
429	When I have deck'd the sea with drops full salt,
430	Under my burthen groan'd; which raised in me
431	An undergoing stomach, to bear up
432	Against what should ensue.
433	
434	MIRANDA	How came we ashore?
435	
436	PROSPERO	By Providence divine.
437	Some food we had and some fresh water that
438	A noble Neapolitan, Gonzalo,
439	Out of his charity, being then appointed
440	Master of this design, did give us, with
441	Rich garments, linens, stuffs and necessaries,
442	Which since have steaded much; so, of his gentleness,
443	Knowing I loved my books, he furnish'd me
444	From mine own library with volumes that
445	I prize above my dukedom.
446	
447	MIRANDA	Would I might
448	But ever see that man!
449	
450	PROSPERO	Now I arise:
451	
452	[Resumes his mantle]
453	
454	Sit still, and hear the last of our sea-sorrow.
455	Here in this island we arrived; and here
456	Have I, thy schoolmaster, made thee more profit
457	Than other princesses can that have more time
458	For vainer hours and tutors not so careful.
459	
460	MIRANDA	Heavens thank you for't! And now, I pray you, sir,
461	For still 'tis beating in my mind, your reason
462	For raising this sea-storm?
463	
464	PROSPERO	Know thus far forth.
465	By accident most strange, bountiful Fortune,
466	Now my dear lady, hath mine enemies
467	Brought to this shore; and by my prescience
468	I find my zenith doth depend upon
469	A most auspicious star, whose influence
470	If now I court not but omit, my fortunes
471	Will ever after droop. Here cease more questions:
472	Thou art inclined to sleep; 'tis a good dulness,
473	And give it way: I know thou canst not choose.
474	
475	[MIRANDA sleeps]
476	
477	Come away, servant, come. I am ready now.
478	Approach, my Ariel, come.
479	
480	[Enter ARIEL]
481	
482	ARIEL	All hail, great master! grave sir, hail! I come
483	To answer thy best pleasure; be't to fly,
484	To swim, to dive into the fire, to ride
485	On the curl'd clouds, to thy strong bidding task
486	Ariel and all his quality.
487	
488	PROSPERO	Hast thou, spirit,
489	Perform'd to point the tempest that I bade thee?
490	
491	ARIEL	To every article.
492	I boarded the king's ship; now on the beak,
493	Now in the waist, the deck, in every cabin,
494	I flamed amazement: sometime I'ld divide,
495	And burn in many places; on the topmast,
496	The yards and bowsprit, would I flame distinctly,
497	Then meet and join. Jove's lightnings, the precursors
498	O' the dreadful thunder-claps, more momentary
499	And sight-outrunning were not; the fire and cracks
500	Of sulphurous roaring the most mighty Neptune
501	Seem to besiege and make his bold waves tremble,
502	Yea, his dread trident shake.
503	
504	PROSPERO	My brave spirit!
505	Who was so firm, so constant, that this coil
506	Would not infect his reason?
507	
508	ARIEL	Not a soul
509	But felt a fever of the mad and play'd
510	Some tricks of desperation. All but mariners
511	Plunged in the foaming brine and quit the vessel,
512	Then all afire with me: the king's son, Ferdinand,
513	With hair up-staring,--then like reeds, not hair,--
514	Was the first man that leap'd; cried, 'Hell is empty
515	And all the devils are here.'
516	
517	PROSPERO	Why that's my spirit!
518	But was not this nigh shore?
519	
520	ARIEL	Close by, my master.
521	
522	PROSPERO	But are they, Ariel, safe?
523	
524	ARIEL	Not a hair perish'd;
525	On their sustaining garments not a blemish,
526	But fresher than before: and, as thou badest me,
527	In troops I have dispersed them 'bout the isle.
528	The king's son have I landed by himself;
529	Whom I left cooling of the air with sighs
530	In an odd angle of the isle and sitting,
531	His arms in this sad knot.
532	
533	PROSPERO	Of the king's ship
534	The mariners say how thou hast disposed
535	And all the rest o' the fleet.
536	
537	ARIEL	Safely in harbour
538	Is the king's ship; in the deep nook, where once
539	Thou call'dst me up at midnight to fetch dew
540	From the still-vex'd Bermoothes, there she's hid:
541	The mariners all under hatches stow'd;
542	Who, with a charm join'd to their suffer'd labour,
543	I have left asleep; and for the rest o' the fleet
544	Which I dispersed, they all have met again
545	And are upon the Mediterranean flote,
546	Bound sadly home for Naples,
547	Supposing that they saw the king's ship wreck'd
548	And his great person perish.
549	
550	PROSPERO	Ariel, thy charge
551	Exactly is perform'd: but there's more work.
552	What is the time o' the day?
553	
554	ARIEL	Past the mid season.
555	
556	PROSPERO	At least two glasses. The time 'twixt six and now
557	Must by us both be spent most preciously.
558	
559	ARIEL	Is there more toil? Since thou dost give me pains,
560	Let me remember thee what thou hast promised,
561	Which is not yet perform'd me.
562	
563	PROSPERO	How now? moody?
564	What is't thou canst demand?
565	
566	ARIEL	My liberty.
567	
568	PROSPERO	Before the time be out? no more!
569	
570	ARIEL	I prithee,
571	Remember I have done thee worthy service;
572	Told thee no lies, made thee no mistakings, served
573	Without or grudge or grumblings: thou didst promise
574	To bate me a full year.
575	
576	PROSPERO	Dost thou forget
577	From what a torment I did free thee?
578	
579	ARIEL	No.
580	
581	PROSPERO	Thou dost, and think'st it much to tread the ooze
582	Of the salt deep,
583	To run upon the sharp wind of the north,
584	To do me business in the veins o' the earth
585	When it is baked with frost.
586	
587	ARIEL	I do not, sir.
588	
589	PROSPERO	Thou liest, malignant thing! Hast thou forgot
590	The foul witch Sycorax, who with age and envy
591	Was grown into a hoop? hast thou forgot her?
592	
593	ARIEL	No, sir.
594	
595	PROSPERO	     Thou hast. Where was she born? speak; tell me.
596	
597	ARIEL	Sir, in Argier.
598	
599	PROSPERO	                  O, was she so? I must
600	Once in a month recount what thou hast been,
601	Which thou forget'st. This damn'd witch Sycorax,
602	For mischiefs manifold and sorceries terrible
603	To enter human hearing, from Argier,
604	Thou know'st, was banish'd: for one thing she did
605	They would not take her life. Is not this true?
606	
607	ARIEL	Ay, sir.
608	
609	PROSPERO	This blue-eyed hag was hither brought with child
610	And here was left by the sailors. Thou, my slave,
611	As thou report'st thyself, wast then her servant;
612	And, for thou wast a spirit too delicate
613	To act her earthy and abhorr'd commands,
614	Refusing her grand hests, she did confine thee,
615	By help of her more potent ministers
616	And in her most unmitigable rage,
617	Into a cloven pine; within which rift
618	Imprison'd thou didst painfully remain
619	A dozen years; within which space she died
620	And left thee there; where thou didst vent thy groans
621	As fast as mill-wheels strike. Then was this island--
622	Save for the son that she did litter here,
623	A freckled whelp hag-born--not honour'd with
624	A human shape.
625	
626	ARIEL	                  Yes, Caliban her son.
627	
628	PROSPERO	Dull thing, I say so; he, that Caliban
629	Whom now I keep in service. Thou best know'st
630	What torment I did find thee in; thy groans
631	Did make wolves howl and penetrate the breasts
632	Of ever angry bears: it was a torment
633	To lay upon the damn'd, which Sycorax
634	Could not again undo: it was mine art,
635	When I arrived and heard thee, that made gape
636	The pine and let thee out.
637	
638	ARIEL	I thank thee, master.
639	
640	PROSPERO	If thou more murmur'st, I will rend an oak
641	And peg thee in his knotty entrails till
642	Thou hast howl'd away twelve winters.
643	
644	ARIEL	Pardon, master;
645	I will be correspondent to command
646	And do my spiriting gently.
647	
648	PROSPERO	Do so, and after two days
649	I will discharge thee.
650	
651	ARIEL	That's my noble master!
652	What shall I do? say what; what shall I do?
653	
654	PROSPERO	Go make thyself like a nymph o' the sea: be subject
655	To no sight but thine and mine, invisible
656	To every eyeball else. Go take this shape
657	And hither come in't: go, hence with diligence!
658	
659	[Exit ARIEL]
660	
661	Awake, dear heart, awake! thou hast slept well; Awake!
662	
663	MIRANDA	     The strangeness of your story put
664	Heaviness in me.
665	
666	PROSPERO	                  Shake it off. Come on;
667	We'll visit Caliban my slave, who never
668	Yields us kind answer.
669	
670	MIRANDA	'Tis a villain, sir,
671	I do not love to look on.
672	
673	PROSPERO	But, as 'tis,
674	We cannot miss him: he does make our fire,
675	Fetch in our wood and serves in offices
676	That profit us. What, ho! slave! Caliban!
677	Thou earth, thou! speak.
678	
679	CALIBAN	[Within]  There's wood enough within.
680	
681	PROSPERO	Come forth, I say! there's other business for thee:
682	Come, thou tortoise! when?
683	
684	[Re-enter ARIEL like a water-nymph]
685	
686	Fine apparition! My quaint Ariel,
687	Hark in thine ear.
688	
689	ARIEL	                  My lord it shall be done.
690	
691	[Exit]
692	
693	PROSPERO	Thou poisonous slave, got by the devil himself
694	Upon thy wicked dam, come forth!
695	
696	[Enter CALIBAN]
697	
698	CALIBAN	As wicked dew as e'er my mother brush'd
699	With raven's feather from unwholesome fen
700	Drop on you both! a south-west blow on ye
701	And blister you all o'er!
702	
703	PROSPERO	For this, be sure, to-night thou shalt have cramps,
704	Side-stitches that shall pen thy breath up; urchins
705	Shall, for that vast of night that they may work,
706	All exercise on thee; thou shalt be pinch'd
707	As thick as honeycomb, each pinch more stinging
708	Than bees that made 'em.
709	
710	CALIBAN	I must eat my dinner.
711	This island's mine, by Sycorax my mother,
712	Which thou takest from me. When thou camest first,
713	Thou strokedst me and madest much of me, wouldst give me
714	Water with berries in't, and teach me how
715	To name the bigger light, and how the less,
716	That burn by day and night: and then I loved thee
717	And show'd thee all the qualities o' the isle,
718	The fresh springs, brine-pits, barren place and fertile:
719	Cursed be I that did so! All the charms
720	Of Sycorax, toads, beetles, bats, light on you!
721	For I am all the subjects that you have,
722	Which first was mine own king: and here you sty me
723	In this hard rock, whiles you do keep from me
724	The rest o' the island.
725	
726	PROSPERO	Thou most lying slave,
727	Whom stripes may move, not kindness! I have used thee,
728	Filth as thou art, with human care, and lodged thee
729	In mine own cell, till thou didst seek to violate
730	The honour of my child.
731	
732	CALIBAN	O ho, O ho! would't had been done!
733	Thou didst prevent me; I had peopled else
734	This isle with Calibans.
735	
736	PROSPERO	Abhorred slave,
737	Which any print of goodness wilt not take,
738	Being capable of all ill! I pitied thee,
739	Took pains to make thee speak, taught thee each hour
740	One thing or other: when thou didst not, savage,
741	Know thine own meaning, but wouldst gabble like
742	A thing most brutish, I endow'd thy purposes
743	With words that made them known. But thy vile race,
744	Though thou didst learn, had that in't which
745	good natures
746	Could not abide to be with; therefore wast thou
747	Deservedly confined into this rock,
748	Who hadst deserved more than a prison.
749	
750	CALIBAN	You taught me language; and my profit on't
751	Is, I know how to curse. The red plague rid you
752	For learning me your language!
753	
754	PROSPERO	Hag-seed, hence!
755	Fetch us in fuel; and be quick, thou'rt best,
756	To answer other business. Shrug'st thou, malice?
757	If thou neglect'st or dost unwillingly
758	What I command, I'll rack thee with old cramps,
759	Fill all thy bones with aches, make thee roar
760	That beasts shall tremble at thy din.
761	
762	CALIBAN	No, pray thee.
763	
764	[Aside]
765	
766	I must obey: his art is of such power,
767	It would control my dam's god, Setebos,
768	and make a vassal of him.
769	
770	PROSPERO	So, slave; hence!
771	
772	[Exit CALIBAN]
773	
774	[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible, playing and singing;
775	FERDINAND following]
776	
777	ARIEL'S song.
778	
779	Come unto these yellow sands,
780	And then take hands:
781	Courtsied when you have and kiss'd
782	The wild waves whist,
783	Foot it featly here and there;
784	And, sweet sprites, the burthen bear.
785	Hark, hark!
786	
787	[Burthen [dispersedly, within]  Bow-wow]
788	
789	The watch-dogs bark!
790	
791	[Burthen Bow-wow]
792	
793	Hark, hark! I hear
794	The strain of strutting chanticleer
795	Cry, Cock-a-diddle-dow.
796	
797	FERDINAND	Where should this music be? i' the air or the earth?
798	It sounds no more: and sure, it waits upon
799	Some god o' the island. Sitting on a bank,
800	Weeping again the king my father's wreck,
801	This music crept by me upon the waters,
802	Allaying both their fury and my passion
803	With its sweet air: thence I have follow'd it,
804	Or it hath drawn me rather. But 'tis gone.
805	No, it begins again.
806	
807	[ARIEL sings]
808	
809	Full fathom five thy father lies;
810	Of his bones are coral made;
811	Those are pearls that were his eyes:
812	Nothing of him that doth fade
813	But doth suffer a sea-change
814	Into something rich and strange.
815	Sea-nymphs hourly ring his knell
816	
817	[Burthen Ding-dong]
818	
819	Hark! now I hear them,--Ding-dong, bell.
820	
821	FERDINAND	The ditty does remember my drown'd father.
822	This is no mortal business, nor no sound
823	That the earth owes. I hear it now above me.
824	
825	PROSPERO	The fringed curtains of thine eye advance
826	And say what thou seest yond.
827	
828	MIRANDA	What is't? a spirit?
829	Lord, how it looks about! Believe me, sir,
830	It carries a brave form. But 'tis a spirit.
831	
832	PROSPERO	No, wench; it eats and sleeps and hath such senses
833	As we have, such. This gallant which thou seest
834	Was in the wreck; and, but he's something stain'd
835	With grief that's beauty's canker, thou mightst call him
836	A goodly person: he hath lost his fellows
837	And strays about to find 'em.
838	
839	MIRANDA	I might call him
840	A thing divine, for nothing natural
841	I ever saw so noble.
842	
843	PROSPERO	[Aside] It goes on, I see,
844	As my soul prompts it. Spirit, fine spirit! I'll free thee
845	Within two days for this.
846	
847	FERDINAND	Most sure, the goddess
848	On whom these airs attend! Vouchsafe my prayer
849	May know if you remain upon this island;
850	And that you will some good instruction give
851	How I may bear me here: my prime request,
852	Which I do last pronounce, is, O you wonder!
853	If you be maid or no?
854	
855	MIRANDA	No wonder, sir;
856	But certainly a maid.
857	
858	FERDINAND	My language! heavens!
859	I am the best of them that speak this speech,
860	Were I but where 'tis spoken.
861	
862	PROSPERO	How? the best?
863	What wert thou, if the King of Naples heard thee?
864	
865	FERDINAND	A single thing, as I am now, that wonders
866	To hear thee speak of Naples. He does hear me;
867	And that he does I weep: myself am Naples,
868	Who with mine eyes, never since at ebb, beheld
869	The king my father wreck'd.
870	
871	MIRANDA	Alack, for mercy!
872	
873	FERDINAND	Yes, faith, and all his lords; the Duke of Milan
874	And his brave son being twain.
875	
876	PROSPERO	[Aside]	The Duke of Milan
877	And his more braver daughter could control thee,
878	If now 'twere fit to do't. At the first sight
879	They have changed eyes. Delicate Ariel,
880	I'll set thee free for this.
881	
882	[To FERDINAND]
883	
884	A word, good sir;
885	I fear you have done yourself some wrong: a word.
886	
887	MIRANDA	Why speaks my father so ungently? This
888	Is the third man that e'er I saw, the first
889	That e'er I sigh'd for: pity move my father
890	To be inclined my way!
891	
892	FERDINAND	O, if a virgin,
893	And your affection not gone forth, I'll make you
894	The queen of Naples.
895	
896	PROSPERO	Soft, sir! one word more.
897	
898	[Aside]
899	
900	They are both in either's powers; but this swift business
901	I must uneasy make, lest too light winning
902	Make the prize light.
903	
904	[To FERDINAND]
905	
906	One word more; I charge thee
907	That thou attend me: thou dost here usurp
908	The name thou owest not; and hast put thyself
909	Upon this island as a spy, to win it
910	From me, the lord on't.
911	
912	FERDINAND	No, as I am a man.
913	
914	MIRANDA	There's nothing ill can dwell in such a temple:
915	If the ill spirit have so fair a house,
916	Good things will strive to dwell with't.
917	
918	PROSPERO	Follow me.
919	Speak not you for him; he's a traitor. Come;
920	I'll manacle thy neck and feet together:
921	Sea-water shalt thou drink; thy food shall be
922	The fresh-brook muscles, wither'd roots and husks
923	Wherein the acorn cradled. Follow.
924	
925	FERDINAND	No;
926	I will resist such entertainment till
927	Mine enemy has more power.
928	
929	[Draws, and is charmed from moving]
930	
931	MIRANDA	O dear father,
932	Make not too rash a trial of him, for
933	He's gentle and not fearful.
934	
935	PROSPERO	What? I say,
936	My foot my tutor? Put thy sword up, traitor;
937	Who makest a show but darest not strike, thy conscience
938	Is so possess'd with guilt: come from thy ward,
939	For I can here disarm thee with this stick
940	And make thy weapon drop.
941	
942	MIRANDA	Beseech you, father.
943	
944	PROSPERO	Hence! hang not on my garments.
945	
946	MIRANDA	Sir, have pity;
947	I'll be his surety.
948	
949	PROSPERO	Silence! one word more
950	Shall make me chide thee, if not hate thee. What!
951	An advocate for an imposter! hush!
952	Thou think'st there is no more such shapes as he,
953	Having seen but him and Caliban: foolish wench!
954	To the most of men this is a Caliban
955	And they to him are angels.
956	
957	MIRANDA	My affections
958	Are then most humble; I have no ambition
959	To see a goodlier man.
960	
961	PROSPERO	Come on; obey:
962	Thy nerves are in their infancy again
963	And have no vigour in them.
964	
965	FERDINAND	So they are;
966	My spirits, as in a dream, are all bound up.
967	My father's loss, the weakness which I feel,
968	The wreck of all my friends, nor this man's threats,
969	To whom I am subdued, are but light to me,
970	Might I but through my prison once a day
971	Behold this maid: all corners else o' the earth
972	Let liberty make use of; space enough
973	Have I in such a prison.
974	
975	PROSPERO	[Aside]                It works.
976	
977	[To FERDINAND]
978	
979	Come on.
980	Thou hast done well, fine Ariel!
981	
982	[To FERDINAND]
983	
984	Follow me.
985	
986	[To ARIEL]
987	
988	Hark what thou else shalt do me.
989	
990	MIRANDA	Be of comfort;
991	My father's of a better nature, sir,
992	Than he appears by speech: this is unwonted
993	Which now came from him.
994	
995	PROSPERO	Thou shalt be free
996	As mountain winds: but then exactly do
997	All points of my command.
998	
999	ARIEL	To the syllable.
1000	
1001	PROSPERO	Come, follow. Speak not for him.
1002	
1003	[Exeunt]

1008	THE TEMPEST
1009	
1010	
1011	ACT II
1012	
1013	
1014	
1015	SCENE I	Another part of the island.
1016	
1017	
1018	[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,
1019	ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]
1020	
1021	GONZALO	Beseech you, sir, be merry; you have cause,
1022	So have we all, of joy; for our escape
1023	Is much beyond our loss. Our hint of woe
1024	Is common; every day some sailor's wife,
1025	The masters of some merchant and the merchant
1026	Have just our theme of woe; but for the miracle,
1027	I mean our preservation, few in millions
1028	Can speak like us: then wisely, good sir, weigh
1029	Our sorrow with our comfort.
1030	
1031	ALONSO	Prithee, peace.
1032	
1033	SEBASTIAN	He receives comfort like cold porridge.
1034	
1035	ANTONIO	The visitor will not give him o'er so.
1036	
1037	SEBASTIAN	Look he's winding up the watch of his wit;
1038	by and by it will strike.
1039	
1040	GONZALO	Sir,--
1041	
1042	SEBASTIAN	One: tell.
1043	
1044	GONZALO	When every grief is entertain'd that's offer'd,
1045	Comes to the entertainer--
1046	
1047	SEBASTIAN	A dollar.
1048	
1049	GONZALO	Dolour comes to him, indeed: you
1050	have spoken truer than you purposed.
1051	
1052	SEBASTIAN	You have taken it wiselier than I meant you should.
1053	
1054	GONZALO	Therefore, my lord,--
1055	
1056	ANTONIO	Fie, what a spendthrift is he of his tongue!
1057	
1058	ALONSO	I prithee, spare.
1059	
1060	GONZALO	Well, I have done: but yet,--
1061	
1062	SEBASTIAN	He will be talking.
1063	
1064	ANTONIO	Which, of he or Adrian, for a good
1065	wager, first begins to crow?
1066	
1067	SEBASTIAN	The old cock.
1068	
1069	ANTONIO	The cockerel.
1070	
1071	SEBASTIAN	Done. The wager?
1072	
1073	ANTONIO	A laughter.
1074	
1075	SEBASTIAN	A match!
1076	
1077	ADRIAN	Though this island seem to be desert,--
1078	
1079	SEBASTIAN	Ha, ha, ha! So, you're paid.
1080	
1081	ADRIAN	Uninhabitable and almost inaccessible,--
1082	
1083	SEBASTIAN	Yet,--
1084	
1085	ADRIAN	Yet,--
1086	
1087	ANTONIO	He could not miss't.
1088	
1089	ADRIAN	It must needs be of subtle, tender and delicate
1090	temperance.
1091	
1092	ANTONIO	Temperance was a delicate wench.
1093	
1094	SEBASTIAN	Ay, and a subtle; as he most learnedly delivered.
1095	
1096	ADRIAN	The air breathes upon us here most sweetly.
1097	
1098	SEBASTIAN	As if it had lungs and rotten ones.
1099	
1100	ANTONIO	Or as 'twere perfumed by a fen.
1101	
1102	GONZALO	Here is everything advantageous to life.
1103	
1104	ANTONIO	True; save means to live.
1105	
1106	SEBASTIAN	Of that there's none, or little.
1107	
1108	GONZALO	How lush and lusty the grass looks! how green!
1109	
1110	ANTONIO	The ground indeed is tawny.
1111	
1112	SEBASTIAN	With an eye of green in't.
1113	
1114	ANTONIO	He misses not much.
1115	
1116	SEBASTIAN	No; he doth but mistake the truth totally.
1117	
1118	GONZALO	But the rarity of it is,--which is indeed almost
1119	beyond credit,--
1120	
1121	SEBASTIAN	As many vouched rarities are.
1122	
1123	GONZALO	That our garments, being, as they were, drenched in
1124	the sea, hold notwithstanding their freshness and
1125	glosses, being rather new-dyed than stained with
1126	salt water.
1127	
1128	ANTONIO	If but one of his pockets could speak, would it not
1129	say he lies?
1130	
1131	SEBASTIAN	Ay, or very falsely pocket up his report
1132	
1133	GONZALO	Methinks our garments are now as fresh as when we
1134	put them on first in Afric, at the marriage of
1135	the king's fair daughter Claribel to the King of Tunis.
1136	
1137	SEBASTIAN	'Twas a sweet marriage, and we prosper well in our return.
1138	
1139	ADRIAN	Tunis was never graced before with such a paragon to
1140	their queen.
1141	
1142	GONZALO	Not since widow Dido's time.
1143	
1144	ANTONIO	Widow! a pox o' that! How came that widow in?
1145	widow Dido!
1146	
1147	SEBASTIAN	What if he had said 'widower AEneas' too? Good Lord,
1148	how you take it!
1149	
1150	ADRIAN	'Widow Dido' said you? you make me study of that:
1151	she was of Carthage, not of Tunis.
1152	
1153	GONZALO	This Tunis, sir, was Carthage.
1154	
1155	ADRIAN	Carthage?
1156	
1157	GONZALO	I assure you, Carthage.
1158	
1159	SEBASTIAN	His word is more than the miraculous harp; he hath
1160	raised the wall and houses too.
1161	
1162	ANTONIO	What impossible matter will he make easy next?
1163	
1164	SEBASTIAN	I think he will carry this island home in his pocket
1165	and give it his son for an apple.
1166	
1167	ANTONIO	And, sowing the kernels of it in the sea, bring
1168	forth more islands.
1169	
1170	GONZALO	Ay.
1171	
1172	ANTONIO	Why, in good time.
1173	
1174	GONZALO	Sir, we were talking that our garments seem now
1175	as fresh as when we were at Tunis at the marriage
1176	of your daughter, who is now queen.
1177	
1178	ANTONIO	And the rarest that e'er came there.
1179	
1180	SEBASTIAN	Bate, I beseech you, widow Dido.
1181	
1182	ANTONIO	O, widow Dido! ay, widow Dido.
1183	
1184	GONZALO	Is not, sir, my doublet as fresh as the first day I
1185	wore it? I mean, in a sort.
1186	
1187	ANTONIO	That sort was well fished for.
1188	
1189	GONZALO	When I wore it at your daughter's marriage?
1190	
1191	ALONSO	You cram these words into mine ears against
1192	The stomach of my sense. Would I had never
1193	Married my daughter there! for, coming thence,
1194	My son is lost and, in my rate, she too,
1195	Who is so far from Italy removed
1196	I ne'er again shall see her. O thou mine heir
1197	Of Naples and of Milan, what strange fish
1198	Hath made his meal on thee?
1199	
1200	FRANCISCO	Sir, he may live:
1201	I saw him beat the surges under him,
1202	And ride upon their backs; he trod the water,
1203	Whose enmity he flung aside, and breasted
1204	The surge most swoln that met him; his bold head
1205	'Bove the contentious waves he kept, and oar'd
1206	Himself with his good arms in lusty stroke
1207	To the shore, that o'er his wave-worn basis bow'd,
1208	As stooping to relieve him: I not doubt
1209	He came alive to land.
1210	
1211	ALONSO	No, no, he's gone.
1212	
1213	SEBASTIAN	Sir, you may thank yourself for this great loss,
1214	That would not bless our Europe with your daughter,
1215	But rather lose her to an African;
1216	Where she at least is banish'd from your eye,
1217	Who hath cause to wet the grief on't.
1218	
1219	ALONSO	Prithee, peace.
1220	
1221	SEBASTIAN	You were kneel'd to and importuned otherwise
1222	By all of us, and the fair soul herself
1223	Weigh'd between loathness and obedience, at
1224	Which end o' the beam should bow. We have lost your
1225	son,
1226	I fear, for ever: Milan and Naples have
1227	More widows in them of this business' making
1228	Than we bring men to comfort them:
1229	The fault's your own.
1230	
1231	ALONSO	So is the dear'st o' the loss.
1232	
1233	GONZALO	My lord Sebastian,
1234	The truth you speak doth lack some gentleness
1235	And time to speak it in: you rub the sore,
1236	When you should bring the plaster.
1237	
1238	SEBASTIAN	Very well.
1239	
1240	ANTONIO	And most chirurgeonly.
1241	
1242	GONZALO	It is foul weather in us all, good sir,
1243	When you are cloudy.
1244	
1245	SEBASTIAN	Foul weather?
1246	
1247	ANTONIO	Very foul.
1248	
1249	GONZALO	Had I plantation of this isle, my lord,--
1250	
1251	ANTONIO	He'ld sow't with nettle-seed.
1252	
1253	SEBASTIAN	Or docks, or mallows.
1254	
1255	GONZALO	And were the king on't, what would I do?
1256	
1257	SEBASTIAN	'Scape being drunk for want of wine.
1258	
1259	GONZALO	I' the commonwealth I would by contraries
1260	Execute all things; for no kind of traffic
1261	Would I admit; no name of magistrate;
1262	Letters should not be known; riches, poverty,
1263	And use of service, none; contract, succession,
1264	Bourn, bound of land, tilth, vineyard, none;
1265	No use of metal, corn, or wine, or oil;
1266	No occupation; all men idle, all;
1267	And women too, but innocent and pure;
1268	No sovereignty;--
1269	
1270	SEBASTIAN	                  Yet he would be king on't.
1271	
1272	ANTONIO	The latter end of his commonwealth forgets the
1273	beginning.
1274	
1275	GONZALO	All things in common nature should produce
1276	Without sweat or endeavour: treason, felony,
1277	Sword, pike, knife, gun, or need of any engine,
1278	Would I not have; but nature should bring forth,
1279	Of its own kind, all foison, all abundance,
1280	To feed my innocent people.
1281	
1282	SEBASTIAN	No marrying 'mong his subjects?
1283	
1284	ANTONIO	None, man; all idle: whores and knaves.
1285	
1286	GONZALO	I would with such perfection govern, sir,
1287	To excel the golden age.
1288	
1289	SEBASTIAN	God save his majesty!
1290	
1291	ANTONIO	Long live Gonzalo!
1292	
1293	GONZALO	                  And,--do you mark me, sir?
1294	
1295	ALONSO	Prithee, no more: thou dost talk nothing to me.
1296	
1297	GONZALO	I do well believe your highness; and
1298	did it to minister occasion to these gentlemen,
1299	who are of such sensible and nimble lungs that
1300	they always use to laugh at nothing.
1301	
1302	ANTONIO	'Twas you we laughed at.
1303	
1304	GONZALO	Who in this kind of merry fooling am nothing
1305	to you: so you may continue and laugh at
1306	nothing still.
1307	
1308	ANTONIO	What a blow was there given!
1309	
1310	SEBASTIAN	An it had not fallen flat-long.
1311	
1312	GONZALO	You are gentlemen of brave metal; you would lift
1313	the moon out of her sphere, if she would continue
1314	in it five weeks without changing.
1315	
1316	[Enter ARIEL, invisible, playing solemn music]
1317	
1318	SEBASTIAN	We would so, and then go a bat-fowling.
1319	
1320	ANTONIO	Nay, good my lord, be not angry.
1321	
1322	GONZALO	No, I warrant you; I will not adventure
1323	my discretion so weakly. Will you laugh
1324	me asleep, for I am very heavy?
1325	
1326	ANTONIO	Go sleep, and hear us.
1327	
1328	[All sleep except ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]
1329	
1330	ALONSO	What, all so soon asleep! I wish mine eyes
1331	Would, with themselves, shut up my thoughts: I find
1332	They are inclined to do so.
1333	
1334	SEBASTIAN	Please you, sir,
1335	Do not omit the heavy offer of it:
1336	It seldom visits sorrow; when it doth,
1337	It is a comforter.
1338	
1339	ANTONIO	                  We two, my lord,
1340	Will guard your person while you take your rest,
1341	And watch your safety.
1342	
1343	ALONSO	Thank you. Wondrous heavy.
1344	
1345	[ALONSO sleeps. Exit ARIEL]
1346	
1347	SEBASTIAN	What a strange drowsiness possesses them!
1348	
1349	ANTONIO	It is the quality o' the climate.
1350	
1351	SEBASTIAN	Why
1352	Doth it not then our eyelids sink? I find not
1353	Myself disposed to sleep.
1354	
1355	ANTONIO	Nor I; my spirits are nimble.
1356	They fell together all, as by consent;
1357	They dropp'd, as by a thunder-stroke. What might,
1358	Worthy Sebastian? O, what might?--No more:--
1359	And yet me thinks I see it in thy face,
1360	What thou shouldst be: the occasion speaks thee, and
1361	My strong imagination sees a crown
1362	Dropping upon thy head.
1363	
1364	SEBASTIAN	What, art thou waking?
1365	
1366	ANTONIO	Do you not hear me speak?
1367	
1368	SEBASTIAN	I do; and surely
1369	It is a sleepy language and thou speak'st
1370	Out of thy sleep. What is it thou didst say?
1371	This is a strange repose, to be asleep
1372	With eyes wide open; standing, speaking, moving,
1373	And yet so fast asleep.
1374	
1375	ANTONIO	Noble Sebastian,
1376	Thou let'st thy fortune sleep--die, rather; wink'st
1377	Whiles thou art waking.
1378	
1379	SEBASTIAN	Thou dost snore distinctly;
1380	There's meaning in thy snores.
1381	
1382	ANTONIO	I am more serious than my custom: you
1383	Must be so too, if heed me; which to do
1384	Trebles thee o'er.
1385	
1386	SEBASTIAN	                  Well, I am standing water.
1387	
1388	ANTONIO	I'll teach you how to flow.
1389	
1390	SEBASTIAN	Do so: to ebb
1391	Hereditary sloth instructs me.
1392	
1393	ANTONIO	O,
1394	If you but knew how you the purpose cherish
1395	Whiles thus you mock it! how, in stripping it,
1396	You more invest it! Ebbing men, indeed,
1397	Most often do so near the bottom run
1398	By their own fear or sloth.
1399	
1400	SEBASTIAN	Prithee, say on:
1401	The setting of thine eye and cheek proclaim
1402	A matter from thee, and a birth indeed
1403	Which throes thee much to yield.
1404	
1405	ANTONIO	Thus, sir:
1406	Although this lord of weak remembrance, this,
1407	Who shall be of as little memory
1408	When he is earth'd, hath here almost persuade,--
1409	For he's a spirit of persuasion, only
1410	Professes to persuade,--the king his son's alive,
1411	'Tis as impossible that he's undrown'd
1412	And he that sleeps here swims.
1413	
1414	SEBASTIAN	I have no hope
1415	That he's undrown'd.
1416	
1417	ANTONIO	O, out of that 'no hope'
1418	What great hope have you! no hope that way is
1419	Another way so high a hope that even
1420	Ambition cannot pierce a wink beyond,
1421	But doubt discovery there. Will you grant with me
1422	That Ferdinand is drown'd?
1423	
1424	SEBASTIAN	He's gone.
1425	
1426	ANTONIO	Then, tell me,
1427	Who's the next heir of Naples?
1428	
1429	SEBASTIAN	Claribel.
1430	
1431	ANTONIO	She that is queen of Tunis; she that dwells
1432	Ten leagues beyond man's life; she that from Naples
1433	Can have no note, unless the sun were post--
1434	The man i' the moon's too slow--till new-born chins
1435	Be rough and razorable; she that--from whom?
1436	We all were sea-swallow'd, though some cast again,
1437	And by that destiny to perform an act
1438	Whereof what's past is prologue, what to come
1439	In yours and my discharge.
1440	
1441	SEBASTIAN	What stuff is this! how say you?
1442	'Tis true, my brother's daughter's queen of Tunis;
1443	So is she heir of Naples; 'twixt which regions
1444	There is some space.
1445	
1446	ANTONIO	A space whose every cubit
1447	Seems to cry out, 'How shall that Claribel
1448	Measure us back to Naples? Keep in Tunis,
1449	And let Sebastian wake.' Say, this were death
1450	That now hath seized them; why, they were no worse
1451	Than now they are. There be that can rule Naples
1452	As well as he that sleeps; lords that can prate
1453	As amply and unnecessarily
1454	As this Gonzalo; I myself could make
1455	A chough of as deep chat. O, that you bore
1456	The mind that I do! what a sleep were this
1457	For your advancement! Do you understand me?
1458	
1459	SEBASTIAN	Methinks I do.
1460	
1461	ANTONIO	                  And how does your content
1462	Tender your own good fortune?
1463	
1464	SEBASTIAN	I remember
1465	You did supplant your brother Prospero.
1466	
1467	ANTONIO	True:
1468	And look how well my garments sit upon me;
1469	Much feater than before: my brother's servants
1470	Were then my fellows; now they are my men.
1471	
1472	SEBASTIAN	But, for your conscience?
1473	
1474	ANTONIO	Ay, sir; where lies that? if 'twere a kibe,
1475	'Twould put me to my slipper: but I feel not
1476	This deity in my bosom: twenty consciences,
1477	That stand 'twixt me and Milan, candied be they
1478	And melt ere they molest! Here lies your brother,
1479	No better than the earth he lies upon,
1480	If he were that which now he's like, that's dead;
1481	Whom I, with this obedient steel, three inches of it,
1482	Can lay to bed for ever; whiles you, doing thus,
1483	To the perpetual wink for aye might put
1484	This ancient morsel, this Sir Prudence, who
1485	Should not upbraid our course. For all the rest,
1486	They'll take suggestion as a cat laps milk;
1487	They'll tell the clock to any business that
1488	We say befits the hour.
1489	
1490	SEBASTIAN	Thy case, dear friend,
1491	Shall be my precedent; as thou got'st Milan,
1492	I'll come by Naples. Draw thy sword: one stroke
1493	Shall free thee from the tribute which thou payest;
1494	And I the king shall love thee.
1495	
1496	ANTONIO	Draw together;
1497	And when I rear my hand, do you the like,
1498	To fall it on Gonzalo.
1499	
1500	SEBASTIAN	O, but one word.
1501	
1502	[They talk apart]
1503	
1504	[Re-enter ARIEL, invisible]
1505	
1506	ARIEL	My master through his art foresees the danger
1507	That you, his friend, are in; and sends me forth--
1508	For else his project dies--to keep them living.
1509	
1510	[Sings in GONZALO's ear]
1511	
1512	While you here do snoring lie,
1513	Open-eyed conspiracy
1514	His time doth take.
1515	If of life you keep a care,
1516	Shake off slumber, and beware:
1517	Awake, awake!
1518	
1519	ANTONIO	Then let us both be sudden.
1520	
1521	GONZALO	Now, good angels
1522	Preserve the king.
1523	
1524	[They wake]
1525	
1526	ALONSO	Why, how now? ho, awake! Why are you drawn?
1527	Wherefore this ghastly looking?
1528	
1529	GONZALO	What's the matter?
1530	
1531	SEBASTIAN	Whiles we stood here securing your repose,
1532	Even now, we heard a hollow burst of bellowing
1533	Like bulls, or rather lions: did't not wake you?
1534	It struck mine ear most terribly.
1535	
1536	ALONSO	I heard nothing.
1537	
1538	ANTONIO	O, 'twas a din to fright a monster's ear,
1539	To make an earthquake! sure, it was the roar
1540	Of a whole herd of lions.
1541	
1542	ALONSO	Heard you this, Gonzalo?
1543	
1544	GONZALO	Upon mine honour, sir, I heard a humming,
1545	And that a strange one too, which did awake me:
1546	I shaked you, sir, and cried: as mine eyes open'd,
1547	I saw their weapons drawn: there was a noise,
1548	That's verily. 'Tis best we stand upon our guard,
1549	Or that we quit this place; let's draw our weapons.
1550	
1551	ALONSO	Lead off this ground; and let's make further search
1552	For my poor son.
1553	
1554	GONZALO	Heavens keep him from these beasts!
1555	For he is, sure, i' the island.
1556	
1557	ALONSO	Lead away.
1558	
1559	ARIEL	Prospero my lord shall know what I have done:
1560	So, king, go safely on to seek thy son.
1561	
1562	[Exeunt]
1563	
1564

1567	THE TEMPEST
1568	
1569	
1570	ACT II
1571	
1572	
1573	
1574	SCENE II	Another part of the island.
1575	
1576	
1577	[Enter CALIBAN with a burden of wood. A noise of
1578	thunder heard]
1579	
1580	CALIBAN	All the infections that the sun sucks up
1581	From bogs, fens, flats, on Prosper fall and make him
1582	By inch-meal a disease! His spirits hear me
1583	And yet I needs must curse. But they'll nor pinch,
1584	Fright me with urchin--shows, pitch me i' the mire,
1585	Nor lead me, like a firebrand, in the dark
1586	Out of my way, unless he bid 'em; but
1587	For every trifle are they set upon me;
1588	Sometime like apes that mow and chatter at me
1589	And after bite me, then like hedgehogs which
1590	Lie tumbling in my barefoot way and mount
1591	Their pricks at my footfall; sometime am I
1592	All wound with adders who with cloven tongues
1593	Do hiss me into madness.
1594	
1595	[Enter TRINCULO]
1596	
1597	Lo, now, lo!
1598	
1599	Here comes a spirit of his, and to torment me
1600	For bringing wood in slowly. I'll fall flat;
1601	Perchance he will not mind me.
1602	
1603	TRINCULO	Here's neither bush nor shrub, to bear off
1604	any weather at all, and another storm brewing;
1605	I hear it sing i' the wind: yond same black
1606	cloud, yond huge one, looks like a foul
1607	bombard that would shed his liquor. If it
1608	should thunder as it did before, I know not
1609	where to hide my head: yond same cloud cannot
1610	choose but fall by pailfuls. What have we
1611	here? a man or a fish? dead or alive? A fish:
1612	he smells like a fish; a very ancient and fish-
1613	like smell; a kind of not of the newest Poor-
1614	John. A strange fish! Were I in England now,
1615	as once I was, and had but this fish painted,
1616	not a holiday fool there but would give a piece
1617	of silver: there would this monster make a
1618	man; any strange beast there makes a man:
1619	when they will not give a doit to relieve a lame
1620	beggar, they will lazy out ten to see a dead
1621	Indian. Legged like a man and his fins like
1622	arms! Warm o' my troth! I do now let loose
1623	my opinion; hold it no longer: this is no fish,
1624	but an islander, that hath lately suffered by a
1625	thunderbolt.
1626	
1627	[Thunder]
1628	
1629	Alas, the storm is come again! my best way is to
1630	creep under his gaberdine; there is no other
1631	shelter hereabouts: misery acquaints a man with
1632	strange bed-fellows. I will here shroud till the
1633	dregs of the storm be past.
1634	
1635	[Enter STEPHANO, singing: a bottle in his hand]
1636	
1637	STEPHANO	   I shall no more to sea, to sea,
1638	Here shall I die ashore--
1639	
1640	This is a very scurvy tune to sing at a man's
1641	funeral: well, here's my comfort. [Drinks]
1642	
1643	[Sings]
1644	
1645	The master, the swabber, the boatswain and I,
1646	The gunner and his mate
1647	Loved Mall, Meg and Marian and Margery,
1648	But none of us cared for Kate;
1649	For she had a tongue with a tang,
1650	Would cry to a sailor, Go hang!
1651	She loved not the savour of tar nor of pitch,
1652	Yet a tailor might scratch her where'er she did itch:
1653	Then to sea, boys, and let her go hang!
1654	
1655	This is a scurvy tune too: but here's my comfort.
1656	[Drinks]
1657	
1658	CALIBAN	Do not torment me: Oh!
1659	
1660	STEPHANO	What's the matter? Have we devils here? Do you put
1661	tricks upon's with savages and men of Ind, ha? I
1662	have not scaped drowning to be afeard now of your
1663	four legs; for it hath been said, As proper a man as
1664	ever went on four legs cannot make him give ground;
1665	and it shall be said so again while Stephano
1666	breathes at's nostrils.
1667	
1668	CALIBAN	The spirit torments me; Oh!
1669	
1670	STEPHANO	This is some monster of the isle with four legs, who
1671	hath got, as I take it, an ague. Where the devil
1672	should he learn our language? I will give him some
1673	relief, if it be but for that. if I can recover him
1674	and keep him tame and get to Naples with him, he's a
1675	present for any emperor that ever trod on neat's leather.
1676	
1677	CALIBAN	Do not torment me, prithee; I'll bring my wood home faster.
1678	
1679	STEPHANO	He's in his fit now and does not talk after the
1680	wisest. He shall taste of my bottle: if he have
1681	never drunk wine afore will go near to remove his
1682	fit. If I can recover him and keep him tame, I will
1683	not take too much for him; he shall pay for him that
1684	hath him, and that soundly.
1685	
1686	CALIBAN	Thou dost me yet but little hurt; thou wilt anon, I
1687	know it by thy trembling: now Prosper works upon thee.
1688	
1689	STEPHANO	Come on your ways; open your mouth; here is that
1690	which will give language to you, cat: open your
1691	mouth; this will shake your shaking, I can tell you,
1692	and that soundly: you cannot tell who's your friend:
1693	open your chaps again.
1694	
1695	TRINCULO	I should know that voice: it should be--but he is
1696	drowned; and these are devils: O defend me!
1697	
1698	STEPHANO	Four legs and two voices: a most delicate monster!
1699	His forward voice now is to speak well of his
1700	friend; his backward voice is to utter foul speeches
1701	and to detract. If all the wine in my bottle will
1702	recover him, I will help his ague. Come. Amen! I
1703	will pour some in thy other mouth.
1704	
1705	TRINCULO	Stephano!
1706	
1707	STEPHANO	Doth thy other mouth call me? Mercy, mercy! This is
1708	a devil, and no monster: I will leave him; I have no
1709	long spoon.
1710	
1711	TRINCULO	Stephano! If thou beest Stephano, touch me and
1712	speak to me: for I am Trinculo--be not afeard--thy
1713	good friend Trinculo.
1714	
1715	STEPHANO	If thou beest Trinculo, come forth: I'll pull thee
1716	by the lesser legs: if any be Trinculo's legs,
1717	these are they. Thou art very Trinculo indeed! How
1718	camest thou to be the siege of this moon-calf? can
1719	he vent Trinculos?
1720	
1721	TRINCULO	I took him to be killed with a thunder-stroke. But
1722	art thou not drowned, Stephano? I hope now thou art
1723	not drowned. Is the storm overblown? I hid me
1724	under the dead moon-calf's gaberdine for fear of
1725	the storm. And art thou living, Stephano? O
1726	Stephano, two Neapolitans 'scaped!
1727	
1728	STEPHANO	Prithee, do not turn me about; my stomach is not constant.
1729	
1730	CALIBAN	[Aside]  These be fine things, an if they be
1731	not sprites.
1732	That's a brave god and bears celestial liquor.
1733	I will kneel to him.
1734	
1735	STEPHANO	How didst thou 'scape? How camest thou hither?
1736	swear by this bottle how thou camest hither. I
1737	escaped upon a butt of sack which the sailors
1738	heaved o'erboard, by this bottle; which I made of
1739	the bark of a tree with mine own hands since I was
1740	cast ashore.
1741	
1742	CALIBAN	I'll swear upon that bottle to be thy true subject;
1743	for the liquor is not earthly.
1744	
1745	STEPHANO	Here; swear then how thou escapedst.
1746	
1747	TRINCULO	Swum ashore. man, like a duck: I can swim like a
1748	duck, I'll be sworn.
1749	
1750	STEPHANO	Here, kiss the book. Though thou canst swim like a
1751	duck, thou art made like a goose.
1752	
1753	TRINCULO	O Stephano. hast any more of this?
1754	
1755	STEPHANO	The whole butt, man: my cellar is in a rock by the
1756	sea-side where my wine is hid. How now, moon-calf!
1757	how does thine ague?
1758	
1759	CALIBAN	Hast thou not dropp'd from heaven?
1760	
1761	STEPHANO	Out o' the moon, I do assure thee: I was the man i'
1762	the moon when time was.
1763	
1764	CALIBAN	I have seen thee in her and I do adore thee:
1765	My mistress show'd me thee and thy dog and thy bush.
1766	
1767	STEPHANO	Come, swear to that; kiss the book: I will furnish
1768	it anon with new contents swear.
1769	
1770	TRINCULO	By this good light, this is a very shallow monster!
1771	I afeard of him! A very weak monster! The man i'
1772	the moon! A most poor credulous monster! Well
1773	drawn, monster, in good sooth!
1774	
1775	CALIBAN	I'll show thee every fertile inch o' th' island;
1776	And I will kiss thy foot: I prithee, be my god.
1777	
1778	TRINCULO	By this light, a most perfidious and drunken
1779	monster! when 's god's asleep, he'll rob his bottle.
1780	
1781	CALIBAN	I'll kiss thy foot; I'll swear myself thy subject.
1782	
1783	STEPHANO	Come on then; down, and swear.
1784	
1785	TRINCULO	I shall laugh myself to death at this puppy-headed
1786	monster. A most scurvy monster! I could find in my
1787	heart to beat him,--
1788	
1789	STEPHANO	Come, kiss.
1790	
1791	TRINCULO	But that the poor monster's in drink: an abominable monster!
1792	
1793	CALIBAN	I'll show thee the best springs; I'll pluck thee berries;
1794	I'll fish for thee and get thee wood enough.
1795	A plague upon the tyrant that I serve!
1796	I'll bear him no more sticks, but follow thee,
1797	Thou wondrous man.
1798	
1799	TRINCULO	A most ridiculous monster, to make a wonder of a
1800	Poor drunkard!
1801	
1802	CALIBAN	I prithee, let me bring thee where crabs grow;
1803	And I with my long nails will dig thee pignuts;
1804	Show thee a jay's nest and instruct thee how
1805	To snare the nimble marmoset; I'll bring thee
1806	To clustering filberts and sometimes I'll get thee
1807	Young scamels from the rock. Wilt thou go with me?
1808	
1809	STEPHANO	I prithee now, lead the way without any more
1810	talking. Trinculo, the king and all our company
1811	else being drowned, we will inherit here: here;
1812	bear my bottle: fellow Trinculo, we'll fill him by
1813	and by again.
1814	
1815	CALIBAN	[Sings drunkenly]
1816	Farewell master; farewell, farewell!
1817	
1818	TRINCULO	A howling monster: a drunken monster!
1819	
1820	CALIBAN	   No more dams I'll make for fish
1821	Nor fetch in firing
1822	At requiring;
1823	Nor scrape trencher, nor wash dish
1824	'Ban, 'Ban, Cacaliban
1825	Has a new master: get a new man.
1826	
1827	Freedom, hey-day! hey-day, freedom! freedom,
1828	hey-day, freedom!
1829	
1830	STEPHANO	O brave monster! Lead the way.

1839	
1840	ACT III
1841	
1842	
1843	
1844	SCENE I	Before PROSPERO'S Cell.
1845	
1846	
1847	[Enter FERDINAND, bearing a log]
1848	
1849	FERDINAND	There be some sports are painful, and their labour
1850	Delight in them sets off: some kinds of baseness
1851	Are nobly undergone and most poor matters
1852	Point to rich ends. This my mean task
1853	Would be as heavy to me as odious, but
1854	The mistress which I serve quickens what's dead
1855	And makes my labours pleasures: O, she is
1856	Ten times more gentle than her father's crabbed,
1857	And he's composed of harshness. I must remove
1858	Some thousands of these logs and pile them up,
1859	Upon a sore injunction: my sweet mistress
1860	Weeps when she sees me work, and says, such baseness
1861	Had never like executor. I forget:
1862	But these sweet thoughts do even refresh my labours,
1863	Most busy lest, when I do it.
1864	
1865	[Enter MIRANDA; and PROSPERO at a distance, unseen]
1866	
1867	MIRANDA	Alas, now, pray you,
1868	Work not so hard: I would the lightning had
1869	Burnt up those logs that you are enjoin'd to pile!
1870	Pray, set it down and rest you: when this burns,
1871	'Twill weep for having wearied you. My father
1872	Is hard at study; pray now, rest yourself;
1873	He's safe for these three hours.
1874	
1875	FERDINAND	O most dear mistress,
1876	The sun will set before I shall discharge
1877	What I must strive to do.
1878	
1879	MIRANDA	If you'll sit down,
1880	I'll bear your logs the while: pray, give me that;
1881	I'll carry it to the pile.
1882	
1883	FERDINAND	No, precious creature;
1884	I had rather crack my sinews, break my back,
1885	Than you should such dishonour undergo,
1886	While I sit lazy by.
1887	
1888	MIRANDA	It would become me
1889	As well as it does you: and I should do it
1890	With much more ease; for my good will is to it,
1891	And yours it is against.
1892	
1893	PROSPERO	Poor worm, thou art infected!
1894	This visitation shows it.
1895	
1896	MIRANDA	You look wearily.
1897	
1898	FERDINAND	No, noble mistress;'tis fresh morning with me
1899	When you are by at night. I do beseech you--
1900	Chiefly that I might set it in my prayers--
1901	What is your name?
1902	
1903	MIRANDA	                  Miranda.--O my father,
1904	I have broke your hest to say so!
1905	
1906	FERDINAND	Admired Miranda!
1907	Indeed the top of admiration! worth
1908	What's dearest to the world! Full many a lady
1909	I have eyed with best regard and many a time
1910	The harmony of their tongues hath into bondage
1911	Brought my too diligent ear: for several virtues
1912	Have I liked several women; never any
1913	With so fun soul, but some defect in her
1914	Did quarrel with the noblest grace she owed
1915	And put it to the foil: but you, O you,
1916	So perfect and so peerless, are created
1917	Of every creature's best!
1918	
1919	MIRANDA	I do not know
1920	One of my sex; no woman's face remember,
1921	Save, from my glass, mine own; nor have I seen
1922	More that I may call men than you, good friend,
1923	And my dear father: how features are abroad,
1924	I am skilless of; but, by my modesty,
1925	The jewel in my dower, I would not wish
1926	Any companion in the world but you,
1927	Nor can imagination form a shape,
1928	Besides yourself, to like of. But I prattle
1929	Something too wildly and my father's precepts
1930	I therein do forget.
1931	
1932	FERDINAND	I am in my condition
1933	A prince, Miranda; I do think, a king;
1934	I would, not so!--and would no more endure
1935	This wooden slavery than to suffer
1936	The flesh-fly blow my mouth. Hear my soul speak:
1937	The very instant that I saw you, did
1938	My heart fly to your service; there resides,
1939	To make me slave to it; and for your sake
1940	Am I this patient log--man.
1941	
1942	MIRANDA	Do you love me?
1943	
1944	FERDINAND	O heaven, O earth, bear witness to this sound
1945	And crown what I profess with kind event
1946	If I speak true! if hollowly, invert
1947	What best is boded me to mischief! I
1948	Beyond all limit of what else i' the world
1949	Do love, prize, honour you.
1950	
1951	MIRANDA	I am a fool
1952	To weep at what I am glad of.
1953	
1954	PROSPERO	Fair encounter
1955	Of two most rare affections! Heavens rain grace
1956	On that which breeds between 'em!
1957	
1958	FERDINAND	Wherefore weep you?
1959	
1960	MIRANDA	At mine unworthiness that dare not offer
1961	What I desire to give, and much less take
1962	What I shall die to want. But this is trifling;
1963	And all the more it seeks to hide itself,
1964	The bigger bulk it shows. Hence, bashful cunning!
1965	And prompt me, plain and holy innocence!
1966	I am your wife, it you will marry me;
1967	If not, I'll die your maid: to be your fellow
1968	You may deny me; but I'll be your servant,
1969	Whether you will or no.
1970	
1971	FERDINAND	My mistress, dearest;
1972	And I thus humble ever.
1973	
1974	MIRANDA	My husband, then?
1975	
1976	FERDINAND	Ay, with a heart as willing
1977	As bondage e'er of freedom: here's my hand.
1978	
1979	MIRANDA	And mine, with my heart in't; and now farewell
1980	Till half an hour hence.
1981	
1982	FERDINAND	A thousand thousand!
1983	
1984	[Exeunt FERDINAND and MIRANDA severally]
1985	
1986	PROSPERO	So glad of this as they I cannot be,
1987	Who are surprised withal; but my rejoicing
1988	At nothing can be more. I'll to my book,
1989	For yet ere supper-time must I perform
1990	Much business appertaining.

2000	ACT III
2001	
2002	
2003	
2004	SCENE II	Another part of the island.
2005	
2006	
2007	[Enter CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]
2008	
2009	STEPHANO	Tell not me; when the butt is out, we will drink
2010	water; not a drop before: therefore bear up, and
2011	board 'em. Servant-monster, drink to me.
2012	
2013	TRINCULO	Servant-monster! the folly of this island! They
2014	say there's but five upon this isle: we are three
2015	of them; if th' other two be brained like us, the
2016	state totters.
2017	
2018	STEPHANO	Drink, servant-monster, when I bid thee: thy eyes
2019	are almost set in thy head.
2020	
2021	TRINCULO	Where should they be set else? he were a brave
2022	monster indeed, if they were set in his tail.
2023	
2024	STEPHANO	My man-monster hath drown'd his tongue in sack:
2025	for my part, the sea cannot drown me; I swam, ere I
2026	could recover the shore, five and thirty leagues off
2027	and on. By this light, thou shalt be my lieutenant,
2028	monster, or my standard.
2029	
2030	TRINCULO	Your lieutenant, if you list; he's no standard.
2031	
2032	STEPHANO	We'll not run, Monsieur Monster.
2033	
2034	TRINCULO	Nor go neither; but you'll lie like dogs and yet say
2035	nothing neither.
2036	
2037	STEPHANO	Moon-calf, speak once in thy life, if thou beest a
2038	good moon-calf.
2039	
2040	CALIBAN	How does thy honour? Let me lick thy shoe.
2041	I'll not serve him; he's not valiant.
2042	
2043	TRINCULO	Thou liest, most ignorant monster: I am in case to
2044	justle a constable. Why, thou deboshed fish thou,
2045	was there ever man a coward that hath drunk so much
2046	sack as I to-day? Wilt thou tell a monstrous lie,
2047	being but half a fish and half a monster?
2048	
2049	CALIBAN	Lo, how he mocks me! wilt thou let him, my lord?
2050	
2051	TRINCULO	'Lord' quoth he! That a monster should be such a natural!
2052	
2053	CALIBAN	Lo, lo, again! bite him to death, I prithee.
2054	
2055	STEPHANO	Trinculo, keep a good tongue in your head: if you
2056	prove a mutineer,--the next tree! The poor monster's
2057	my subject and he shall not suffer indignity.
2058	
2059	CALIBAN	I thank my noble lord. Wilt thou be pleased to
2060	hearken once again to the suit I made to thee?
2061	
2062	STEPHANO	Marry, will I	kneel and repeat it; I will stand,
2063	and so shall Trinculo.
2064	
2065	[Enter ARIEL, invisible]
2066	
2067	CALIBAN	As I told thee before, I am subject to a tyrant, a
2068	sorcerer, that by his cunning hath cheated me of the island.
2069	
2070	ARIEL	Thou liest.
2071	
2072	CALIBAN	Thou liest, thou jesting monkey, thou: I would my
2073	valiant master would destroy thee! I do not lie.
2074	
2075	STEPHANO	Trinculo, if you trouble him any more in's tale, by
2076	this hand, I will supplant some of your teeth.
2077	
2078	TRINCULO	Why, I said nothing.
2079	
2080	STEPHANO	Mum, then, and no more. Proceed.
2081	
2082	CALIBAN	I say, by sorcery he got this isle;
2083	From me he got it. if thy greatness will
2084	Revenge it on him,--for I know thou darest,
2085	But this thing dare not,--
2086	
2087	STEPHANO	That's most certain.
2088	
2089	CALIBAN	Thou shalt be lord of it and I'll serve thee.
2090	
2091	STEPHANO	How now shall this be compassed?
2092	Canst thou bring me to the party?
2093	
2094	CALIBAN	Yea, yea, my lord: I'll yield him thee asleep,
2095	Where thou mayst knock a nail into his bead.
2096	
2097	ARIEL	Thou liest; thou canst not.
2098	
2099	CALIBAN	What a pied ninny's this! Thou scurvy patch!
2100	I do beseech thy greatness, give him blows
2101	And take his bottle from him: when that's gone
2102	He shall drink nought but brine; for I'll not show him
2103	Where the quick freshes are.
2104	
2105	STEPHANO	Trinculo, run into no further danger:
2106	interrupt the monster one word further, and,
2107	by this hand, I'll turn my mercy out o' doors
2108	and make a stock-fish of thee.
2109	
2110	TRINCULO	Why, what did I? I did nothing. I'll go farther
2111	off.
2112	
2113	STEPHANO	Didst thou not say he lied?
2114	
2115	ARIEL	Thou liest.
2116	
2117	STEPHANO	Do I so? take thou that.
2118	
2119	[Beats TRINCULO]
2120	
2121	As you like this, give me the lie another time.
2122	
2123	TRINCULO	I did not give the lie. Out o' your
2124	wits and bearing too? A pox o' your bottle!
2125	this can sack and drinking do. A murrain on
2126	your monster, and the devil take your fingers!
2127	
2128	CALIBAN	Ha, ha, ha!
2129	
2130	STEPHANO	Now, forward with your tale. Prithee, stand farther
2131	off.
2132	
2133	CALIBAN	Beat him enough: after a little time
2134	I'll beat him too.
2135	
2136	STEPHANO	                  Stand farther. Come, proceed.
2137	
2138	CALIBAN	Why, as I told thee, 'tis a custom with him,
2139	I' th' afternoon to sleep: there thou mayst brain him,
2140	Having first seized his books, or with a log
2141	Batter his skull, or paunch him with a stake,
2142	Or cut his wezand with thy knife. Remember
2143	First to possess his books; for without them
2144	He's but a sot, as I am, nor hath not
2145	One spirit to command: they all do hate him
2146	As rootedly as I. Burn but his books.
2147	He has brave utensils,--for so he calls them--
2148	Which when he has a house, he'll deck withal
2149	And that most deeply to consider is
2150	The beauty of his daughter; he himself
2151	Calls her a nonpareil: I never saw a woman,
2152	But only Sycorax my dam and she;
2153	But she as far surpasseth Sycorax
2154	As great'st does least.
2155	
2156	STEPHANO	Is it so brave a lass?
2157	
2158	CALIBAN	Ay, lord; she will become thy bed, I warrant.
2159	And bring thee forth brave brood.
2160	
2161	STEPHANO	Monster, I will kill this man: his daughter and I
2162	will be king and queen--save our graces!--and
2163	Trinculo and thyself shall be viceroys. Dost thou
2164	like the plot, Trinculo?
2165	
2166	TRINCULO	Excellent.
2167	
2168	STEPHANO	Give me thy hand: I am sorry I beat thee; but,
2169	while thou livest, keep a good tongue in thy head.
2170	
2171	CALIBAN	Within this half hour will he be asleep:
2172	Wilt thou destroy him then?
2173	
2174	STEPHANO	Ay, on mine honour.
2175	
2176	ARIEL	This will I tell my master.
2177	
2178	CALIBAN	Thou makest me merry; I am full of pleasure:
2179	Let us be jocund: will you troll the catch
2180	You taught me but while-ere?
2181	
2182	STEPHANO	At thy request, monster, I will do reason, any
2183	reason. Come on, Trinculo, let us sing.
2184	
2185	[Sings]
2186	
2187	Flout 'em and scout 'em
2188	And scout 'em and flout 'em
2189	Thought is free.
2190	
2191	CALIBAN	That's not the tune.
2192	
2193	[Ariel plays the tune on a tabour and pipe]
2194	
2195	STEPHANO	What is this same?
2196	
2197	TRINCULO	This is the tune of our catch, played by the picture
2198	of Nobody.
2199	
2200	STEPHANO	If thou beest a man, show thyself in thy likeness:
2201	if thou beest a devil, take't as thou list.
2202	
2203	TRINCULO	O, forgive me my sins!
2204	
2205	STEPHANO	He that dies pays all debts: I defy thee. Mercy upon us!
2206	
2207	CALIBAN	Art thou afeard?
2208	
2209	STEPHANO	No, monster, not I.
2210	
2211	CALIBAN	Be not afeard; the isle is full of noises,
2212	Sounds and sweet airs, that give delight and hurt not.
2213	Sometimes a thousand twangling instruments
2214	Will hum about mine ears, and sometime voices
2215	That, if I then had waked after long sleep,
2216	Will make me sleep again: and then, in dreaming,
2217	The clouds methought would open and show riches
2218	Ready to drop upon me that, when I waked,
2219	I cried to dream again.
2220	
2221	STEPHANO	This will prove a brave kingdom to me, where I shall
2222	have my music for nothing.
2223	
2224	CALIBAN	When Prospero is destroyed.
2225	
2226	STEPHANO	That shall be by and by: I remember the story.
2227	
2228	TRINCULO	The sound is going away; let's follow it, and
2229	after do our work.
2230	
2231	STEPHANO	Lead, monster; we'll follow. I would I could see
2232	this tabourer; he lays it on.
2233	
2234	TRINCULO	Wilt come? I'll follow, Stephano.
2235	
2236	[Exeunt]

2241	THE TEMPEST
2242	
2243	
2244	ACT III
2245	
2246	
2247	
2248	SCENE III	Another part of the island.
2249	
2250	
2251	[Enter ALONSO, SEBASTIAN, ANTONIO, GONZALO,
2252	ADRIAN, FRANCISCO, and others]
2253	
2254	GONZALO	By'r lakin, I can go no further, sir;
2255	My old bones ache: here's a maze trod indeed
2256	Through forth-rights and meanders! By your patience,
2257	I needs must rest me.
2258	
2259	ALONSO	Old lord, I cannot blame thee,
2260	Who am myself attach'd with weariness,
2261	To the dulling of my spirits: sit down, and rest.
2262	Even here I will put off my hope and keep it
2263	No longer for my flatterer: he is drown'd
2264	Whom thus we stray to find, and the sea mocks
2265	Our frustrate search on land. Well, let him go.
2266	
2267	ANTONIO	[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  I am right glad that he's so
2268	out of hope.
2269	Do not, for one repulse, forego the purpose
2270	That you resolved to effect.
2271	
2272	SEBASTIAN	[Aside to ANTONIO]  The next advantage
2273	Will we take throughly.
2274	
2275	ANTONIO	[Aside to SEBASTIAN]  Let it be to-night;
2276	For, now they are oppress'd with travel, they
2277	Will not, nor cannot, use such vigilance
2278	As when they are fresh.
2279	
2280	SEBASTIAN	[Aside to ANTONIO]  I say, to-night: no more.
2281	
2282	[Solemn and strange music]
2283	
2284	ALONSO	What harmony is this? My good friends, hark!
2285	
2286	GONZALO	Marvellous sweet music!
2287	
2288	[Enter PROSPERO above, invisible. Enter several
2289	strange Shapes, bringing in a banquet;
2290	they dance about it with gentle actions of
2291	salutation; and, inviting the King, &c. to
2292	eat, they depart]
2293	
2294	ALONSO	Give us kind keepers, heavens! What were these?
2295	
2296	SEBASTIAN	A living drollery. Now I will believe
2297	That there are unicorns, that in Arabia
2298	There is one tree, the phoenix' throne, one phoenix
2299	At this hour reigning there.
2300	
2301	ANTONIO	I'll believe both;
2302	And what does else want credit, come to me,
2303	And I'll be sworn 'tis true: travellers ne'er did
2304	lie,
2305	Though fools at home condemn 'em.
2306	
2307	GONZALO	If in Naples
2308	I should report this now, would they believe me?
2309	If I should say, I saw such islanders--
2310	For, certes, these are people of the island--
2311	Who, though they are of monstrous shape, yet, note,
2312	Their manners are more gentle-kind than of
2313	Our human generation you shall find
2314	Many, nay, almost any.
2315	
2316	PROSPERO	[Aside]              Honest lord,
2317	Thou hast said well; for some of you there present
2318	Are worse than devils.
2319	
2320	ALONSO	I cannot too much muse
2321	Such shapes, such gesture and such sound, expressing,
2322	Although they want the use of tongue, a kind
2323	Of excellent dumb discourse.
2324	
2325	PROSPERO	[Aside]	Praise in departing.
2326	
2327	FRANCISCO	They vanish'd strangely.
2328	
2329	SEBASTIAN	No matter, since
2330	They have left their viands behind; for we have stomachs.
2331	Will't please you taste of what is here?
2332	
2333	ALONSO	Not I.
2334	
2335	GONZALO	Faith, sir, you need not fear. When we were boys,
2336	Who would believe that there were mountaineers
2337	Dew-lapp'd like bulls, whose throats had hanging at 'em
2338	Wallets of flesh? or that there were such men
2339	Whose heads stood in their breasts? which now we find
2340	Each putter-out of five for one will bring us
2341	Good warrant of.
2342	
2343	ALONSO	                  I will stand to and feed,
2344	Although my last: no matter, since I feel
2345	The best is past. Brother, my lord the duke,
2346	Stand to and do as we.
2347	
2348	[Thunder and lightning. Enter ARIEL, like a
2349	harpy; claps his wings upon the table; and,
2350	with a quaint device, the banquet vanishes]
2351	
2352	ARIEL	You are three men of sin, whom Destiny,
2353	That hath to instrument this lower world
2354	And what is in't, the never-surfeited sea
2355	Hath caused to belch up you; and on this island
2356	Where man doth not inhabit; you 'mongst men
2357	Being most unfit to live. I have made you mad;
2358	And even with such-like valour men hang and drown
2359	Their proper selves.
2360	
2361	[ALONSO, SEBASTIAN &c. draw their swords]
2362	
2363	You fools! I and my fellows
2364	Are ministers of Fate: the elements,
2365	Of whom your swords are temper'd, may as well
2366	Wound the loud winds, or with bemock'd-at stabs
2367	Kill the still-closing waters, as diminish
2368	One dowle that's in my plume: my fellow-ministers
2369	Are like invulnerable. If you could hurt,
2370	Your swords are now too massy for your strengths
2371	And will not be uplifted. But remember--
2372	For that's my business to you--that you three
2373	From Milan did supplant good Prospero;
2374	Exposed unto the sea, which hath requit it,
2375	Him and his innocent child: for which foul deed
2376	The powers, delaying, not forgetting, have
2377	Incensed the seas and shores, yea, all the creatures,
2378	Against your peace. Thee of thy son, Alonso,
2379	They have bereft; and do pronounce by me:
2380	Lingering perdition, worse than any death
2381	Can be at once, shall step by step attend
2382	You and your ways; whose wraths to guard you from--
2383	Which here, in this most desolate isle, else falls
2384	Upon your heads--is nothing but heart-sorrow
2385	And a clear life ensuing.
2386	
2387	[He vanishes in thunder; then, to soft music
2388	enter the Shapes again, and dance, with
2389	mocks and mows, and carrying out the table]
2390	
2391	PROSPERO	Bravely the figure of this harpy hast thou
2392	Perform'd, my Ariel; a grace it had, devouring:
2393	Of my instruction hast thou nothing bated
2394	In what thou hadst to say: so, with good life
2395	And observation strange, my meaner ministers
2396	Their several kinds have done. My high charms work
2397	And these mine enemies are all knit up
2398	In their distractions; they now are in my power;
2399	And in these fits I leave them, while I visit
2400	Young Ferdinand, whom they suppose is drown'd,
2401	And his and mine loved darling.
2402	
2403	[Exit above]
2404	
2405	GONZALO	I' the name of something holy, sir, why stand you
2406	In this strange stare?
2407	
2408	ALONSO	O, it is monstrous, monstrous:
2409	Methought the billows spoke and told me of it;
2410	The winds did sing it to me, and the thunder,
2411	That deep and dreadful organ-pipe, pronounced
2412	The name of Prosper: it did bass my trespass.
2413	Therefore my son i' the ooze is bedded, and
2414	I'll seek him deeper than e'er plummet sounded
2415	And with him there lie mudded.
2416	[Exit]
2417	
2418	SEBASTIAN	But one fiend at a time,
2419	I'll fight their legions o'er.
2420	
2421	ANTONIO	I'll be thy second.
2422	
2423	[Exeunt SEBASTIAN, and ANTONIO]
2424	
2425	GONZALO	All three of them are desperate: their great guilt,
2426	Like poison given to work a great time after,
2427	Now 'gins to bite the spirits. I do beseech you
2428	That are of suppler joints, follow them swiftly
2429	And hinder them from what this ecstasy
2430	May now provoke them to.
2431	
2432	ADRIAN	Follow, I pray you.
2433	
2434	[Exeunt]
2435

2439	THE TEMPEST
2440	
2441	
2442	ACT IV
2443	
2444	
2445	
2446	SCENE I	Before PROSPERO'S cell.
2447	
2448	
2449	[Enter PROSPERO, FERDINAND, and MIRANDA]
2450	
2451	PROSPERO	If I have too austerely punish'd you,
2452	Your compensation makes amends, for I
2453	Have given you here a third of mine own life,
2454	Or that for which I live; who once again
2455	I tender to thy hand: all thy vexations
2456	Were but my trials of thy love and thou
2457	Hast strangely stood the test here, afore Heaven,
2458	I ratify this my rich gift. O Ferdinand,
2459	Do not smile at me that I boast her off,
2460	For thou shalt find she will outstrip all praise
2461	And make it halt behind her.
2462	
2463	FERDINAND	I do believe it
2464	Against an oracle.
2465	
2466	PROSPERO	Then, as my gift and thine own acquisition
2467	Worthily purchased take my daughter: but
2468	If thou dost break her virgin-knot before
2469	All sanctimonious ceremonies may
2470	With full and holy rite be minister'd,
2471	No sweet aspersion shall the heavens let fall
2472	To make this contract grow: but barren hate,
2473	Sour-eyed disdain and discord shall bestrew
2474	The union of your bed with weeds so loathly
2475	That you shall hate it both: therefore take heed,
2476	As Hymen's lamps shall light you.
2477	
2478	FERDINAND	As I hope
2479	For quiet days, fair issue and long life,
2480	With such love as 'tis now, the murkiest den,
2481	The most opportune place, the strong'st suggestion.
2482	Our worser genius can, shall never melt
2483	Mine honour into lust, to take away
2484	The edge of that day's celebration
2485	When I shall think: or Phoebus' steeds are founder'd,
2486	Or Night kept chain'd below.
2487	
2488	PROSPERO	Fairly spoke.
2489	Sit then and talk with her; she is thine own.
2490	What, Ariel! my industrious servant, Ariel!
2491	
2492	[Enter ARIEL]
2493	
2494	ARIEL	What would my potent master? here I am.
2495	
2496	PROSPERO	Thou and thy meaner fellows your last service
2497	Did worthily perform; and I must use you
2498	In such another trick. Go bring the rabble,
2499	O'er whom I give thee power, here to this place:
2500	Incite them to quick motion; for I must
2501	Bestow upon the eyes of this young couple
2502	Some vanity of mine art: it is my promise,
2503	And they expect it from me.
2504	
2505	ARIEL	Presently?
2506	
2507	PROSPERO	Ay, with a twink.
2508	
2509	ARIEL	   Before you can say 'come' and 'go,'
2510	And breathe twice and cry 'so, so,'
2511	Each one, tripping on his toe,
2512	Will be here with mop and mow.
2513	Do you love me, master? no?
2514	
2515	PROSPERO	Dearly my delicate Ariel. Do not approach
2516	Till thou dost hear me call.
2517	
2518	ARIEL	Well, I conceive.
2519	
2520	[Exit]
2521	
2522	PROSPERO	Look thou be true; do not give dalliance
2523	Too much the rein: the strongest oaths are straw
2524	To the fire i' the blood: be more abstemious,
2525	Or else, good night your vow!
2526	
2527	FERDINAND	I warrant you sir;
2528	The white cold virgin snow upon my heart
2529	Abates the ardour of my liver.
2530	
2531	PROSPERO	Well.
2532	Now come, my Ariel! bring a corollary,
2533	Rather than want a spirit: appear and pertly!
2534	No tongue! all eyes! be silent.
2535	
2536	[Soft music]
2537	
2538	[Enter IRIS]
2539	
2540	IRIS	Ceres, most bounteous lady, thy rich leas
2541	Of wheat, rye, barley, vetches, oats and pease;
2542	Thy turfy mountains, where live nibbling sheep,
2543	And flat meads thatch'd with stover, them to keep;
2544	Thy banks with pioned and twilled brims,
2545	Which spongy April at thy hest betrims,
2546	To make cold nymphs chaste crowns; and thy broom -groves,
2547	Whose shadow the dismissed bachelor loves,
2548	Being lass-lorn: thy pole-clipt vineyard;
2549	And thy sea-marge, sterile and rocky-hard,
2550	Where thou thyself dost air;--the queen o' the sky,
2551	Whose watery arch and messenger am I,
2552	Bids thee leave these, and with her sovereign grace,
2553	Here on this grass-plot, in this very place,
2554	To come and sport: her peacocks fly amain:
2555	Approach, rich Ceres, her to entertain.
2556	
2557	[Enter CERES]
2558	
2559	CERES	Hail, many-colour'd messenger, that ne'er
2560	Dost disobey the wife of Jupiter;
2561	Who with thy saffron wings upon my flowers
2562	Diffusest honey-drops, refreshing showers,
2563	And with each end of thy blue bow dost crown
2564	My bosky acres and my unshrubb'd down,
2565	Rich scarf to my proud earth; why hath thy queen
2566	Summon'd me hither, to this short-grass'd green?
2567	
2568	IRIS	A contract of true love to celebrate;
2569	And some donation freely to estate
2570	On the blest lovers.
2571	
2572	CERES	Tell me, heavenly bow,
2573	If Venus or her son, as thou dost know,
2574	Do now attend the queen? Since they did plot
2575	The means that dusky Dis my daughter got,
2576	Her and her blind boy's scandal'd company
2577	I have forsworn.
2578	
2579	IRIS	                  Of her society
2580	Be not afraid: I met her deity
2581	Cutting the clouds towards Paphos and her son
2582	Dove-drawn with her. Here thought they to have done
2583	Some wanton charm upon this man and maid,
2584	Whose vows are, that no bed-right shall be paid
2585	Till Hymen's torch be lighted: but vain;
2586	Mars's hot minion is returned again;
2587	Her waspish-headed son has broke his arrows,
2588	Swears he will shoot no more but play with sparrows
2589	And be a boy right out.
2590	
2591	CERES	High'st queen of state,
2592	Great Juno, comes; I know her by her gait.
2593	
2594	[Enter JUNO]
2595	
2596	JUNO	How does my bounteous sister? Go with me
2597	To bless this twain, that they may prosperous be
2598	And honour'd in their issue.
2599	
2600	[They sing:]
2601	
2602	JUNO	   Honour, riches, marriage-blessing,
2603	Long continuance, and increasing,
2604	Hourly joys be still upon you!
2605	Juno sings her blessings upon you.
2606	
2607	CERES	   Earth's increase, foison plenty,
2608	Barns and garners never empty,
2609	Vines and clustering bunches growing,
2610	Plants with goodly burthen bowing;
2611	Spring come to you at the farthest
2612	In the very end of harvest!
2613	Scarcity and want shall shun you;
2614	Ceres' blessing so is on you.
2615	
2616	FERDINAND	This is a most majestic vision, and
2617	Harmoniously charmingly. May I be bold
2618	To think these spirits?
2619	
2620	PROSPERO	Spirits, which by mine art
2621	I have from their confines call'd to enact
2622	My present fancies.
2623	
2624	FERDINAND	Let me live here ever;
2625	So rare a wonder'd father and a wife
2626	Makes this place Paradise.
2627	
2628	[Juno and Ceres whisper, and send Iris on
2629	employment]
2630	
2631	PROSPERO	Sweet, now, silence!
2632	Juno and Ceres whisper seriously;
2633	There's something else to do: hush, and be mute,
2634	Or else our spell is marr'd.
2635	
2636	IRIS	You nymphs, call'd Naiads, of the windring brooks,
2637	With your sedged crowns and ever-harmless looks,
2638	Leave your crisp channels and on this green land
2639	Answer your summons; Juno does command:
2640	Come, temperate nymphs, and help to celebrate
2641	A contract of true love; be not too late.
2642	
2643	[Enter certain Nymphs]
2644	
2645	You sunburnt sicklemen, of August weary,
2646	Come hither from the furrow and be merry:
2647	Make holiday; your rye-straw hats put on
2648	And these fresh nymphs encounter every one
2649	In country footing.
2650	
2651	[Enter certain Reapers, properly habited: they
2652	join with the Nymphs in a graceful dance;
2653	towards the end whereof PROSPERO starts
2654	suddenly, and speaks; after which, to a
2655	strange, hollow, and confused noise, they
2656	heavily vanish]
2657	
2658	PROSPERO	[Aside]  I had forgot that foul conspiracy
2659	Of the beast Caliban and his confederates
2660	Against my life: the minute of their plot
2661	Is almost come.
2662	
2663	[To the Spirits]
2664	
2665	Well done! avoid; no more!
2666	
2667	FERDINAND	This is strange: your father's in some passion
2668	That works him strongly.
2669	
2670	MIRANDA	Never till this day
2671	Saw I him touch'd with anger so distemper'd.
2672	
2673	PROSPERO	You do look, my son, in a moved sort,
2674	As if you were dismay'd: be cheerful, sir.
2675	Our revels now are ended. These our actors,
2676	As I foretold you, were all spirits and
2677	Are melted into air, into thin air:
2678	And, like the baseless fabric of this vision,
2679	The cloud-capp'd towers, the gorgeous palaces,
2680	The solemn temples, the great globe itself,
2681	Ye all which it inherit, shall dissolve
2682	And, like this insubstantial pageant faded,
2683	Leave not a rack behind. We are such stuff
2684	As dreams are made on, and our little life
2685	Is rounded with a sleep. Sir, I am vex'd;
2686	Bear with my weakness; my, brain is troubled:
2687	Be not disturb'd with my infirmity:
2688	If you be pleased, retire into my cell
2689	And there repose: a turn or two I'll walk,
2690	To still my beating mind.
2691	
2692	
2693	FERDINAND	|
2694	|  We wish your peace.
2695	MIRANDA	|
2696	
2697	
2698	[Exeunt]
2699	
2700	PROSPERO	Come with a thought I thank thee, Ariel: come.
2701	
2702	[Enter ARIEL]
2703	
2704	ARIEL	Thy thoughts I cleave to. What's thy pleasure?
2705	
2706	PROSPERO	Spirit,
2707	We must prepare to meet with Caliban.
2708	
2709	ARIEL	Ay, my commander: when I presented Ceres,
2710	I thought to have told thee of it, but I fear'd
2711	Lest I might anger thee.
2712	
2713	PROSPERO	Say again, where didst thou leave these varlets?
2714	
2715	ARIEL	I told you, sir, they were red-hot with drinking;
2716	So fun of valour that they smote the air
2717	For breathing in their faces; beat the ground
2718	For kissing of their feet; yet always bending
2719	Towards their project. Then I beat my tabour;
2720	At which, like unback'd colts, they prick'd
2721	their ears,
2722	Advanced their eyelids, lifted up their noses
2723	As they smelt music: so I charm'd their ears
2724	That calf-like they my lowing follow'd through
2725	Tooth'd briers, sharp furzes, pricking goss and thorns,
2726	Which entered their frail shins: at last I left them
2727	I' the filthy-mantled pool beyond your cell,
2728	There dancing up to the chins, that the foul lake
2729	O'erstunk their feet.
2730	
2731	PROSPERO	This was well done, my bird.
2732	Thy shape invisible retain thou still:
2733	The trumpery in my house, go bring it hither,
2734	For stale to catch these thieves.
2735	
2736	ARIEL	I go, I go.
2737	
2738	[Exit]
2739	
2740	PROSPERO	A devil, a born devil, on whose nature
2741	Nurture can never stick; on whom my pains,
2742	Humanely taken, all, all lost, quite lost;
2743	And as with age his body uglier grows,
2744	So his mind cankers. I will plague them all,
2745	Even to roaring.
2746	
2747	[Re-enter ARIEL, loaden with glistering apparel, &c]
2748	
2749	Come, hang them on this line.
2750	
2751	[PROSPERO and ARIEL remain invisible. Enter
2752	CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, all wet]
2753	
2754	CALIBAN	Pray you, tread softly, that the blind mole may not
2755	Hear a foot fall: we now are near his cell.
2756	
2757	STEPHANO	Monster, your fairy, which you say is
2758	a harmless fairy, has done little better than
2759	played the Jack with us.
2760	
2761	TRINCULO	Monster, I do smell all horse-piss; at
2762	which my nose is in great indignation.
2763	
2764	STEPHANO	So is mine. Do you hear, monster? If I should take
2765	a displeasure against you, look you,--
2766	
2767	TRINCULO	Thou wert but a lost monster.
2768	
2769	CALIBAN	Good my lord, give me thy favour still.
2770	Be patient, for the prize I'll bring thee to
2771	Shall hoodwink this mischance: therefore speak softly.
2772	All's hush'd as midnight yet.
2773	
2774	TRINCULO	Ay, but to lose our bottles in the pool,--
2775	
2776	STEPHANO	There is not only disgrace and dishonour in that,
2777	monster, but an infinite loss.
2778	
2779	TRINCULO	That's more to me than my wetting: yet this is your
2780	harmless fairy, monster.
2781	
2782	STEPHANO	I will fetch off my bottle, though I be o'er ears
2783	for my labour.
2784	
2785	CALIBAN	Prithee, my king, be quiet. Seest thou here,
2786	This is the mouth o' the cell: no noise, and enter.
2787	Do that good mischief which may make this island
2788	Thine own for ever, and I, thy Caliban,
2789	For aye thy foot-licker.
2790	
2791	STEPHANO	Give me thy hand. I do begin to have bloody thoughts.
2792	
2793	TRINCULO	O king Stephano! O peer! O worthy Stephano! look
2794	what a wardrobe here is for thee!
2795	
2796	CALIBAN	Let it alone, thou fool; it is but trash.
2797	
2798	TRINCULO	O, ho, monster! we know what belongs to a frippery.
2799	O king Stephano!
2800	
2801	STEPHANO	Put off that gown, Trinculo; by this hand, I'll have
2802	that gown.
2803	
2804	TRINCULO	Thy grace shall have it.
2805	
2806	CALIBAN	The dropsy drown this fool I what do you mean
2807	To dote thus on such luggage? Let's alone
2808	And do the murder first: if he awake,
2809	From toe to crown he'll fill our skins with pinches,
2810	Make us strange stuff.
2811	
2812	STEPHANO	Be you quiet, monster. Mistress line,
2813	is not this my jerkin? Now is the jerkin under
2814	the line: now, jerkin, you are like to lose your
2815	hair and prove a bald jerkin.
2816	
2817	TRINCULO	Do, do: we steal by line and level, an't like your grace.
2818	
2819	STEPHANO	I thank thee for that jest; here's a garment for't:
2820	wit shall not go unrewarded while I am king of this
2821	country. 'Steal by line and level' is an excellent
2822	pass of pate; there's another garment for't.
2823	
2824	TRINCULO	Monster, come, put some lime upon your fingers, and
2825	away with the rest.
2826	
2827	CALIBAN	I will have none on't: we shall lose our time,
2828	And all be turn'd to barnacles, or to apes
2829	With foreheads villanous low.
2830	
2831	STEPHANO	Monster, lay-to your fingers: help to bear this
2832	away where my hogshead of wine is, or I'll turn you
2833	out of my kingdom: go to, carry this.
2834	
2835	TRINCULO	And this.
2836	
2837	STEPHANO	Ay, and this.
2838	
2839	[A noise of hunters heard. Enter divers Spirits,
2840	in shape of dogs and hounds, and hunt them about,
2841	PROSPERO and ARIEL setting them on]
2842	
2843	PROSPERO	Hey, Mountain, hey!
2844	
2845	ARIEL	Silver I there it goes, Silver!
2846	
2847	PROSPERO	Fury, Fury! there, Tyrant, there! hark! hark!
2848	
2849	[CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO, are
2850	driven out]
2851	
2852	Go charge my goblins that they grind their joints
2853	With dry convulsions, shorten up their sinews
2854	With aged cramps, and more pinch-spotted make them
2855	Than pard or cat o' mountain.
2856	
2857	ARIEL	Hark, they roar!
2858	
2859	PROSPERO	Let them be hunted soundly. At this hour
2860	Lie at my mercy all mine enemies:
2861	Shortly shall all my labours end, and thou
2862	Shalt have the air at freedom: for a little
2863	Follow, and do me service.
2864	
2865	[Exeunt]
2866	
2867	
2868	
2869	
2870	THE TEMPEST
2871	
2872	
2873	ACT V
2874	
2875	
2876	
2877	SCENE I	Before PROSPERO'S cell.
2878	
2879	
2880	[Enter PROSPERO in his magic robes, and ARIEL]
2881	
2882	PROSPERO	Now does my project gather to a head:
2883	My charms crack not; my spirits obey; and time
2884	Goes upright with his carriage. How's the day?
2885	
2886	ARIEL	On the sixth hour; at which time, my lord,
2887	You said our work should cease.
2888	
2889	PROSPERO	I did say so,
2890	When first I raised the tempest. Say, my spirit,
2891	How fares the king and's followers?
2892	
2893	ARIEL	Confined together
2894	In the same fashion as you gave in charge,
2895	Just as you left them; all prisoners, sir,
2896	In the line-grove which weather-fends your cell;
2897	They cannot budge till your release. The king,
2898	His brother and yours, abide all three distracted
2899	And the remainder mourning over them,
2900	Brimful of sorrow and dismay; but chiefly
2901	Him that you term'd, sir, 'The good old lord Gonzalo;'
2902	His tears run down his beard, like winter's drops
2903	From eaves of reeds. Your charm so strongly works 'em
2904	That if you now beheld them, your affections
2905	Would become tender.
2906	
2907	PROSPERO	Dost thou think so, spirit?
2908	
2909	ARIEL	Mine would, sir, were I human.
2910	
2911	PROSPERO	And mine shall.
2912	Hast thou, which art but air, a touch, a feeling
2913	Of their afflictions, and shall not myself,
2914	One of their kind, that relish all as sharply,
2915	Passion as they, be kindlier moved than thou art?
2916	Though with their high wrongs I am struck to the quick,
2917	Yet with my nobler reason 'gaitist my fury
2918	Do I take part: the rarer action is
2919	In virtue than in vengeance: they being penitent,
2920	The sole drift of my purpose doth extend
2921	Not a frown further. Go release them, Ariel:
2922	My charms I'll break, their senses I'll restore,
2923	And they shall be themselves.
2924	
2925	ARIEL	I'll fetch them, sir.
2926	
2927	[Exit]
2928	
2929	PROSPERO	Ye elves of hills, brooks, standing lakes and groves,
2930	And ye that on the sands with printless foot
2931	Do chase the ebbing Neptune and do fly him
2932	When he comes back; you demi-puppets that
2933	By moonshine do the green sour ringlets make,
2934	Whereof the ewe not bites, and you whose pastime
2935	Is to make midnight mushrooms, that rejoice
2936	To hear the solemn curfew; by whose aid,
2937	Weak masters though ye be, I have bedimm'd
2938	The noontide sun, call'd forth the mutinous winds,
2939	And 'twixt the green sea and the azured vault
2940	Set roaring war: to the dread rattling thunder
2941	Have I given fire and rifted Jove's stout oak
2942	With his own bolt; the strong-based promontory
2943	Have I made shake and by the spurs pluck'd up
2944	The pine and cedar: graves at my command
2945	Have waked their sleepers, oped, and let 'em forth
2946	By my so potent art. But this rough magic
2947	I here abjure, and, when I have required
2948	Some heavenly music, which even now I do,
2949	To work mine end upon their senses that
2950	This airy charm is for, I'll break my staff,
2951	Bury it certain fathoms in the earth,
2952	And deeper than did ever plummet sound
2953	I'll drown my book.
2954	
2955	[Solemn music]
2956	
2957	[Re-enter ARIEL before: then ALONSO, with a
2958	frantic gesture, attended by GONZALO;
2959	SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO in like manner,
2960	attended by ADRIAN and FRANCISCO   they all
2961	enter the circle which PROSPERO had made,
2962	and there stand charmed; which PROSPERO
2963	observing, speaks:]
2964	
2965	A solemn air and the best comforter
2966	To an unsettled fancy cure thy brains,
2967	Now useless, boil'd within thy skull! There stand,
2968	For you are spell-stopp'd.
2969	Holy Gonzalo, honourable man,
2970	Mine eyes, even sociable to the show of thine,
2971	Fall fellowly drops. The charm dissolves apace,
2972	And as the morning steals upon the night,
2973	Melting the darkness, so their rising senses
2974	Begin to chase the ignorant fumes that mantle
2975	Their clearer reason. O good Gonzalo,
2976	My true preserver, and a loyal sir
2977	To him you follow'st! I will pay thy graces
2978	Home both in word and deed. Most cruelly
2979	Didst thou, Alonso, use me and my daughter:
2980	Thy brother was a furtherer in the act.
2981	Thou art pinch'd fort now, Sebastian. Flesh and blood,
2982	You, brother mine, that entertain'd ambition,
2983	Expell'd remorse and nature; who, with Sebastian,
2984	Whose inward pinches therefore are most strong,
2985	Would here have kill'd your king; I do forgive thee,
2986	Unnatural though thou art. Their understanding
2987	Begins to swell, and the approaching tide
2988	Will shortly fill the reasonable shore
2989	That now lies foul and muddy. Not one of them
2990	That yet looks on me, or would know me Ariel,
2991	Fetch me the hat and rapier in my cell:
2992	I will discase me, and myself present
2993	As I was sometime Milan: quickly, spirit;
2994	Thou shalt ere long be free.
2995	
2996	[ARIEL sings and helps to attire him]
2997	
2998	Where the bee sucks. there suck I:
2999	In a cowslip's bell I lie;
3000	There I couch when owls do cry.
3001	On the bat's back I do fly
3002	After summer merrily.
3003	Merrily, merrily shall I live now
3004	Under the blossom that hangs on the bough.
3005	
3006	PROSPERO	Why, that's my dainty Ariel! I shall miss thee:
3007	But yet thou shalt have freedom: so, so, so.
3008	To the king's ship, invisible as thou art:
3009	There shalt thou find the mariners asleep
3010	Under the hatches; the master and the boatswain
3011	Being awake, enforce them to this place,
3012	And presently, I prithee.
3013	
3014	ARIEL	I drink the air before me, and return
3015	Or ere your pulse twice beat.
3016	
3017	[Exit]
3018	
3019	GONZALO	All torment, trouble, wonder and amazement
3020	Inhabits here: some heavenly power guide us
3021	Out of this fearful country!
3022	
3023	PROSPERO	Behold, sir king,
3024	The wronged Duke of Milan, Prospero:
3025	For more assurance that a living prince
3026	Does now speak to thee, I embrace thy body;
3027	And to thee and thy company I bid
3028	A hearty welcome.
3029	
3030	ALONSO	                  Whether thou best he or no,
3031	Or some enchanted trifle to abuse me,
3032	As late I have been, I not know: thy pulse
3033	Beats as of flesh and blood; and, since I saw thee,
3034	The affliction of my mind amends, with which,
3035	I fear, a madness held me: this must crave,
3036	An if this be at all, a most strange story.
3037	Thy dukedom I resign and do entreat
3038	Thou pardon me my wrongs. But how should Prospero
3039	Be living and be here?
3040	
3041	PROSPERO	First, noble friend,
3042	Let me embrace thine age, whose honour cannot
3043	Be measured or confined.
3044	
3045	GONZALO	Whether this be
3046	Or be not, I'll not swear.
3047	
3048	PROSPERO	You do yet taste
3049	Some subtilties o' the isle, that will not let you
3050	Believe things certain. Welcome, my friends all!
3051	
3052	[Aside to SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]
3053	
3054	But you, my brace of lords, were I so minded,
3055	I here could pluck his highness' frown upon you
3056	And justify you traitors: at this time
3057	I will tell no tales.
3058	
3059	SEBASTIAN	[Aside]  The devil speaks in him.
3060	
3061	PROSPERO	No.
3062	For you, most wicked sir, whom to call brother
3063	Would even infect my mouth, I do forgive
3064	Thy rankest fault; all of them; and require
3065	My dukedom of thee, which perforce, I know,
3066	Thou must restore.
3067	
3068	ALONSO	                  If thou be'st Prospero,
3069	Give us particulars of thy preservation;
3070	How thou hast met us here, who three hours since
3071	Were wreck'd upon this shore; where I have lost--
3072	How sharp the point of this remembrance is!--
3073	My dear son Ferdinand.
3074	
3075	PROSPERO	I am woe for't, sir.
3076	
3077	ALONSO	Irreparable is the loss, and patience
3078	Says it is past her cure.
3079	
3080	PROSPERO	I rather think
3081	You have not sought her help, of whose soft grace
3082	For the like loss I have her sovereign aid
3083	And rest myself content.
3084	
3085	ALONSO	You the like loss!
3086	
3087	PROSPERO	As great to me as late; and, supportable
3088	To make the dear loss, have I means much weaker
3089	Than you may call to comfort you, for I
3090	Have lost my daughter.
3091	
3092	ALONSO	A daughter?
3093	O heavens, that they were living both in Naples,
3094	The king and queen there! that they were, I wish
3095	Myself were mudded in that oozy bed
3096	Where my son lies. When did you lose your daughter?
3097	
3098	PROSPERO	In this last tempest. I perceive these lords
3099	At this encounter do so much admire
3100	That they devour their reason and scarce think
3101	Their eyes do offices of truth, their words
3102	Are natural breath: but, howsoe'er you have
3103	Been justled from your senses, know for certain
3104	That I am Prospero and that very duke
3105	Which was thrust forth of Milan, who most strangely
3106	Upon this shore, where you were wreck'd, was landed,
3107	To be the lord on't. No more yet of this;
3108	For 'tis a chronicle of day by day,
3109	Not a relation for a breakfast nor
3110	Befitting this first meeting. Welcome, sir;
3111	This cell's my court: here have I few attendants
3112	And subjects none abroad: pray you, look in.
3113	My dukedom since you have given me again,
3114	I will requite you with as good a thing;
3115	At least bring forth a wonder, to content ye
3116	As much as me my dukedom.
3117	
3118	[Here PROSPERO discovers FERDINAND and MIRANDA
3119	playing at chess]
3120	
3121	MIRANDA	Sweet lord, you play me false.
3122	
3123	FERDINAND	No, my dear'st love,
3124	I would not for the world.
3125	
3126	MIRANDA	Yes, for a score of kingdoms you should wrangle,
3127	And I would call it, fair play.
3128	
3129	ALONSO	If this prove
3130	A vision of the Island, one dear son
3131	Shall I twice lose.
3132	
3133	SEBASTIAN	A most high miracle!
3134	
3135	FERDINAND	Though the seas threaten, they are merciful;
3136	I have cursed them without cause.
3137	
3138	[Kneels]
3139	
3140	ALONSO	Now all the blessings
3141	Of a glad father compass thee about!
3142	Arise, and say how thou camest here.
3143	
3144	MIRANDA	O, wonder!
3145	How many goodly creatures are there here!
3146	How beauteous mankind is! O brave new world,
3147	That has such people in't!
3148	
3149	PROSPERO	'Tis new to thee.
3150	
3151	ALONSO	What is this maid with whom thou wast at play?
3152	Your eld'st acquaintance cannot be three hours:
3153	Is she the goddess that hath sever'd us,
3154	And brought us thus together?
3155	
3156	FERDINAND	Sir, she is mortal;
3157	But by immortal Providence she's mine:
3158	I chose her when I could not ask my father
3159	For his advice, nor thought I had one. She
3160	Is daughter to this famous Duke of Milan,
3161	Of whom so often I have heard renown,
3162	But never saw before; of whom I have
3163	Received a second life; and second father
3164	This lady makes him to me.
3165	
3166	ALONSO	I am hers:
3167	But, O, how oddly will it sound that I
3168	Must ask my child forgiveness!
3169	
3170	PROSPERO	There, sir, stop:
3171	Let us not burthen our remembrance with
3172	A heaviness that's gone.
3173	
3174	GONZALO	I have inly wept,
3175	Or should have spoke ere this. Look down, you god,
3176	And on this couple drop a blessed crown!
3177	For it is you that have chalk'd forth the way
3178	Which brought us hither.
3179	
3180	ALONSO	I say, Amen, Gonzalo!
3181	
3182	GONZALO	Was Milan thrust from Milan, that his issue
3183	Should become kings of Naples? O, rejoice
3184	Beyond a common joy, and set it down
3185	With gold on lasting pillars: In one voyage
3186	Did Claribel her husband find at Tunis,
3187	And Ferdinand, her brother, found a wife
3188	Where he himself was lost, Prospero his dukedom
3189	In a poor isle and all of us ourselves
3190	When no man was his own.
3191	
3192	ALONSO	[To FERDINAND and MIRANDA]  Give me your hands:
3193	Let grief and sorrow still embrace his heart
3194	That doth not wish you joy!
3195	
3196	GONZALO	Be it so! Amen!
3197	
3198	[Re-enter ARIEL, with the Master and Boatswain
3199	amazedly following]
3200	
3201	O, look, sir, look, sir! here is more of us:
3202	I prophesied, if a gallows were on land,
3203	This fellow could not drown. Now, blasphemy,
3204	That swear'st grace o'erboard, not an oath on shore?
3205	Hast thou no mouth by land? What is the news?
3206	
3207	Boatswain	The best news is, that we have safely found
3208	Our king and company; the next, our ship--
3209	Which, but three glasses since, we gave out split--
3210	Is tight and yare and bravely rigg'd as when
3211	We first put out to sea.
3212	
3213	ARIEL	[Aside to PROSPERO]  Sir, all this service
3214	Have I done since I went.
3215	
3216	PROSPERO	[Aside to ARIEL]  My tricksy spirit!
3217	
3218	ALONSO	These are not natural events; they strengthen
3219	From strange to stranger. Say, how came you hither?
3220	
3221	Boatswain	If I did think, sir, I were well awake,
3222	I'ld strive to tell you. We were dead of sleep,
3223	And--how we know not--all clapp'd under hatches;
3224	Where but even now with strange and several noises
3225	Of roaring, shrieking, howling, jingling chains,
3226	And more diversity of sounds, all horrible,
3227	We were awaked; straightway, at liberty;
3228	Where we, in all her trim, freshly beheld
3229	Our royal, good and gallant ship, our master
3230	Capering to eye her: on a trice, so please you,
3231	Even in a dream, were we divided from them
3232	And were brought moping hither.
3233	
3234	ARIEL	[Aside to PROSPERO]          Was't well done?
3235	
3236	PROSPERO	[Aside to ARIEL]  Bravely, my diligence. Thou shalt be free.
3237	
3238	ALONSO	This is as strange a maze as e'er men trod
3239	And there is in this business more than nature
3240	Was ever conduct of: some oracle
3241	Must rectify our knowledge.
3242	
3243	PROSPERO	Sir, my liege,
3244	Do not infest your mind with beating on
3245	The strangeness of this business; at pick'd leisure
3246	Which shall be shortly, single I'll resolve you,
3247	Which to you shall seem probable, of every
3248	These happen'd accidents; till when, be cheerful
3249	And think of each thing well.
3250	
3251	[Aside to ARIEL]
3252	
3253	Come hither, spirit:
3254	Set Caliban and his companions free;
3255	Untie the spell.
3256	
3257	[Exit ARIEL]
3258	
3259	How fares my gracious sir?
3260	There are yet missing of your company
3261	Some few odd lads that you remember not.
3262	
3263	[Re-enter ARIEL, driving in CALIBAN, STEPHANO
3264	and TRINCULO, in their stolen apparel]
3265	
3266	STEPHANO	Every man shift for all the rest, and
3267	let no man take care for himself; for all is
3268	but fortune. Coragio, bully-monster, coragio!
3269	
3270	TRINCULO	If these be true spies which I wear in my head,
3271	here's a goodly sight.
3272	
3273	CALIBAN	O Setebos, these be brave spirits indeed!
3274	How fine my master is! I am afraid
3275	He will chastise me.
3276	
3277	SEBASTIAN	Ha, ha!
3278	What things are these, my lord Antonio?
3279	Will money buy 'em?
3280	
3281	ANTONIO	Very like; one of them
3282	Is a plain fish, and, no doubt, marketable.
3283	
3284	PROSPERO	Mark but the badges of these men, my lords,
3285	Then say if they be true. This mis-shapen knave,
3286	His mother was a witch, and one so strong
3287	That could control the moon, make flows and ebbs,
3288	And deal in her command without her power.
3289	These three have robb'd me; and this demi-devil--
3290	For he's a bastard one--had plotted with them
3291	To take my life. Two of these fellows you
3292	Must know and own; this thing of darkness!
3293	Acknowledge mine.
3294	
3295	CALIBAN	                  I shall be pinch'd to death.
3296	
3297	ALONSO	Is not this Stephano, my drunken butler?
3298	
3299	SEBASTIAN	He is drunk now: where had he wine?
3300	
3301	ALONSO	And Trinculo is reeling ripe: where should they
3302	Find this grand liquor that hath gilded 'em?
3303	How camest thou in this pickle?
3304	
3305	TRINCULO	I have been in such a pickle since I
3306	saw you last that, I fear me, will never out of
3307	my bones: I shall not fear fly-blowing.
3308	
3309	SEBASTIAN	Why, how now, Stephano!
3310	
3311	STEPHANO	O, touch me not; I am not Stephano, but a cramp.
3312	
3313	PROSPERO	You'ld be king o' the isle, sirrah?
3314	
3315	STEPHANO	I should have been a sore one then.
3316	
3317	ALONSO	This is a strange thing as e'er I look'd on.
3318	
3319	[Pointing to Caliban]
3320	
3321	PROSPERO	He is as disproportion'd in his manners
3322	As in his shape. Go, sirrah, to my cell;
3323	Take with you your companions; as you look
3324	To have my pardon, trim it handsomely.
3325	
3326	CALIBAN	Ay, that I will; and I'll be wise hereafter
3327	And seek for grace. What a thrice-double ass
3328	Was I, to take this drunkard for a god
3329	And worship this dull fool!
3330	
3331	PROSPERO	Go to; away!
3332	
3333	ALONSO	Hence, and bestow your luggage where you found it.
3334	
3335	SEBASTIAN	Or stole it, rather.
3336	
3337	[Exeunt CALIBAN, STEPHANO, and TRINCULO]
3338	
3339	PROSPERO	Sir, I invite your highness and your train
3340	To my poor cell, where you shall take your rest
3341	For this one night; which, part of it, I'll waste
3342	With such discourse as, I not doubt, shall make it
3343	Go quick away; the story of my life
3344	And the particular accidents gone by
3345	Since I came to this isle: and in the morn
3346	I'll bring you to your ship and so to Naples,
3347	Where I have hope to see the nuptial
3348	Of these our dear-beloved solemnized;
3349	And thence retire me to my Milan, where
3350	Every third thought shall be my grave.
3351	
3352	ALONSO	I long
3353	To hear the story of your life, which must
3354	Take the ear strangely.
3355	
3356	PROSPERO	I'll deliver all;
3357	And promise you calm seas, auspicious gales
3358	And sail so expeditious that shall catch
3359	Your royal fleet far off.
3360	
3361	[Aside to ARIEL]
3362	
3363	My Ariel, chick,
3364	That is thy charge: then to the elements
3365	Be free, and fare thou well! Please you, draw near.
3366	
3367	[Exeunt]
3368

3372	THE TEMPEST
3373	
3374	EPILOGUE
3375	
3376	
3377	SPOKEN BY PROSPERO
3378	
3379	Now my charms are all o'erthrown,
3380	And what strength I have's mine own,
3381	Which is most faint: now, 'tis true,
3382	I must be here confined by you,
3383	Or sent to Naples. Let me not,
3384	Since I have my dukedom got
3385	And pardon'd the deceiver, dwell
3386	In this bare island by your spell;
3387	But release me from my bands
3388	With the help of your good hands:
3389	Gentle breath of yours my sails
3390	Must fill, or else my project fails,
3391	Which was to please. Now I want
3392	Spirits to enforce, art to enchant,
3393	And my ending is despair,
3394	Unless I be relieved by prayer,
3395	Which pierces so that it assaults
3396	Mercy itself and frees all faults.
3397	As you from crimes would pardon'd be,
3398	Let your indulgence set me free.

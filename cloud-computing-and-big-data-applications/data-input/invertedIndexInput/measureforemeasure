75	ESCALUS	My lord.
76	
77	DUKE VINCENTIO	Of government the properties to unfold,
78	Would seem in me to affect speech and discourse;
79	Since I am put to know that your own science
80	Exceeds, in that, the lists of all advice
81	My strength can give you: then no more remains,
82	But that to your sufficiency [           ]
83	[                  ] as your Worth is able,
84	And let them work. The nature of our people,
85	Our city's institutions, and the terms
86	For common justice, you're as pregnant in
87	As art and practise hath enriched any
88	That we remember. There is our commission,
89	From which we would not have you warp. Call hither,
90	I say, bid come before us Angelo.
91	
92	[Exit an Attendant]
93	
94	What figure of us think you he will bear?
95	For you must know, we have with special soul
96	Elected him our absence to supply,
97	Lent him our terror, dress'd him with our love,
98	And given his deputation all the organs
99	Of our own power: what think you of it?
100	
101	ESCALUS	If any in Vienna be of worth
102	To undergo such ample grace and honour,
103	It is Lord Angelo.
104	
105	DUKE VINCENTIO	                  Look where he comes.
106	
107	[Enter ANGELO]
108	
109	ANGELO	Always obedient to your grace's will,
110	I come to know your pleasure.
111	
112	DUKE VINCENTIO	Angelo,
113	There is a kind of character in thy life,
114	That to the observer doth thy history
115	Fully unfold. Thyself and thy belongings
116	Are not thine own so proper as to waste
117	Thyself upon thy virtues, they on thee.
118	Heaven doth with us as we with torches do,
119	Not light them for themselves; for if our virtues
120	Did not go forth of us, 'twere all alike
121	As if we had them not. Spirits are not finely touch'd
122	But to fine issues, nor Nature never lends
123	The smallest scruple of her excellence
124	But, like a thrifty goddess, she determines
125	Herself the glory of a creditor,
126	Both thanks and use. But I do bend my speech
127	To one that can my part in him advertise;
128	Hold therefore, Angelo:--
129	In our remove be thou at full ourself;
130	Mortality and mercy in Vienna
131	Live in thy tongue and heart: old Escalus,
132	Though first in question, is thy secondary.
133	Take thy commission.
134	
135	ANGELO	Now, good my lord,
136	Let there be some more test made of my metal,
137	Before so noble and so great a figure
138	Be stamp'd upon it.
139	
140	DUKE VINCENTIO	No more evasion:
141	We have with a leaven'd and prepared choice
142	Proceeded to you; therefore take your honours.
143	Our haste from hence is of so quick condition
144	That it prefers itself and leaves unquestion'd
145	Matters of needful value. We shall write to you,
146	As time and our concernings shall importune,
147	How it goes with us, and do look to know
148	What doth befall you here. So, fare you well;
149	To the hopeful execution do I leave you
150	Of your commissions.
151	
152	ANGELO	Yet give leave, my lord,
153	That we may bring you something on the way.
154	
155	DUKE VINCENTIO	My haste may not admit it;
156	Nor need you, on mine honour, have to do
157	With any scruple; your scope is as mine own
158	So to enforce or qualify the laws
159	As to your soul seems good. Give me your hand:
160	I'll privily away. I love the people,
161	But do not like to stage me to their eyes:
162	Through it do well, I do not relish well
163	Their loud applause and Aves vehement;
164	Nor do I think the man of safe discretion
165	That does affect it. Once more, fare you well.
166	
167	ANGELO	The heavens give safety to your purposes!
168	
169	ESCALUS	Lead forth and bring you back in happiness!
170	
171	DUKE	I thank you. Fare you well.
172	
173	[Exit]
174	
175	ESCALUS	I shall desire you, sir, to give me leave
176	To have free speech with you; and it concerns me
177	To look into the bottom of my place:
178	A power I have, but of what strength and nature
179	I am not yet instructed.
180	
181	ANGELO	'Tis so with me. Let us withdraw together,
182	And we may soon our satisfaction have
183	Touching that point.

202	
203	LUCIO	If the duke with the other dukes come not to
204	composition with the King of Hungary, why then all
205	the dukes fall upon the king.
206	
207	First Gentleman	Heaven grant us its peace, but not the King of
208	Hungary's!
209	
210	Second Gentleman	Amen.
211	
212	LUCIO	Thou concludest like the sanctimonious pirate, that
213	went to sea with the Ten Commandments, but scraped
214	one out of the table.
215	
216	Second Gentleman	'Thou shalt not steal'?
217	
218	LUCIO	Ay, that he razed.
219	
220	First Gentleman	Why, 'twas a commandment to command the captain and
221	all the rest from their functions: they put forth
222	to steal. There's not a soldier of us all, that, in
223	the thanksgiving before meat, do relish the petition
224	well that prays for peace.
225	
226	Second Gentleman	I never heard any soldier dislike it.
227	
228	LUCIO	I believe thee; for I think thou never wast where
229	grace was said.
230	
231	Second Gentleman	No? a dozen times at least.
232	
233	First Gentleman	What, in metre?
234	
235	LUCIO	In any proportion or in any language.
236	
237	First Gentleman	I think, or in any religion.
238	
239	LUCIO	Ay, why not? Grace is grace, despite of all
240	controversy: as, for example, thou thyself art a
241	wicked villain, despite of all grace.
242	
243	First Gentleman	Well, there went but a pair of shears between us.
244	
245	LUCIO	I grant; as there may between the lists and the
246	velvet. Thou art the list.
247	
248	First Gentleman	And thou the velvet: thou art good velvet; thou'rt
249	a three-piled piece, I warrant thee: I had as lief
250	be a list of an English kersey as be piled, as thou
251	art piled, for a French velvet. Do I speak
252	feelingly now?
253	
254	LUCIO	I think thou dost; and, indeed, with most painful
255	feeling of thy speech: I will, out of thine own
256	confession, learn to begin thy health; but, whilst I
257	live, forget to drink after thee.
258	
259	First Gentleman	I think I have done myself wrong, have I not?
260	
261	Second Gentleman	Yes, that thou hast, whether thou art tainted or free.
262	
263	LUCIO	Behold, behold. where Madam Mitigation comes! I
264	have purchased as many diseases under her roof as come to--
265	
266	Second Gentleman	To what, I pray?
267	
268	LUCIO	Judge.
269	
270	Second Gentleman	To three thousand dolours a year.
271	
272	First Gentleman	Ay, and more.
273	
274	LUCIO	A French crown more.
275	
276	First Gentleman	Thou art always figuring diseases in me; but thou
277	art full of error; I am sound.
278	
279	LUCIO	Nay, not as one would say, healthy; but so sound as
280	things that are hollow: thy bones are hollow;
281	impiety has made a feast of thee.
282	
283	[Enter MISTRESS OVERDONE]
284	
285	First Gentleman	How now! which of your hips has the most profound sciatica?
286	
287	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Well, well; there's one yonder arrested and carried
288	to prison was worth five thousand of you all.
289	
290	Second Gentleman	Who's that, I pray thee?
291	
292	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Marry, sir, that's Claudio, Signior Claudio.
293	
294	First Gentleman	Claudio to prison? 'tis not so.
295	
296	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Nay, but I know 'tis so: I saw him arrested, saw
297	him carried away; and, which is more, within these
298	three days his head to be chopped off.
299	
300	LUCIO	But, after all this fooling, I would not have it so.
301	Art thou sure of this?
302	
303	MISTRESS OVERDONE	I am too sure of it: and it is for getting Madam
304	Julietta with child.
305	
306	LUCIO	Believe me, this may be: he promised to meet me two
307	hours since, and he was ever precise in
308	promise-keeping.
309	
310	Second Gentleman	Besides, you know, it draws something near to the
311	speech we had to such a purpose.
312	
313	First Gentleman	But, most of all, agreeing with the proclamation.
314	
315	LUCIO	Away! let's go learn the truth of it.
316	
317	[Exeunt LUCIO and Gentlemen]
318	
319	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Thus, what with the war, what with the sweat, what
320	with the gallows and what with poverty, I am
321	custom-shrunk.
322	
323	[Enter POMPEY]
324	
325	How now! what's the news with you?
326	
327	POMPEY	Yonder man is carried to prison.
328	
329	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Well; what has he done?
330	
331	POMPEY	A woman.
332	
333	MISTRESS OVERDONE	But what's his offence?
334	
335	POMPEY	Groping for trouts in a peculiar river.
336	
337	MISTRESS OVERDONE	What, is there a maid with child by him?
338	
339	POMPEY	No, but there's a woman with maid by him. You have
340	not heard of the proclamation, have you?
341	
342	MISTRESS OVERDONE	What proclamation, man?
343	
344	POMPEY	All houses in the suburbs of Vienna must be plucked down.
345	
346	MISTRESS OVERDONE	And what shall become of those in the city?
347	
348	POMPEY	They shall stand for seed: they had gone down too,
349	but that a wise burgher put in for them.
350	
351	MISTRESS OVERDONE	But shall all our houses of resort in the suburbs be
352	pulled down?
353	
354	POMPEY	To the ground, mistress.
355	
356	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Why, here's a change indeed in the commonwealth!
357	What shall become of me?
358	
359	POMPEY	Come; fear you not: good counsellors lack no
360	clients: though you change your place, you need not
361	change your trade; I'll be your tapster still.
362	Courage! there will be pity taken on you: you that
363	have worn your eyes almost out in the service, you
364	will be considered.
365	
366	MISTRESS OVERDONE	What's to do here, Thomas tapster? let's withdraw.
367	
368	POMPEY	Here comes Signior Claudio, led by the provost to
369	prison; and there's Madam Juliet.
370	
371	[Exeunt]
372	
373	[Enter Provost, CLAUDIO, JULIET, and Officers]
374	
375	CLAUDIO	Fellow, why dost thou show me thus to the world?
376	Bear me to prison, where I am committed.
377	
378	Provost	I do it not in evil disposition,
379	But from Lord Angelo by special charge.
380	
381	CLAUDIO	Thus can the demigod Authority
382	Make us pay down for our offence by weight
383	The words of heaven; on whom it will, it will;
384	On whom it will not, so; yet still 'tis just.
385	
386	[Re-enter LUCIO and two Gentlemen]
387	
388	LUCIO	Why, how now, Claudio! whence comes this restraint?
389	
390	CLAUDIO	From too much liberty, my Lucio, liberty:
391	As surfeit is the father of much fast,
392	So every scope by the immoderate use
393	Turns to restraint. Our natures do pursue,
394	Like rats that ravin down their proper bane,
395	A thirsty evil; and when we drink we die.
396	
397	LUCIO	If could speak so wisely under an arrest, I would
398	send for certain of my creditors: and yet, to say
399	the truth, I had as lief have the foppery of freedom
400	as the morality of imprisonment. What's thy
401	offence, Claudio?
402	
403	CLAUDIO	What but to speak of would offend again.
404	
405	LUCIO	What, is't murder?
406	
407	CLAUDIO	No.
408	
409	LUCIO	Lechery?
410	
411	CLAUDIO	Call it so.
412	
413	Provost	Away, sir! you must go.
414	
415	CLAUDIO	One word, good friend. Lucio, a word with you.
416	
417	LUCIO	A hundred, if they'll do you any good.
418	Is lechery so look'd after?
419	
420	CLAUDIO	Thus stands it with me: upon a true contract
421	I got possession of Julietta's bed:
422	You know the lady; she is fast my wife,
423	Save that we do the denunciation lack
424	Of outward order: this we came not to,
425	Only for propagation of a dower
426	Remaining in the coffer of her friends,
427	From whom we thought it meet to hide our love
428	Till time had made them for us. But it chances
429	The stealth of our most mutual entertainment
430	With character too gross is writ on Juliet.
431	
432	LUCIO	With child, perhaps?
433	
434	CLAUDIO	Unhappily, even so.
435	And the new deputy now for the duke--
436	Whether it be the fault and glimpse of newness,
437	Or whether that the body public be
438	A horse whereon the governor doth ride,
439	Who, newly in the seat, that it may know
440	He can command, lets it straight feel the spur;
441	Whether the tyranny be in his place,
442	Or in his emmence that fills it up,
443	I stagger in:--but this new governor
444	Awakes me all the enrolled penalties
445	Which have, like unscour'd armour, hung by the wall
446	So long that nineteen zodiacs have gone round
447	And none of them been worn; and, for a name,
448	Now puts the drowsy and neglected act
449	Freshly on me: 'tis surely for a name.
450	
451	LUCIO	I warrant it is: and thy head stands so tickle on
452	thy shoulders that a milkmaid, if she be in love,
453	may sigh it off. Send after the duke and appeal to
454	him.
455	
456	CLAUDIO	I have done so, but he's not to be found.
457	I prithee, Lucio, do me this kind service:
458	This day my sister should the cloister enter
459	And there receive her approbation:
460	Acquaint her with the danger of my state:
461	Implore her, in my voice, that she make friends
462	To the strict deputy; bid herself assay him:
463	I have great hope in that; for in her youth
464	There is a prone and speechless dialect,
465	Such as move men; beside, she hath prosperous art
466	When she will play with reason and discourse,
467	And well she can persuade.
468	
469	LUCIO	I pray she may; as well for the encouragement of the
470	like, which else would stand under grievous
471	imposition, as for the enjoying of thy life, who I
472	would be sorry should be thus foolishly lost at a
473	game of tick-tack. I'll to her.
474	
475	CLAUDIO	I thank you, good friend Lucio.

495	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO and FRIAR THOMAS]
496	
497	DUKE VINCENTIO	No, holy father; throw away that thought;
498	Believe not that the dribbling dart of love
499	Can pierce a complete bosom. Why I desire thee
500	To give me secret harbour, hath a purpose
501	More grave and wrinkled than the aims and ends
502	Of burning youth.
503	
504	FRIAR THOMAS	                  May your grace speak of it?
505	
506	DUKE VINCENTIO	My holy sir, none better knows than you
507	How I have ever loved the life removed
508	And held in idle price to haunt assemblies
509	Where youth, and cost, and witless bravery keeps.
510	I have deliver'd to Lord Angelo,
511	A man of stricture and firm abstinence,
512	My absolute power and place here in Vienna,
513	And he supposes me travell'd to Poland;
514	For so I have strew'd it in the common ear,
515	And so it is received. Now, pious sir,
516	You will demand of me why I do this?
517	
518	FRIAR THOMAS	Gladly, my lord.
519	
520	DUKE VINCENTIO	We have strict statutes and most biting laws.
521	The needful bits and curbs to headstrong weeds,
522	Which for this nineteen years we have let slip;
523	Even like an o'ergrown lion in a cave,
524	That goes not out to prey. Now, as fond fathers,
525	Having bound up the threatening twigs of birch,
526	Only to stick it in their children's sight
527	For terror, not to use, in time the rod
528	Becomes more mock'd than fear'd; so our decrees,
529	Dead to infliction, to themselves are dead;
530	And liberty plucks justice by the nose;
531	The baby beats the nurse, and quite athwart
532	Goes all decorum.
533	
534	FRIAR THOMAS	                  It rested in your grace
535	To unloose this tied-up justice when you pleased:
536	And it in you more dreadful would have seem'd
537	Than in Lord Angelo.
538	
539	DUKE VINCENTIO	I do fear, too dreadful:
540	Sith 'twas my fault to give the people scope,
541	'Twould be my tyranny to strike and gall them
542	For what I bid them do: for we bid this be done,
543	When evil deeds have their permissive pass
544	And not the punishment. Therefore indeed, my father,
545	I have on Angelo imposed the office;
546	Who may, in the ambush of my name, strike home,
547	And yet my nature never in the fight
548	To do in slander. And to behold his sway,
549	I will, as 'twere a brother of your order,
550	Visit both prince and people: therefore, I prithee,
551	Supply me with the habit and instruct me
552	How I may formally in person bear me
553	Like a true friar. More reasons for this action
554	At our more leisure shall I render you;
555	Only, this one: Lord Angelo is precise;
556	Stands at a guard with envy; scarce confesses
557	That his blood flows, or that his appetite
558	Is more to bread than stone: hence shall we see,
559	If power change purpose, what our seemers be.

596	He calls again; I pray you, answer him.
597	
598	[Exit]
599	
600	ISABELLA	Peace and prosperity! Who is't that calls
601	
602	[Enter LUCIO]
603	
604	LUCIO	Hail, virgin, if you be, as those cheek-roses
605	Proclaim you are no less! Can you so stead me
606	As bring me to the sight of Isabella,
607	A novice of this place and the fair sister
608	To her unhappy brother Claudio?
609	
610	ISABELLA	Why 'her unhappy brother'? let me ask,
611	The rather for I now must make you know
612	I am that Isabella and his sister.
613	
614	LUCIO	Gentle and fair, your brother kindly greets you:
615	Not to be weary with you, he's in prison.
616	
617	ISABELLA	Woe me! for what?
618	
619	LUCIO	For that which, if myself might be his judge,
620	He should receive his punishment in thanks:
621	He hath got his friend with child.
622	
623	ISABELLA	Sir, make me not your story.
624	
625	LUCIO	It is true.
626	I would not--though 'tis my familiar sin
627	With maids to seem the lapwing and to jest,
628	Tongue far from heart--play with all virgins so:
629	I hold you as a thing ensky'd and sainted.
630	By your renouncement an immortal spirit,
631	And to be talk'd with in sincerity,
632	As with a saint.
633	
634	ISABELLA	You do blaspheme the good in mocking me.
635	
636	LUCIO	Do not believe it. Fewness and truth, 'tis thus:
637	Your brother and his lover have embraced:
638	As those that feed grow full, as blossoming time
639	That from the seedness the bare fallow brings
640	To teeming foison, even so her plenteous womb
641	Expresseth his full tilth and husbandry.
642	
643	ISABELLA	Some one with child by him? My cousin Juliet?
644	
645	LUCIO	Is she your cousin?
646	
647	ISABELLA	Adoptedly; as school-maids change their names
648	By vain though apt affection.
649	
650	LUCIO	She it is.
651	
652	ISABELLA	O, let him marry her.
653	
654	LUCIO	This is the point.
655	The duke is very strangely gone from hence;
656	Bore many gentlemen, myself being one,
657	In hand and hope of action: but we do learn
658	By those that know the very nerves of state,
659	His givings-out were of an infinite distance
660	From his true-meant design. Upon his place,
661	And with full line of his authority,
662	Governs Lord Angelo; a man whose blood
663	Is very snow-broth; one who never feels
664	The wanton stings and motions of the sense,
665	But doth rebate and blunt his natural edge
666	With profits of the mind, study and fast.
667	He--to give fear to use and liberty,
668	Which have for long run by the hideous law,
669	As mice by lions--hath pick'd out an act,
670	Under whose heavy sense your brother's life
671	Falls into forfeit: he arrests him on it;
672	And follows close the rigour of the statute,
673	To make him an example. All hope is gone,
674	Unless you have the grace by your fair prayer
675	To soften Angelo: and that's my pith of business
676	'Twixt you and your poor brother.
677	
678	ISABELLA	Doth he so seek his life?
679	
680	LUCIO	Has censured him
681	Already; and, as I hear, the provost hath
682	A warrant for his execution.
683	
684	ISABELLA	Alas! what poor ability's in me
685	To do him good?
686	
687	LUCIO	                  Assay the power you have.
688	
689	ISABELLA	My power? Alas, I doubt--
690	
691	LUCIO	Our doubts are traitors
692	And make us lose the good we oft might win
693	By fearing to attempt. Go to Lord Angelo,
694	And let him learn to know, when maidens sue,
695	Men give like gods; but when they weep and kneel,
696	All their petitions are as freely theirs
697	As they themselves would owe them.
698	
699	ISABELLA	I'll see what I can do.
700	
701	LUCIO	But speedily.
702	
703	ISABELLA	I will about it straight;
704	No longer staying but to give the mother
705	Notice of my affair. I humbly thank you:
706	Commend me to my brother: soon at night
707	I'll send him certain word of my success.
708	
709	LUCIO	I take my leave of you.
710	
711	ISABELLA	Good sir, adieu.
712	
713	[Exeunt]

721	ACT II
722	
723	
724	SCENE I	A hall In ANGELO's house.
725	
726	
727	[Enter ANGELO, ESCALUS, and a Justice, Provost,
728	Officers, and other Attendants, behind]
729	
730	ANGELO	We must not make a scarecrow of the law,
731	Setting it up to fear the birds of prey,
732	And let it keep one shape, till custom make it
733	Their perch and not their terror.
734	
735	ESCALUS	Ay, but yet
736	Let us be keen, and rather cut a little,
737	Than fall, and bruise to death. Alas, this gentleman
738	Whom I would save, had a most noble father!
739	Let but your honour know,
740	Whom I believe to be most strait in virtue,
741	That, in the working of your own affections,
742	Had time cohered with place or place with wishing,
743	Or that the resolute acting of your blood
744	Could have attain'd the effect of your own purpose,
745	Whether you had not sometime in your life
746	Err'd in this point which now you censure him,
747	And pull'd the law upon you.
748	
749	ANGELO	'Tis one thing to be tempted, Escalus,
750	Another thing to fall. I not deny,
751	The jury, passing on the prisoner's life,
752	May in the sworn twelve have a thief or two
753	Guiltier than him they try. What's open made to justice,
754	That justice seizes: what know the laws
755	That thieves do pass on thieves? 'Tis very pregnant,
756	The jewel that we find, we stoop and take't
757	Because we see it; but what we do not see
758	We tread upon, and never think of it.
759	You may not so extenuate his offence
760	For I have had such faults; but rather tell me,
761	When I, that censure him, do so offend,
762	Let mine own judgment pattern out my death,
763	And nothing come in partial. Sir, he must die.
764	
765	ESCALUS	Be it as your wisdom will.
766	
767	ANGELO	Where is the provost?
768	
769	Provost	Here, if it like your honour.
770	
771	ANGELO	See that Claudio
772	Be executed by nine to-morrow morning:
773	Bring him his confessor, let him be prepared;
774	For that's the utmost of his pilgrimage.
775	
776	[Exit Provost]
777	
778	ESCALUS	[Aside]  Well, heaven forgive him! and forgive us all!
779	Some rise by sin, and some by virtue fall:
780	Some run from brakes of ice, and answer none:
781	And some condemned for a fault alone.
782	
783	[Enter ELBOW, and Officers with FROTH and POMPEY]
784	
785	ELBOW	Come, bring them away: if these be good people in
786	a commonweal that do nothing but use their abuses in
787	common houses, I know no law: bring them away.
788	
789	ANGELO	How now, sir! What's your name? and what's the matter?
790	
791	ELBOW	If it Please your honour, I am the poor duke's
792	constable, and my name is Elbow: I do lean upon
793	justice, sir, and do bring in here before your good
794	honour two notorious benefactors.
795	
796	ANGELO	Benefactors? Well; what benefactors are they? are
797	they not malefactors?
798	
799	ELBOW	If it? please your honour, I know not well what they
800	are: but precise villains they are, that I am sure
801	of; and void of all profanation in the world that
802	good Christians ought to have.
803	
804	ESCALUS	This comes off well; here's a wise officer.
805	
806	ANGELO	Go to: what quality are they of? Elbow is your
807	name? why dost thou not speak, Elbow?
808	
809	POMPEY	He cannot, sir; he's out at elbow.
810	
811	ANGELO	What are you, sir?
812	
813	ELBOW	He, sir! a tapster, sir; parcel-bawd; one that
814	serves a bad woman; whose house, sir, was, as they
815	say, plucked down in the suburbs; and now she
816	professes a hot-house, which, I think, is a very ill house too.
817	
818	ESCALUS	How know you that?
819	
820	ELBOW	My wife, sir, whom I detest before heaven and your honour,--
821	
822	ESCALUS	How? thy wife?
823	
824	ELBOW	Ay, sir; whom, I thank heaven, is an honest woman,--
825	
826	ESCALUS	Dost thou detest her therefore?
827	
828	ELBOW	I say, sir, I will detest myself also, as well as
829	she, that this house, if it be not a bawd's house,
830	it is pity of her life, for it is a naughty house.
831	
832	ESCALUS	How dost thou know that, constable?
833	
834	ELBOW	Marry, sir, by my wife; who, if she had been a woman
835	cardinally given, might have been accused in
836	fornication, adultery, and all uncleanliness there.
837	
838	ESCALUS	By the woman's means?
839	
840	ELBOW	Ay, sir, by Mistress Overdone's means: but as she
841	spit in his face, so she defied him.
842	
843	POMPEY	Sir, if it please your honour, this is not so.
844	
845	ELBOW	Prove it before these varlets here, thou honourable
846	man; prove it.
847	
848	ESCALUS	Do you hear how he misplaces?
849	
850	POMPEY	Sir, she came in great with child; and longing,
851	saving your honour's reverence, for stewed prunes;
852	sir, we had but two in the house, which at that very
853	distant time stood, as it were, in a fruit-dish, a
854	dish of some three-pence; your honours have seen
855	such dishes; they are not China dishes, but very
856	good dishes,--
857	
858	ESCALUS	Go to, go to: no matter for the dish, sir.
859	
860	POMPEY	No, indeed, sir, not of a pin; you are therein in
861	the right: but to the point. As I say, this
862	Mistress Elbow, being, as I say, with child, and
863	being great-bellied, and longing, as I said, for
864	prunes; and having but two in the dish, as I said,
865	Master Froth here, this very man, having eaten the
866	rest, as I said, and, as I say, paying for them very
867	honestly; for, as you know, Master Froth, I could
868	not give you three-pence again.
869	
870	FROTH	No, indeed.
871	
872	POMPEY	Very well: you being then, if you be remembered,
873	cracking the stones of the foresaid prunes,--
874	
875	FROTH	Ay, so I did indeed.
876	
877	POMPEY	Why, very well; I telling you then, if you be
878	remembered, that such a one and such a one were past
879	cure of the thing you wot of, unless they kept very
880	good diet, as I told you,--
881	
882	FROTH	All this is true.
883	
884	POMPEY	Why, very well, then,--
885	
886	ESCALUS	Come, you are a tedious fool: to the purpose. What
887	was done to Elbow's wife, that he hath cause to
888	complain of? Come me to what was done to her.
889	
890	POMPEY	Sir, your honour cannot come to that yet.
891	
892	ESCALUS	No, sir, nor I mean it not.
893	
894	POMPEY	Sir, but you shall come to it, by your honour's
895	leave. And, I beseech you, look into Master Froth
896	here, sir; a man of four-score pound a year; whose
897	father died at Hallowmas: was't not at Hallowmas,
898	Master Froth?
899	
900	FROTH	All-hallond eve.
901	
902	POMPEY	Why, very well; I hope here be truths. He, sir,
903	sitting, as I say, in a lower chair, sir; 'twas in
904	the Bunch of Grapes, where indeed you have a delight
905	to sit, have you not?
906	
907	FROTH	I have so; because it is an open room and good for winter.
908	
909	POMPEY	Why, very well, then; I hope here be truths.
910	
911	ANGELO	This will last out a night in Russia,
912	When nights are longest there: I'll take my leave.
913	And leave you to the hearing of the cause;
914	Hoping you'll find good cause to whip them all.
915	
916	ESCALUS	I think no less. Good morrow to your lordship.
917	
918	[Exit ANGELO]
919	
920	Now, sir, come on: what was done to Elbow's wife, once more?
921	
922	POMPEY	Once, sir? there was nothing done to her once.
923	
924	ELBOW	I beseech you, sir, ask him what this man did to my wife.
925	
926	POMPEY	I beseech your honour, ask me.
927	
928	ESCALUS	Well, sir; what did this gentleman to her?
929	
930	POMPEY	I beseech you, sir, look in this gentleman's face.
931	Good Master Froth, look upon his honour; 'tis for a
932	good purpose. Doth your honour mark his face?
933	
934	ESCALUS	Ay, sir, very well.
935	
936	POMPEY	Nay; I beseech you, mark it well.
937	
938	ESCALUS	Well, I do so.
939	
940	POMPEY	Doth your honour see any harm in his face?
941	
942	ESCALUS	Why, no.
943	
944	POMPEY	I'll be supposed upon a book, his face is the worst
945	thing about him. Good, then; if his face be the
946	worst thing about him, how could Master Froth do the
947	constable's wife any harm? I would know that of
948	your honour.
949	
950	ESCALUS	He's in the right. Constable, what say you to it?
951	
952	ELBOW	First, an it like you, the house is a respected
953	house; next, this is a respected fellow; and his
954	mistress is a respected woman.
955	
956	POMPEY	By this hand, sir, his wife is a more respected
957	person than any of us all.
958	
959	ELBOW	Varlet, thou liest; thou liest, wicked varlet! the
960	time has yet to come that she was ever respected
961	with man, woman, or child.
962	
963	POMPEY	Sir, she was respected with him before he married with her.
964	
965	ESCALUS	Which is the wiser here? Justice or Iniquity? Is
966	this true?
967	
968	ELBOW	O thou caitiff! O thou varlet! O thou wicked
969	Hannibal! I respected with her before I was married
970	to her! If ever I was respected with her, or she
971	with me, let not your worship think me the poor
972	duke's officer. Prove this, thou wicked Hannibal, or
973	I'll have mine action of battery on thee.
974	
975	ESCALUS	If he took you a box o' the ear, you might have your
976	action of slander too.
977	
978	ELBOW	Marry, I thank your good worship for it. What is't
979	your worship's pleasure I shall do with this wicked caitiff?
980	
981	ESCALUS	Truly, officer, because he hath some offences in him
982	that thou wouldst discover if thou couldst, let him
983	continue in his courses till thou knowest what they
984	are.
985	
986	ELBOW	Marry, I thank your worship for it. Thou seest, thou
987	wicked varlet, now, what's come upon thee: thou art
988	to continue now, thou varlet; thou art to continue.
989	
990	ESCALUS	Where were you born, friend?
991	
992	FROTH	Here in Vienna, sir.
993	
994	ESCALUS	Are you of fourscore pounds a year?
995	
996	FROTH	Yes, an't please you, sir.
997	
998	ESCALUS	So. What trade are you of, sir?
999	
1000	POMPHEY	Tapster; a poor widow's tapster.
1001	
1002	ESCALUS	Your mistress' name?
1003	
1004	POMPHEY	Mistress Overdone.
1005	
1006	ESCALUS	Hath she had any more than one husband?
1007	
1008	POMPEY	Nine, sir; Overdone by the last.
1009	
1010	ESCALUS	Nine! Come hither to me, Master Froth. Master
1011	Froth, I would not have you acquainted with
1012	tapsters: they will draw you, Master Froth, and you
1013	will hang them. Get you gone, and let me hear no
1014	more of you.
1015	
1016	FROTH	I thank your worship. For mine own part, I never
1017	come into any room in a tap-house, but I am drawn
1018	in.
1019	
1020	ESCALUS	Well, no more of it, Master Froth: farewell.
1021	
1022	[Exit FROTH]
1023	
1024	Come you hither to me, Master tapster. What's your
1025	name, Master tapster?
1026	
1027	POMPEY	Pompey.
1028	
1029	ESCALUS	What else?
1030	
1031	POMPEY	Bum, sir.
1032	
1033	ESCALUS	Troth, and your bum is the greatest thing about you;
1034	so that in the beastliest sense you are Pompey the
1035	Great. Pompey, you are partly a bawd, Pompey,
1036	howsoever you colour it in being a tapster, are you
1037	not? come, tell me true: it shall be the better for you.
1038	
1039	POMPEY	Truly, sir, I am a poor fellow that would live.
1040	
1041	ESCALUS	How would you live, Pompey? by being a bawd? What
1042	do you think of the trade, Pompey? is it a lawful trade?
1043	
1044	POMPEY	If the law would allow it, sir.
1045	
1046	ESCALUS	But the law will not allow it, Pompey; nor it shall
1047	not be allowed in Vienna.
1048	
1049	POMPEY	Does your worship mean to geld and splay all the
1050	youth of the city?
1051	
1052	ESCALUS	No, Pompey.
1053	
1054	POMPEY	Truly, sir, in my poor opinion, they will to't then.
1055	If your worship will take order for the drabs and
1056	the knaves, you need not to fear the bawds.
1057	
1058	ESCALUS	There are pretty orders beginning, I can tell you:
1059	it is but heading and hanging.
1060	
1061	POMPEY	If you head and hang all that offend that way but
1062	for ten year together, you'll be glad to give out a
1063	commission for more heads: if this law hold in
1064	Vienna ten year, I'll rent the fairest house in it
1065	after three-pence a bay: if you live to see this
1066	come to pass, say Pompey told you so.
1067	
1068	ESCALUS	Thank you, good Pompey; and, in requital of your
1069	prophecy, hark you: I advise you, let me not find
1070	you before me again upon any complaint whatsoever;
1071	no, not for dwelling where you do: if I do, Pompey,
1072	I shall beat you to your tent, and prove a shrewd
1073	Caesar to you; in plain dealing, Pompey, I shall
1074	have you whipt: so, for this time, Pompey, fare you well.
1075	
1076	POMPEY	I thank your worship for your good counsel:
1077	
1078	[Aside]
1079	
1080	but I shall follow it as the flesh and fortune shall
1081	better determine.
1082	Whip me? No, no; let carman whip his jade:
1083	The valiant heart is not whipt out of his trade.
1084	
1085	[Exit]
1086	
1087	ESCALUS	Come hither to me, Master Elbow; come hither, Master
1088	constable. How long have you been in this place of constable?
1089	
1090	ELBOW	Seven year and a half, sir.
1091	
1092	ESCALUS	I thought, by your readiness in the office, you had
1093	continued in it some time. You say, seven years together?
1094	
1095	ELBOW	And a half, sir.
1096	
1097	ESCALUS	Alas, it hath been great pains to you. They do you
1098	wrong to put you so oft upon 't: are there not men
1099	in your ward sufficient to serve it?
1100	
1101	ELBOW	Faith, sir, few of any wit in such matters: as they
1102	are chosen, they are glad to choose me for them; I
1103	do it for some piece of money, and go through with
1104	all.
1105	
1106	ESCALUS	Look you bring me in the names of some six or seven,
1107	the most sufficient of your parish.
1108	
1109	ELBOW	To your worship's house, sir?
1110	
1111	ESCALUS	To my house. Fare you well.
1112	
1113	[Exit ELBOW]
1114	
1115	What's o'clock, think you?
1116	
1117	Justice	Eleven, sir.
1118	
1119	ESCALUS	I pray you home to dinner with me.
1120	
1121	Justice	I humbly thank you.
1122	
1123	ESCALUS	It grieves me for the death of Claudio;
1124	But there's no remedy.
1125	
1126	Justice	Lord Angelo is severe.
1127	
1128	ESCALUS	It is but needful:
1129	Mercy is not itself, that oft looks so;
1130	Pardon is still the nurse of second woe:
1131	But yet,--poor Claudio! There is no remedy.
1132	Come, sir.

1145	SCENE II	Another room in the same.
1146	
1147	
1148	[Enter Provost and a Servant]
1149	
1150	Servant	He's hearing of a cause; he will come straight
1151	I'll tell him of you.
1152	
1153	Provost	Pray you, do.
1154	
1155	[Exit Servant]
1156	
1157	I'll know
1158	His pleasure; may be he will relent. Alas,
1159	He hath but as offended in a dream!
1160	All sects, all ages smack of this vice; and he
1161	To die for't!
1162	
1163	[Enter ANGELO]
1164	
1165	ANGELO	                  Now, what's the matter. Provost?
1166	
1167	Provost	Is it your will Claudio shall die tomorrow?
1168	
1169	ANGELO	Did not I tell thee yea? hadst thou not order?
1170	Why dost thou ask again?
1171	
1172	Provost	Lest I might be too rash:
1173	Under your good correction, I have seen,
1174	When, after execution, judgment hath
1175	Repented o'er his doom.
1176	
1177	ANGELO	Go to; let that be mine:
1178	Do you your office, or give up your place,
1179	And you shall well be spared.
1180	
1181	Provost	I crave your honour's pardon.
1182	What shall be done, sir, with the groaning Juliet?
1183	She's very near her hour.
1184	
1185	ANGELO	Dispose of her
1186	To some more fitter place, and that with speed.
1187	
1188	[Re-enter Servant]
1189	
1190	Servant	Here is the sister of the man condemn'd
1191	Desires access to you.
1192	
1193	ANGELO	Hath he a sister?
1194	
1195	Provost	Ay, my good lord; a very virtuous maid,
1196	And to be shortly of a sisterhood,
1197	If not already.
1198	
1199	ANGELO	                  Well, let her be admitted.
1200	
1201	[Exit Servant]
1202	
1203	See you the fornicatress be removed:
1204	Let have needful, but not lavish, means;
1205	There shall be order for't.
1206	
1207	[Enter ISABELLA and LUCIO]
1208	
1209	Provost	God save your honour!
1210	
1211	ANGELO	Stay a little while.
1212	
1213	[To ISABELLA]
1214	
1215	You're welcome: what's your will?
1216	
1217	ISABELLA	I am a woeful suitor to your honour,
1218	Please but your honour hear me.
1219	
1220	ANGELO	Well; what's your suit?
1221	
1222	ISABELLA	There is a vice that most I do abhor,
1223	And most desire should meet the blow of justice;
1224	For which I would not plead, but that I must;
1225	For which I must not plead, but that I am
1226	At war 'twixt will and will not.
1227	
1228	ANGELO	Well; the matter?
1229	
1230	ISABELLA	I have a brother is condemn'd to die:
1231	I do beseech you, let it be his fault,
1232	And not my brother.
1233	
1234	Provost	[Aside]  Heaven give thee moving graces!
1235	
1236	ANGELO	Condemn the fault and not the actor of it?
1237	Why, every fault's condemn'd ere it be done:
1238	Mine were the very cipher of a function,
1239	To fine the faults whose fine stands in record,
1240	And let go by the actor.
1241	
1242	ISABELLA	O just but severe law!
1243	I had a brother, then. Heaven keep your honour!
1244	
1245	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  Give't not o'er so: to him
1246	again, entreat him;
1247	Kneel down before him, hang upon his gown:
1248	You are too cold; if you should need a pin,
1249	You could not with more tame a tongue desire it:
1250	To him, I say!
1251	
1252	ISABELLA	Must he needs die?
1253	
1254	ANGELO	                  Maiden, no remedy.
1255	
1256	ISABELLA	Yes; I do think that you might pardon him,
1257	And neither heaven nor man grieve at the mercy.
1258	
1259	ANGELO	I will not do't.
1260	
1261	ISABELLA	                  But can you, if you would?
1262	
1263	ANGELO	Look, what I will not, that I cannot do.
1264	
1265	ISABELLA	But might you do't, and do the world no wrong,
1266	If so your heart were touch'd with that remorse
1267	As mine is to him?
1268	
1269	ANGELO	                  He's sentenced; 'tis too late.
1270	
1271	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  You are too cold.
1272	
1273	ISABELLA	Too late? why, no; I, that do speak a word.
1274	May call it back again. Well, believe this,
1275	No ceremony that to great ones 'longs,
1276	Not the king's crown, nor the deputed sword,
1277	The marshal's truncheon, nor the judge's robe,
1278	Become them with one half so good a grace
1279	As mercy does.
1280	If he had been as you and you as he,
1281	You would have slipt like him; but he, like you,
1282	Would not have been so stern.
1283	
1284	ANGELO	Pray you, be gone.
1285	
1286	ISABELLA	I would to heaven I had your potency,
1287	And you were Isabel! should it then be thus?
1288	No; I would tell what 'twere to be a judge,
1289	And what a prisoner.
1290	
1291	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]
1292	
1293	Ay, touch him; there's the vein.
1294	
1295	ANGELO	Your brother is a forfeit of the law,
1296	And you but waste your words.
1297	
1298	ISABELLA	Alas, alas!
1299	Why, all the souls that were were forfeit once;
1300	And He that might the vantage best have took
1301	Found out the remedy. How would you be,
1302	If He, which is the top of judgment, should
1303	But judge you as you are? O, think on that;
1304	And mercy then will breathe within your lips,
1305	Like man new made.
1306	
1307	ANGELO	                  Be you content, fair maid;
1308	It is the law, not I condemn your brother:
1309	Were he my kinsman, brother, or my son,
1310	It should be thus with him: he must die tomorrow.
1311	
1312	ISABELLA	To-morrow! O, that's sudden! Spare him, spare him!
1313	He's not prepared for death. Even for our kitchens
1314	We kill the fowl of season: shall we serve heaven
1315	With less respect than we do minister
1316	To our gross selves? Good, good my lord, bethink you;
1317	Who is it that hath died for this offence?
1318	There's many have committed it.
1319	
1320	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]           Ay, well said.
1321	
1322	ANGELO	The law hath not been dead, though it hath slept:
1323	Those many had not dared to do that evil,
1324	If the first that did the edict infringe
1325	Had answer'd for his deed: now 'tis awake
1326	Takes note of what is done; and, like a prophet,
1327	Looks in a glass, that shows what future evils,
1328	Either new, or by remissness new-conceived,
1329	And so in progress to be hatch'd and born,
1330	Are now to have no successive degrees,
1331	But, ere they live, to end.
1332	
1333	ISABELLA	Yet show some pity.
1334	
1335	ANGELO	I show it most of all when I show justice;
1336	For then I pity those I do not know,
1337	Which a dismiss'd offence would after gall;
1338	And do him right that, answering one foul wrong,
1339	Lives not to act another. Be satisfied;
1340	Your brother dies to-morrow; be content.
1341	
1342	ISABELLA	So you must be the first that gives this sentence,
1343	And he, that suffer's. O, it is excellent
1344	To have a giant's strength; but it is tyrannous
1345	To use it like a giant.
1346	
1347	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]   That's well said.
1348	
1349	ISABELLA	Could great men thunder
1350	As Jove himself does, Jove would ne'er be quiet,
1351	For every pelting, petty officer
1352	Would use his heaven for thunder;
1353	Nothing but thunder! Merciful Heaven,
1354	Thou rather with thy sharp and sulphurous bolt
1355	Split'st the unwedgeable and gnarled oak
1356	Than the soft myrtle: but man, proud man,
1357	Drest in a little brief authority,
1358	Most ignorant of what he's most assured,
1359	His glassy essence, like an angry ape,
1360	Plays such fantastic tricks before high heaven
1361	As make the angels weep; who, with our spleens,
1362	Would all themselves laugh mortal.
1363	
1364	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  O, to him, to him, wench! he
1365	will relent;
1366	He's coming; I perceive 't.
1367	
1368	Provost	[Aside]  Pray heaven she win him!
1369	
1370	ISABELLA	We cannot weigh our brother with ourself:
1371	Great men may jest with saints; 'tis wit in them,
1372	But in the less foul profanation.
1373	
1374	LUCIO	Thou'rt i' the right, girl; more o, that.
1375	
1376	ISABELLA	That in the captain's but a choleric word,
1377	Which in the soldier is flat blasphemy.
1378	
1379	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  Art avised o' that? more on 't.
1380	
1381	ANGELO	Why do you put these sayings upon me?
1382	
1383	ISABELLA	Because authority, though it err like others,
1384	Hath yet a kind of medicine in itself,
1385	That skins the vice o' the top. Go to your bosom;
1386	Knock there, and ask your heart what it doth know
1387	That's like my brother's fault: if it confess
1388	A natural guiltiness such as is his,
1389	Let it not sound a thought upon your tongue
1390	Against my brother's life.
1391	
1392	ANGELO	[Aside]                  She speaks, and 'tis
1393	Such sense, that my sense breeds with it. Fare you well.
1394	
1395	ISABELLA	Gentle my lord, turn back.
1396	
1397	ANGELO	I will bethink me: come again tomorrow.
1398	
1399	ISABELLA	Hark how I'll bribe you: good my lord, turn back.
1400	
1401	ANGELO	How! bribe me?
1402	
1403	ISABELLA	Ay, with such gifts that heaven shall share with you.
1404	
1405	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  You had marr'd all else.
1406	
1407	ISABELLA	Not with fond shekels of the tested gold,
1408	Or stones whose rates are either rich or poor
1409	As fancy values them; but with true prayers
1410	That shall be up at heaven and enter there
1411	Ere sun-rise, prayers from preserved souls,
1412	From fasting maids whose minds are dedicate
1413	To nothing temporal.
1414	
1415	ANGELO	Well; come to me to-morrow.
1416	
1417	LUCIO	[Aside to ISABELLA]  Go to; 'tis well; away!
1418	
1419	ISABELLA	Heaven keep your honour safe!
1420	
1421	ANGELO	[Aside]	Amen:
1422	For I am that way going to temptation,
1423	Where prayers cross.
1424	
1425	ISABELLA	At what hour to-morrow
1426	Shall I attend your lordship?
1427	
1428	ANGELO	At any time 'fore noon.
1429	
1430	ISABELLA	'Save your honour!
1431	
1432	[Exeunt ISABELLA, LUCIO, and Provost]
1433	
1434	ANGELO	                  From thee, even from thy virtue!
1435	What's this, what's this? Is this her fault or mine?
1436	The tempter or the tempted, who sins most?
1437	Ha!
1438	Not she: nor doth she tempt: but it is I
1439	That, lying by the violet in the sun,
1440	Do as the carrion does, not as the flower,
1441	Corrupt with virtuous season. Can it be
1442	That modesty may more betray our sense
1443	Than woman's lightness? Having waste ground enough,
1444	Shall we desire to raze the sanctuary
1445	And pitch our evils there? O, fie, fie, fie!
1446	What dost thou, or what art thou, Angelo?
1447	Dost thou desire her foully for those things
1448	That make her good? O, let her brother live!
1449	Thieves for their robbery have authority
1450	When judges steal themselves. What, do I love her,
1451	That I desire to hear her speak again,
1452	And feast upon her eyes? What is't I dream on?
1453	O cunning enemy, that, to catch a saint,
1454	With saints dost bait thy hook! Most dangerous
1455	Is that temptation that doth goad us on
1456	To sin in loving virtue: never could the strumpet,
1457	With all her double vigour, art and nature,
1458	Once stir my temper; but this virtuous maid
1459	Subdues me quite. Even till now,
1460	When men were fond, I smiled and wonder'd how.

1475	
1476	[Enter, severally, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as a
1477	friar, and Provost]
1478	
1479	DUKE VINCENTIO	Hail to you, provost! so I think you are.
1480	
1481	Provost	I am the provost. What's your will, good friar?
1482	
1483	DUKE VINCENTIO	Bound by my charity and my blest order,
1484	I come to visit the afflicted spirits
1485	Here in the prison. Do me the common right
1486	To let me see them and to make me know
1487	The nature of their crimes, that I may minister
1488	To them accordingly.
1489	
1490	Provost	I would do more than that, if more were needful.
1491	
1492	[Enter JULIET]
1493	
1494	Look, here comes one: a gentlewoman of mine,
1495	Who, falling in the flaws of her own youth,
1496	Hath blister'd her report: she is with child;
1497	And he that got it, sentenced; a young man
1498	More fit to do another such offence
1499	Than die for this.
1500	
1501	DUKE VINCENTIO	When must he die?
1502	
1503	Provost	                  As I do think, to-morrow.
1504	I have provided for you: stay awhile,
1505	
1506	[To JULIET]
1507	
1508	And you shall be conducted.
1509	
1510	DUKE VINCENTIO	Repent you, fair one, of the sin you carry?
1511	
1512	JULIET	I do; and bear the shame most patiently.
1513	
1514	DUKE VINCENTIO	I'll teach you how you shall arraign your conscience,
1515	And try your penitence, if it be sound,
1516	Or hollowly put on.
1517	
1518	JULIET	I'll gladly learn.
1519	
1520	DUKE VINCENTIO	Love you the man that wrong'd you?
1521	
1522	JULIET	Yes, as I love the woman that wrong'd him.
1523	
1524	DUKE VINCENTIO	So then it seems your most offenceful act
1525	Was mutually committed?
1526	
1527	JULIET	Mutually.
1528	
1529	DUKE VINCENTIO	Then was your sin of heavier kind than his.
1530	
1531	JULIET	I do confess it, and repent it, father.
1532	
1533	DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis meet so, daughter: but lest you do repent,
1534	As that the sin hath brought you to this shame,
1535	Which sorrow is always towards ourselves, not heaven,
1536	Showing we would not spare heaven as we love it,
1537	But as we stand in fear,--
1538	
1539	JULIET	I do repent me, as it is an evil,
1540	And take the shame with joy.
1541	
1542	DUKE VINCENTIO	There rest.
1543	Your partner, as I hear, must die to-morrow,
1544	And I am going with instruction to him.
1545	Grace go with you, Benedicite!

1568	
1569	[Enter ANGELO]
1570	
1571	ANGELO	When I would pray and think, I think and pray
1572	To several subjects. Heaven hath my empty words;
1573	Whilst my invention, hearing not my tongue,
1574	Anchors on Isabel: Heaven in my mouth,
1575	As if I did but only chew his name;
1576	And in my heart the strong and swelling evil
1577	Of my conception. The state, whereon I studied
1578	Is like a good thing, being often read,
1579	Grown fear'd and tedious; yea, my gravity,
1580	Wherein--let no man hear me--I take pride,
1581	Could I with boot change for an idle plume,
1582	Which the air beats for vain. O place, O form,
1583	How often dost thou with thy case, thy habit,
1584	Wrench awe from fools and tie the wiser souls
1585	To thy false seeming! Blood, thou art blood:
1586	Let's write good angel on the devil's horn:
1587	'Tis not the devil's crest.
1588	
1589	[Enter a Servant]
1590	
1591	How now! who's there?
1592	
1593	Servant	One Isabel, a sister, desires access to you.
1594	
1595	ANGELO	Teach her the way.
1596	
1597	[Exit Servant]
1598	
1599	O heavens!
1600	Why does my blood thus muster to my heart,
1601	Making both it unable for itself,
1602	And dispossessing all my other parts
1603	Of necessary fitness?
1604	So play the foolish throngs with one that swoons;
1605	Come all to help him, and so stop the air
1606	By which he should revive: and even so
1607	The general, subject to a well-wish'd king,
1608	Quit their own part, and in obsequious fondness
1609	Crowd to his presence, where their untaught love
1610	Must needs appear offence.
1611	
1612	[Enter ISABELLA]
1613	
1614	How now, fair maid?
1615	
1616	ISABELLA	I am come to know your pleasure.
1617	
1618	ANGELO	That you might know it, would much better please me
1619	Than to demand what 'tis. Your brother cannot live.
1620	
1621	ISABELLA	Even so. Heaven keep your honour!
1622	
1623	ANGELO	Yet may he live awhile; and, it may be,
1624	As long as you or I	yet he must die.
1625	
1626	ISABELLA	Under your sentence?
1627	
1628	ANGELO	Yea.
1629	
1630	ISABELLA	When, I beseech you? that in his reprieve,
1631	Longer or shorter, he may be so fitted
1632	That his soul sicken not.
1633	
1634	ANGELO	Ha! fie, these filthy vices! It were as good
1635	To pardon him that hath from nature stolen
1636	A man already made, as to remit
1637	Their saucy sweetness that do coin heaven's image
1638	In stamps that are forbid: 'tis all as easy
1639	Falsely to take away a life true made
1640	As to put metal in restrained means
1641	To make a false one.
1642	
1643	ISABELLA	'Tis set down so in heaven, but not in earth.
1644	
1645	ANGELO	Say you so? then I shall pose you quickly.
1646	Which had you rather, that the most just law
1647	Now took your brother's life; or, to redeem him,
1648	Give up your body to such sweet uncleanness
1649	As she that he hath stain'd?
1650	
1651	ISABELLA	Sir, believe this,
1652	I had rather give my body than my soul.
1653	
1654	ANGELO	I talk not of your soul: our compell'd sins
1655	Stand more for number than for accompt.
1656	
1657	ISABELLA	How say you?
1658	
1659	ANGELO	Nay, I'll not warrant that; for I can speak
1660	Against the thing I say. Answer to this:
1661	I, now the voice of the recorded law,
1662	Pronounce a sentence on your brother's life:
1663	Might there not be a charity in sin
1664	To save this brother's life?
1665	
1666	ISABELLA	Please you to do't,
1667	I'll take it as a peril to my soul,
1668	It is no sin at all, but charity.
1669	
1670	ANGELO	Pleased you to do't at peril of your soul,
1671	Were equal poise of sin and charity.
1672	
1673	ISABELLA	That I do beg his life, if it be sin,
1674	Heaven let me bear it! you granting of my suit,
1675	If that be sin, I'll make it my morn prayer
1676	To have it added to the faults of mine,
1677	And nothing of your answer.
1678	
1679	ANGELO	Nay, but hear me.
1680	Your sense pursues not mine: either you are ignorant,
1681	Or seem so craftily; and that's not good.
1682	
1683	ISABELLA	Let me be ignorant, and in nothing good,
1684	But graciously to know I am no better.
1685	
1686	ANGELO	Thus wisdom wishes to appear most bright
1687	When it doth tax itself; as these black masks
1688	Proclaim an enshield beauty ten times louder
1689	Than beauty could, display'd. But mark me;
1690	To be received plain, I'll speak more gross:
1691	Your brother is to die.
1692	
1693	ISABELLA	So.
1694	
1695	ANGELO	And his offence is so, as it appears,
1696	Accountant to the law upon that pain.
1697	
1698	ISABELLA	True.
1699	
1700	ANGELO	Admit no other way to save his life,--
1701	As I subscribe not that, nor any other,
1702	But in the loss of question,--that you, his sister,
1703	Finding yourself desired of such a person,
1704	Whose credit with the judge, or own great place,
1705	Could fetch your brother from the manacles
1706	Of the all-building law; and that there were
1707	No earthly mean to save him, but that either
1708	You must lay down the treasures of your body
1709	To this supposed, or else to let him suffer;
1710	What would you do?
1711	
1712	ISABELLA	As much for my poor brother as myself:
1713	That is, were I under the terms of death,
1714	The impression of keen whips I'ld wear as rubies,
1715	And strip myself to death, as to a bed
1716	That longing have been sick for, ere I'ld yield
1717	My body up to shame.
1718	
1719	ANGELO	Then must your brother die.
1720	
1721	ISABELLA	And 'twere the cheaper way:
1722	Better it were a brother died at once,
1723	Than that a sister, by redeeming him,
1724	Should die for ever.
1725	
1726	ANGELO	Were not you then as cruel as the sentence
1727	That you have slander'd so?
1728	
1729	ISABELLA	Ignomy in ransom and free pardon
1730	Are of two houses: lawful mercy
1731	Is nothing kin to foul redemption.
1732	
1733	ANGELO	You seem'd of late to make the law a tyrant;
1734	And rather proved the sliding of your brother
1735	A merriment than a vice.
1736	
1737	ISABELLA	O, pardon me, my lord; it oft falls out,
1738	To have what we would have, we speak not what we mean:
1739	I something do excuse the thing I hate,
1740	For his advantage that I dearly love.
1741	
1742	ANGELO	We are all frail.
1743	
1744	ISABELLA	                  Else let my brother die,
1745	If not a feodary, but only he
1746	Owe and succeed thy weakness.
1747	
1748	ANGELO	Nay, women are frail too.
1749	
1750	ISABELLA	Ay, as the glasses where they view themselves;
1751	Which are as easy broke as they make forms.
1752	Women! Help Heaven! men their creation mar
1753	In profiting by them. Nay, call us ten times frail;
1754	For we are soft as our complexions are,
1755	And credulous to false prints.
1756	
1757	ANGELO	I think it well:
1758	And from this testimony of your own sex,--
1759	Since I suppose we are made to be no stronger
1760	Than faults may shake our frames,--let me be bold;
1761	I do arrest your words. Be that you are,
1762	That is, a woman; if you be more, you're none;
1763	If you be one, as you are well express'd
1764	By all external warrants, show it now,
1765	By putting on the destined livery.
1766	
1767	ISABELLA	I have no tongue but one: gentle my lord,
1768	Let me entreat you speak the former language.
1769	
1770	ANGELO	Plainly conceive, I love you.
1771	
1772	ISABELLA	My brother did love Juliet,
1773	And you tell me that he shall die for it.
1774	
1775	ANGELO	He shall not, Isabel, if you give me love.
1776	
1777	ISABELLA	I know your virtue hath a licence in't,
1778	Which seems a little fouler than it is,
1779	To pluck on others.
1780	
1781	ANGELO	Believe me, on mine honour,
1782	My words express my purpose.
1783	
1784	ISABELLA	Ha! little honour to be much believed,
1785	And most pernicious purpose! Seeming, seeming!
1786	I will proclaim thee, Angelo; look for't:
1787	Sign me a present pardon for my brother,
1788	Or with an outstretch'd throat I'll tell the world aloud
1789	What man thou art.
1790	
1791	ANGELO	                  Who will believe thee, Isabel?
1792	My unsoil'd name, the austereness of my life,
1793	My vouch against you, and my place i' the state,
1794	Will so your accusation overweigh,
1795	That you shall stifle in your own report
1796	And smell of calumny. I have begun,
1797	And now I give my sensual race the rein:
1798	Fit thy consent to my sharp appetite;
1799	Lay by all nicety and prolixious blushes,
1800	That banish what they sue for; redeem thy brother
1801	By yielding up thy body to my will;
1802	Or else he must not only die the death,
1803	But thy unkindness shall his death draw out
1804	To lingering sufferance. Answer me to-morrow,
1805	Or, by the affection that now guides me most,
1806	I'll prove a tyrant to him. As for you,
1807	Say what you can, my false o'erweighs your true.
1808	
1809	[Exit]
1810	
1811	ISABELLA	To whom should I complain? Did I tell this,
1812	Who would believe me? O perilous mouths,
1813	That bear in them one and the self-same tongue,
1814	Either of condemnation or approof;
1815	Bidding the law make court'sy to their will:
1816	Hooking both right and wrong to the appetite,
1817	To follow as it draws! I'll to my brother:
1818	Though he hath fallen by prompture of the blood,
1819	Yet hath he in him such a mind of honour.
1820	That, had he twenty heads to tender down
1821	On twenty bloody blocks, he'ld yield them up,
1822	Before his sister should her body stoop
1823	To such abhorr'd pollution.
1824	Then, Isabel, live chaste, and, brother, die:
1825	More than our brother is our chastity.
1826	I'll tell him yet of Angelo's request,
1827	And fit his mind to death, for his soul's rest.

1837	ACT III
1838	
1839	
1840	SCENE I	A room in the prison.
1841	
1842	
1843	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before, CLAUDIO,
1844	and Provost]
1845	
1846	DUKE VINCENTIO	So then you hope of pardon from Lord Angelo?
1847	
1848	CLAUDIO	The miserable have no other medicine
1849	But only hope:
1850	I've hope to live, and am prepared to die.
1851	
1852	DUKE VINCENTIO	Be absolute for death; either death or life
1853	Shall thereby be the sweeter. Reason thus with life:
1854	If I do lose thee, I do lose a thing
1855	That none but fools would keep: a breath thou art,
1856	Servile to all the skyey influences,
1857	That dost this habitation, where thou keep'st,
1858	Hourly afflict: merely, thou art death's fool;
1859	For him thou labour'st by thy flight to shun
1860	And yet runn'st toward him still. Thou art not noble;
1861	For all the accommodations that thou bear'st
1862	Are nursed by baseness. Thou'rt by no means valiant;
1863	For thou dost fear the soft and tender fork
1864	Of a poor worm. Thy best of rest is sleep,
1865	And that thou oft provokest; yet grossly fear'st
1866	Thy death, which is no more. Thou art not thyself;
1867	For thou exist'st on many a thousand grains
1868	That issue out of dust. Happy thou art not;
1869	For what thou hast not, still thou strivest to get,
1870	And what thou hast, forget'st. Thou art not certain;
1871	For thy complexion shifts to strange effects,
1872	After the moon. If thou art rich, thou'rt poor;
1873	For, like an ass whose back with ingots bows,
1874	Thou bear's thy heavy riches but a journey,
1875	And death unloads thee. Friend hast thou none;
1876	For thine own bowels, which do call thee sire,
1877	The mere effusion of thy proper loins,
1878	Do curse the gout, serpigo, and the rheum,
1879	For ending thee no sooner. Thou hast nor youth nor age,
1880	But, as it were, an after-dinner's sleep,
1881	Dreaming on both; for all thy blessed youth
1882	Becomes as aged, and doth beg the alms
1883	Of palsied eld; and when thou art old and rich,
1884	Thou hast neither heat, affection, limb, nor beauty,
1885	To make thy riches pleasant. What's yet in this
1886	That bears the name of life? Yet in this life
1887	Lie hid moe thousand deaths: yet death we fear,
1888	That makes these odds all even.
1889	
1890	CLAUDIO	I humbly thank you.
1891	To sue to live, I find I seek to die;
1892	And, seeking death, find life: let it come on.
1893	
1894	ISABELLA	[Within]  What, ho! Peace here; grace and good company!
1895	
1896	Provost	Who's there? come in: the wish deserves a welcome.
1897	
1898	DUKE VINCENTIO	Dear sir, ere long I'll visit you again.
1899	
1900	CLAUDIO	Most holy sir, I thank you.
1901	
1902	[Enter ISABELLA]
1903	
1904	ISABELLA	My business is a word or two with Claudio.
1905	
1906	Provost	And very welcome. Look, signior, here's your sister.
1907	
1908	DUKE VINCENTIO	Provost, a word with you.
1909	
1910	Provost	As many as you please.
1911	
1912	DUKE VINCENTIO	Bring me to hear them speak, where I may be concealed.
1913	
1914	[Exeunt DUKE VINCENTIO and Provost]
1915	
1916	CLAUDIO	Now, sister, what's the comfort?
1917	
1918	ISABELLA	Why,
1919	As all comforts are; most good, most good indeed.
1920	Lord Angelo, having affairs to heaven,
1921	Intends you for his swift ambassador,
1922	Where you shall be an everlasting leiger:
1923	Therefore your best appointment make with speed;
1924	To-morrow you set on.
1925	
1926	CLAUDIO	Is there no remedy?
1927	
1928	ISABELLA	None, but such remedy as, to save a head,
1929	To cleave a heart in twain.
1930	
1931	CLAUDIO	But is there any?
1932	
1933	ISABELLA	Yes, brother, you may live:
1934	There is a devilish mercy in the judge,
1935	If you'll implore it, that will free your life,
1936	But fetter you till death.
1937	
1938	CLAUDIO	Perpetual durance?
1939	
1940	ISABELLA	Ay, just; perpetual durance, a restraint,
1941	Though all the world's vastidity you had,
1942	To a determined scope.
1943	
1944	CLAUDIO	But in what nature?
1945	
1946	ISABELLA	In such a one as, you consenting to't,
1947	Would bark your honour from that trunk you bear,
1948	And leave you naked.
1949	
1950	CLAUDIO	Let me know the point.
1951	
1952	ISABELLA	O, I do fear thee, Claudio; and I quake,
1953	Lest thou a feverous life shouldst entertain,
1954	And six or seven winters more respect
1955	Than a perpetual honour. Darest thou die?
1956	The sense of death is most in apprehension;
1957	And the poor beetle, that we tread upon,
1958	In corporal sufferance finds a pang as great
1959	As when a giant dies.
1960	
1961	CLAUDIO	Why give you me this shame?
1962	Think you I can a resolution fetch
1963	From flowery tenderness? If I must die,
1964	I will encounter darkness as a bride,
1965	And hug it in mine arms.
1966	
1967	ISABELLA	There spake my brother; there my father's grave
1968	Did utter forth a voice. Yes, thou must die:
1969	Thou art too noble to conserve a life
1970	In base appliances. This outward-sainted deputy,
1971	Whose settled visage and deliberate word
1972	Nips youth i' the head and follies doth emmew
1973	As falcon doth the fowl, is yet a devil
1974	His filth within being cast, he would appear
1975	A pond as deep as hell.
1976	
1977	CLAUDIO	The prenzie Angelo!
1978	
1979	ISABELLA	O, 'tis the cunning livery of hell,
1980	The damned'st body to invest and cover
1981	In prenzie guards! Dost thou think, Claudio?
1982	If I would yield him my virginity,
1983	Thou mightst be freed.
1984	
1985	CLAUDIO	O heavens! it cannot be.
1986	
1987	ISABELLA	Yes, he would give't thee, from this rank offence,
1988	So to offend him still. This night's the time
1989	That I should do what I abhor to name,
1990	Or else thou diest to-morrow.
1991	
1992	CLAUDIO	Thou shalt not do't.
1993	
1994	ISABELLA	O, were it but my life,
1995	I'ld throw it down for your deliverance
1996	As frankly as a pin.
1997	
1998	CLAUDIO	Thanks, dear Isabel.
1999	
2000	ISABELLA	Be ready, Claudio, for your death tomorrow.
2001	
2002	CLAUDIO	Yes. Has he affections in him,
2003	That thus can make him bite the law by the nose,
2004	When he would force it? Sure, it is no sin,
2005	Or of the deadly seven, it is the least.
2006	
2007	ISABELLA	Which is the least?
2008	
2009	CLAUDIO	If it were damnable, he being so wise,
2010	Why would he for the momentary trick
2011	Be perdurably fined? O Isabel!
2012	
2013	ISABELLA	What says my brother?
2014	
2015	CLAUDIO	Death is a fearful thing.
2016	
2017	ISABELLA	And shamed life a hateful.
2018	
2019	CLAUDIO	Ay, but to die, and go we know not where;
2020	To lie in cold obstruction and to rot;
2021	This sensible warm motion to become
2022	A kneaded clod; and the delighted spirit
2023	To bathe in fiery floods, or to reside
2024	In thrilling region of thick-ribbed ice;
2025	To be imprison'd in the viewless winds,
2026	And blown with restless violence round about
2027	The pendent world; or to be worse than worst
2028	Of those that lawless and incertain thought
2029	Imagine howling: 'tis too horrible!
2030	The weariest and most loathed worldly life
2031	That age, ache, penury and imprisonment
2032	Can lay on nature is a paradise
2033	To what we fear of death.
2034	
2035	ISABELLA	Alas, alas!
2036	
2037	CLAUDIO	          Sweet sister, let me live:
2038	What sin you do to save a brother's life,
2039	Nature dispenses with the deed so far
2040	That it becomes a virtue.
2041	
2042	ISABELLA	O you beast!
2043	O faithless coward! O dishonest wretch!
2044	Wilt thou be made a man out of my vice?
2045	Is't not a kind of incest, to take life
2046	From thine own sister's shame? What should I think?
2047	Heaven shield my mother play'd my father fair!
2048	For such a warped slip of wilderness
2049	Ne'er issued from his blood. Take my defiance!
2050	Die, perish! Might but my bending down
2051	Reprieve thee from thy fate, it should proceed:
2052	I'll pray a thousand prayers for thy death,
2053	No word to save thee.
2054	
2055	CLAUDIO	Nay, hear me, Isabel.
2056	
2057	ISABELLA	O, fie, fie, fie!
2058	Thy sin's not accidental, but a trade.
2059	Mercy to thee would prove itself a bawd:
2060	'Tis best thou diest quickly.
2061	
2062	CLAUDIO	O hear me, Isabella!
2063	
2064	[Re-enter DUKE VINCENTIO]
2065	
2066	DUKE VINCENTIO	Vouchsafe a word, young sister, but one word.
2067	
2068	ISABELLA	What is your will?
2069	
2070	DUKE VINCENTIO	Might you dispense with your leisure, I would by and
2071	by have some speech with you: the satisfaction I
2072	would require is likewise your own benefit.
2073	
2074	ISABELLA	I have no superfluous leisure; my stay must be
2075	stolen out of other affairs; but I will attend you awhile.
2076	
2077	[Walks apart]
2078	
2079	DUKE VINCENTIO	Son, I have overheard what hath passed between you
2080	and your sister. Angelo had never the purpose to
2081	corrupt her; only he hath made an essay of her
2082	virtue to practise his judgment with the disposition
2083	of natures: she, having the truth of honour in her,
2084	hath made him that gracious denial which he is most
2085	glad to receive. I am confessor to Angelo, and I
2086	know this to be true; therefore prepare yourself to
2087	death: do not satisfy your resolution with hopes
2088	that are fallible: tomorrow you must die; go to
2089	your knees and make ready.
2090	
2091	CLAUDIO	Let me ask my sister pardon. I am so out of love
2092	with life that I will sue to be rid of it.
2093	
2094	DUKE VINCENTIO	Hold you there: farewell.
2095	
2096	[Exit CLAUDIO]
2097	
2098	Provost, a word with you!
2099	
2100	[Re-enter Provost]
2101	
2102	Provost	What's your will, father
2103	
2104	DUKE VINCENTIO	That now you are come, you will be gone. Leave me
2105	awhile with the maid: my mind promises with my
2106	habit no loss shall touch her by my company.
2107	
2108	Provost	In good time.
2109	
2110	[Exit Provost. ISABELLA comes forward]
2111	
2112	DUKE VINCENTIO	The hand that hath made you fair hath made you good:
2113	the goodness that is cheap in beauty makes beauty
2114	brief in goodness; but grace, being the soul of
2115	your complexion, shall keep the body of it ever
2116	fair. The assault that Angelo hath made to you,
2117	fortune hath conveyed to my understanding; and, but
2118	that frailty hath examples for his falling, I should
2119	wonder at Angelo. How will you do to content this
2120	substitute, and to save your brother?
2121	
2122	ISABELLA	I am now going to resolve him: I had rather my
2123	brother die by the law than my son should be
2124	unlawfully born. But, O, how much is the good duke
2125	deceived in Angelo! If ever he return and I can
2126	speak to him, I will open my lips in vain, or
2127	discover his government.
2128	
2129	DUKE VINCENTIO	That shall not be much amiss: Yet, as the matter
2130	now stands, he will avoid your accusation; he made
2131	trial of you only. Therefore fasten your ear on my
2132	advisings: to the love I have in doing good a
2133	remedy presents itself. I do make myself believe
2134	that you may most uprighteously do a poor wronged
2135	lady a merited benefit; redeem your brother from
2136	the angry law; do no stain to your own gracious
2137	person; and much please the absent duke, if
2138	peradventure he shall ever return to have hearing of
2139	this business.
2140	
2141	ISABELLA	Let me hear you speak farther. I have spirit to do
2142	anything that appears not foul in the truth of my spirit.
2143	
2144	DUKE VINCENTIO	Virtue is bold, and goodness never fearful. Have
2145	you not heard speak of Mariana, the sister of
2146	Frederick the great soldier who miscarried at sea?
2147	
2148	ISABELLA	I have heard of the lady, and good words went with her name.
2149	
2150	DUKE VINCENTIO	She should this Angelo have married; was affianced
2151	to her by oath, and the nuptial appointed: between
2152	which time of the contract and limit of the
2153	solemnity, her brother Frederick was wrecked at sea,
2154	having in that perished vessel the dowry of his
2155	sister. But mark how heavily this befell to the
2156	poor gentlewoman: there she lost a noble and
2157	renowned brother, in his love toward her ever most
2158	kind and natural; with him, the portion and sinew of
2159	her fortune, her marriage-dowry; with both, her
2160	combinate husband, this well-seeming Angelo.
2161	
2162	ISABELLA	Can this be so? did Angelo so leave her?
2163	
2164	DUKE VINCENTIO	Left her in her tears, and dried not one of them
2165	with his comfort; swallowed his vows whole,
2166	pretending in her discoveries of dishonour: in few,
2167	bestowed her on her own lamentation, which she yet
2168	wears for his sake; and he, a marble to her tears,
2169	is washed with them, but relents not.
2170	
2171	ISABELLA	What a merit were it in death to take this poor maid
2172	from the world! What corruption in this life, that
2173	it will let this man live! But how out of this can she avail?
2174	
2175	DUKE VINCENTIO	It is a rupture that you may easily heal: and the
2176	cure of it not only saves your brother, but keeps
2177	you from dishonour in doing it.
2178	
2179	ISABELLA	Show me how, good father.
2180	
2181	DUKE VINCENTIO	This forenamed maid hath yet in her the continuance
2182	of her first affection: his unjust unkindness, that
2183	in all reason should have quenched her love, hath,
2184	like an impediment in the current, made it more
2185	violent and unruly. Go you to Angelo; answer his
2186	requiring with a plausible obedience; agree with
2187	his demands to the point; only refer yourself to
2188	this advantage, first, that your stay with him may
2189	not be long; that the time may have all shadow and
2190	silence in it; and the place answer to convenience.
2191	This being granted in course,--and now follows
2192	all,--we shall advise this wronged maid to stead up
2193	your appointment, go in your place; if the encounter
2194	acknowledge itself hereafter, it may compel him to
2195	her recompense: and here, by this, is your brother
2196	saved, your honour untainted, the poor Mariana
2197	advantaged, and the corrupt deputy scaled. The maid
2198	will I frame and make fit for his attempt. If you
2199	think well to carry this as you may, the doubleness
2200	of the benefit defends the deceit from reproof.
2201	What think you of it?
2202	
2203	ISABELLA	The image of it gives me content already; and I
2204	trust it will grow to a most prosperous perfection.
2205	
2206	DUKE VINCENTIO	It lies much in your holding up. Haste you speedily
2207	to Angelo: if for this night he entreat you to his
2208	bed, give him promise of satisfaction. I will
2209	presently to Saint Luke's: there, at the moated
2210	grange, resides this dejected Mariana. At that
2211	place call upon me; and dispatch with Angelo, that
2212	it may be quickly.
2213	
2214	ISABELLA	I thank you for this comfort. Fare you well, good father.

2231	[Enter, on one side, DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as
2232	before; on the other, ELBOW, and Officers with POMPEY]
2233	
2234	ELBOW	Nay, if there be no remedy for it, but that you will
2235	needs buy and sell men and women like beasts, we
2236	shall have all the world drink brown and white bastard.
2237	
2238	DUKE VINCENTIO	O heavens! what stuff is here
2239	
2240	POMPEY	'Twas never merry world since, of two usuries, the
2241	merriest was put down, and the worser allowed by
2242	order of law a furred gown to keep him warm; and
2243	furred with fox and lamb-skins too, to signify, that
2244	craft, being richer than innocency, stands for the facing.
2245	
2246	ELBOW	Come your way, sir. 'Bless you, good father friar.
2247	
2248	DUKE VINCENTIO	And you, good brother father. What offence hath
2249	this man made you, sir?
2250	
2251	ELBOW	Marry, sir, he hath offended the law: and, sir, we
2252	take him to be a thief too, sir; for we have found
2253	upon him, sir, a strange picklock, which we have
2254	sent to the deputy.
2255	
2256	DUKE VINCENTIO	Fie, sirrah! a bawd, a wicked bawd!
2257	The evil that thou causest to be done,
2258	That is thy means to live. Do thou but think
2259	What 'tis to cram a maw or clothe a back
2260	From such a filthy vice: say to thyself,
2261	From their abominable and beastly touches
2262	I drink, I eat, array myself, and live.
2263	Canst thou believe thy living is a life,
2264	So stinkingly depending? Go mend, go mend.
2265	
2266	POMPEY	Indeed, it does stink in some sort, sir; but yet,
2267	sir, I would prove--
2268	
2269	DUKE VINCENTIO	Nay, if the devil have given thee proofs for sin,
2270	Thou wilt prove his. Take him to prison, officer:
2271	Correction and instruction must both work
2272	Ere this rude beast will profit.
2273	
2274	ELBOW	He must before the deputy, sir; he has given him
2275	warning: the deputy cannot abide a whoremaster: if
2276	he be a whoremonger, and comes before him, he were
2277	as good go a mile on his errand.
2278	
2279	DUKE VINCENTIO	That we were all, as some would seem to be,
2280	From our faults, as faults from seeming, free!
2281	
2282	ELBOW	His neck will come to your waist,--a cord, sir.
2283	
2284	POMPEY	I spy comfort; I cry bail. Here's a gentleman and a
2285	friend of mine.
2286	
2287	[Enter LUCIO]
2288	
2289	LUCIO	How now, noble Pompey! What, at the wheels of
2290	Caesar? art thou led in triumph? What, is there
2291	none of Pygmalion's images, newly made woman, to be
2292	had now, for putting the hand in the pocket and
2293	extracting it clutch'd? What reply, ha? What
2294	sayest thou to this tune, matter and method? Is't
2295	not drowned i' the last rain, ha? What sayest
2296	thou, Trot? Is the world as it was, man? Which is
2297	the way? Is it sad, and few words? or how? The
2298	trick of it?
2299	
2300	DUKE VINCENTIO	Still thus, and thus; still worse!
2301	
2302	LUCIO	How doth my dear morsel, thy mistress? Procures she
2303	still, ha?
2304	
2305	POMPEY	Troth, sir, she hath eaten up all her beef, and she
2306	is herself in the tub.
2307	
2308	LUCIO	Why, 'tis good; it is the right of it; it must be
2309	so: ever your fresh whore and your powdered bawd:
2310	an unshunned consequence; it must be so. Art going
2311	to prison, Pompey?
2312	
2313	POMPEY	Yes, faith, sir.
2314	
2315	LUCIO	Why, 'tis not amiss, Pompey. Farewell: go, say I
2316	sent thee thither. For debt, Pompey? or how?
2317	
2318	ELBOW	For being a bawd, for being a bawd.
2319	
2320	LUCIO	Well, then, imprison him: if imprisonment be the
2321	due of a bawd, why, 'tis his right: bawd is he
2322	doubtless, and of antiquity too; bawd-born.
2323	Farewell, good Pompey. Commend me to the prison,
2324	Pompey: you will turn good husband now, Pompey; you
2325	will keep the house.
2326	
2327	POMPEY	I hope, sir, your good worship will be my bail.
2328	
2329	LUCIO	No, indeed, will I not, Pompey; it is not the wear.
2330	I will pray, Pompey, to increase your bondage: If
2331	you take it not patiently, why, your mettle is the
2332	more. Adieu, trusty Pompey. 'Bless you, friar.
2333	
2334	DUKE VINCENTIO	And you.
2335	
2336	LUCIO	Does Bridget paint still, Pompey, ha?
2337	
2338	ELBOW	Come your ways, sir; come.
2339	
2340	POMPEY	You will not bail me, then, sir?
2341	
2342	LUCIO	Then, Pompey, nor now. What news abroad, friar?
2343	what news?
2344	
2345	ELBOW	Come your ways, sir; come.
2346	
2347	LUCIO	Go to kennel, Pompey; go.
2348	
2349	[Exeunt ELBOW, POMPEY and Officers]
2350	
2351	What news, friar, of the duke?
2352	
2353	DUKE VINCENTIO	I know none. Can you tell me of any?
2354	
2355	LUCIO	Some say he is with the Emperor of Russia; other
2356	some, he is in Rome: but where is he, think you?
2357	
2358	DUKE VINCENTIO	I know not where; but wheresoever, I wish him well.
2359	
2360	LUCIO	It was a mad fantastical trick of him to steal from
2361	the state, and usurp the beggary he was never born
2362	to. Lord Angelo dukes it well in his absence; he
2363	puts transgression to 't.
2364	
2365	DUKE VINCENTIO	He does well in 't.
2366	
2367	LUCIO	A little more lenity to lechery would do no harm in
2368	him: something too crabbed that way, friar.
2369	
2370	DUKE VINCENTIO	It is too general a vice, and severity must cure it.
2371	
2372	LUCIO	Yes, in good sooth, the vice is of a great kindred;
2373	it is well allied: but it is impossible to extirp
2374	it quite, friar, till eating and drinking be put
2375	down. They say this Angelo was not made by man and
2376	woman after this downright way of creation: is it
2377	true, think you?
2378	
2379	DUKE VINCENTIO	How should he be made, then?
2380	
2381	LUCIO	Some report a sea-maid spawned him; some, that he
2382	was begot between two stock-fishes. But it is
2383	certain that when he makes water his urine is
2384	congealed ice; that I know to be true: and he is a
2385	motion generative; that's infallible.
2386	
2387	DUKE VINCENTIO	You are pleasant, sir, and speak apace.
2388	
2389	LUCIO	Why, what a ruthless thing is this in him, for the
2390	rebellion of a codpiece to take away the life of a
2391	man! Would the duke that is absent have done this?
2392	Ere he would have hanged a man for the getting a
2393	hundred bastards, he would have paid for the nursing
2394	a thousand: he had some feeling of the sport: he
2395	knew the service, and that instructed him to mercy.
2396	
2397	DUKE VINCENTIO	I never heard the absent duke much detected for
2398	women; he was not inclined that way.
2399	
2400	LUCIO	O, sir, you are deceived.
2401	
2402	DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis not possible.
2403	
2404	LUCIO	Who, not the duke? yes, your beggar of fifty; and
2405	his use was to put a ducat in her clack-dish: the
2406	duke had crotchets in him. He would be drunk too;
2407	that let me inform you.
2408	
2409	DUKE VINCENTIO	You do him wrong, surely.
2410	
2411	LUCIO	Sir, I was an inward of his. A shy fellow was the
2412	duke: and I believe I know the cause of his
2413	withdrawing.
2414	
2415	DUKE VINCENTIO	What, I prithee, might be the cause?
2416	
2417	LUCIO	No, pardon; 'tis a secret must be locked within the
2418	teeth and the lips: but this I can let you
2419	understand, the greater file of the subject held the
2420	duke to be wise.
2421	
2422	DUKE VINCENTIO	Wise! why, no question but he was.
2423	
2424	LUCIO	A very superficial, ignorant, unweighing fellow.
2425	
2426	DUKE VINCENTIO	Either this is the envy in you, folly, or mistaking:
2427	the very stream of his life and the business he hath
2428	helmed must upon a warranted need give him a better
2429	proclamation. Let him be but testimonied in his own
2430	bringings-forth, and he shall appear to the
2431	envious a scholar, a statesman and a soldier.
2432	Therefore you speak unskilfully: or if your
2433	knowledge be more it is much darkened in your malice.
2434	
2435	LUCIO	Sir, I know him, and I love him.
2436	
2437	DUKE VINCENTIO	Love talks with better knowledge, and knowledge with
2438	dearer love.
2439	
2440	LUCIO	Come, sir, I know what I know.
2441	
2442	DUKE VINCENTIO	I can hardly believe that, since you know not what
2443	you speak. But, if ever the duke return, as our
2444	prayers are he may, let me desire you to make your
2445	answer before him. If it be honest you have spoke,
2446	you have courage to maintain it: I am bound to call
2447	upon you; and, I pray you, your name?
2448	
2449	LUCIO	Sir, my name is Lucio; well known to the duke.
2450	
2451	DUKE VINCENTIO	He shall know you better, sir, if I may live to
2452	report you.
2453	
2454	LUCIO	I fear you not.
2455	
2456	DUKE VINCENTIO	O, you hope the duke will return no more; or you
2457	imagine me too unhurtful an opposite. But indeed I
2458	can do you little harm; you'll forswear this again.
2459	
2460	LUCIO	I'll be hanged first: thou art deceived in me,
2461	friar. But no more of this. Canst thou tell if
2462	Claudio die to-morrow or no?
2463	
2464	DUKE VINCENTIO	Why should he die, sir?
2465	
2466	LUCIO	Why? For filling a bottle with a tundish. I would
2467	the duke we talk of were returned again: the
2468	ungenitured agent will unpeople the province with
2469	continency; sparrows must not build in his
2470	house-eaves, because they are lecherous. The duke
2471	yet would have dark deeds darkly answered; he would
2472	never bring them to light: would he were returned!
2473	Marry, this Claudio is condemned for untrussing.
2474	Farewell, good friar: I prithee, pray for me. The
2475	duke, I say to thee again, would eat mutton on
2476	Fridays. He's not past it yet, and I say to thee,
2477	he would mouth with a beggar, though she smelt brown
2478	bread and garlic: say that I said so. Farewell.
2479	
2480	[Exit]
2481	
2482	DUKE VINCENTIO	No might nor greatness in mortality
2483	Can censure 'scape; back-wounding calumny
2484	The whitest virtue strikes. What king so strong
2485	Can tie the gall up in the slanderous tongue?
2486	But who comes here?
2487	
2488	[Enter ESCALUS, Provost, and Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]
2489	
2490	ESCALUS	Go; away with her to prison!
2491	
2492	MISTRESS OVERDONE	Good my lord, be good to me; your honour is accounted
2493	a merciful man; good my lord.
2494	
2495	ESCALUS	Double and treble admonition, and still forfeit in
2496	the same kind! This would make mercy swear and play
2497	the tyrant.
2498	
2499	Provost	A bawd of eleven years' continuance, may it please
2500	your honour.
2501	
2502	MISTRESS OVERDONE	My lord, this is one Lucio's information against me.
2503	Mistress Kate Keepdown was with child by him in the
2504	duke's time; he promised her marriage: his child
2505	is a year and a quarter old, come Philip and Jacob:
2506	I have kept it myself; and see how he goes about to abuse me!
2507	
2508	ESCALUS	That fellow is a fellow of much licence: let him be
2509	called before us. Away with her to prison! Go to;
2510	no more words.
2511	
2512	[Exeunt Officers with MISTRESS OVERDONE]
2513	
2514	Provost, my brother Angelo will not be altered;
2515	Claudio must die to-morrow: let him be furnished
2516	with divines, and have all charitable preparation.
2517	if my brother wrought by my pity, it should not be
2518	so with him.
2519	
2520	Provost	So please you, this friar hath been with him, and
2521	advised him for the entertainment of death.
2522	
2523	ESCALUS	Good even, good father.
2524	
2525	DUKE VINCENTIO	Bliss and goodness on you!
2526	
2527	ESCALUS	Of whence are you?
2528	
2529	DUKE VINCENTIO	Not of this country, though my chance is now
2530	To use it for my time: I am a brother
2531	Of gracious order, late come from the See
2532	In special business from his holiness.
2533	
2534	ESCALUS	What news abroad i' the world?
2535	
2536	DUKE VINCENTIO	None, but that there is so great a fever on
2537	goodness, that the dissolution of it must cure it:
2538	novelty is only in request; and it is as dangerous
2539	to be aged in any kind of course, as it is virtuous
2540	to be constant in any undertaking. There is scarce
2541	truth enough alive to make societies secure; but
2542	security enough to make fellowships accurst: much
2543	upon this riddle runs the wisdom of the world. This
2544	news is old enough, yet it is every day's news. I
2545	pray you, sir, of what disposition was the duke?
2546	
2547	ESCALUS	One that, above all other strifes, contended
2548	especially to know himself.
2549	
2550	DUKE VINCENTIO	What pleasure was he given to?
2551	
2552	ESCALUS	Rather rejoicing to see another merry, than merry at
2553	any thing which professed to make him rejoice: a
2554	gentleman of all temperance. But leave we him to
2555	his events, with a prayer they may prove prosperous;
2556	and let me desire to know how you find Claudio
2557	prepared. I am made to understand that you have
2558	lent him visitation.
2559	
2560	DUKE VINCENTIO	He professes to have received no sinister measure
2561	from his judge, but most willingly humbles himself
2562	to the determination of justice: yet had he framed
2563	to himself, by the instruction of his frailty, many
2564	deceiving promises of life; which I by my good
2565	leisure have discredited to him, and now is he
2566	resolved to die.
2567	
2568	ESCALUS	You have paid the heavens your function, and the
2569	prisoner the very debt of your calling. I have
2570	laboured for the poor gentleman to the extremest
2571	shore of my modesty: but my brother justice have I
2572	found so severe, that he hath forced me to tell him
2573	he is indeed Justice.
2574	
2575	DUKE VINCENTIO	If his own life answer the straitness of his
2576	proceeding, it shall become him well; wherein if he
2577	chance to fail, he hath sentenced himself.
2578	
2579	ESCALUS	I am going to visit the prisoner. Fare you well.
2580	
2581	DUKE VINCENTIO	Peace be with you!
2582	
2583	[Exeunt ESCALUS and Provost]
2584	
2585	He who the sword of heaven will bear
2586	Should be as holy as severe;
2587	Pattern in himself to know,
2588	Grace to stand, and virtue go;
2589	More nor less to others paying
2590	Than by self-offences weighing.
2591	Shame to him whose cruel striking
2592	Kills for faults of his own liking!
2593	Twice treble shame on Angelo,
2594	To weed my vice and let his grow!
2595	O, what may man within him hide,
2596	Though angel on the outward side!
2597	How may likeness made in crimes,
2598	Making practise on the times,
2599	To draw with idle spiders' strings
2600	Most ponderous and substantial things!
2601	Craft against vice I must apply:
2602	With Angelo to-night shall lie
2603	His old betrothed but despised;
2604	So disguise shall, by the disguised,
2605	Pay with falsehood false exacting,
2606	And perform an old contracting.

2643	Let me excuse me, and believe me so,
2644	My mirth it much displeased, but pleased my woe.
2645	
2646	DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis good; though music oft hath such a charm
2647	To make bad good, and good provoke to harm.
2648	I pray, you, tell me, hath any body inquired
2649	for me here to-day? much upon this time have
2650	I promised here to meet.

2668	ISABELLA	He hath a garden circummured with brick,
2669	Whose western side is with a vineyard back'd;
2670	And to that vineyard is a planched gate,
2671	That makes his opening with this bigger key:
2672	This other doth command a little door
2673	Which from the vineyard to the garden leads;
2674	There have I made my promise
2675	Upon the heavy middle of the night
2676	To call upon him.
2677	
2678	DUKE VINCENTIO	But shall you on your knowledge find this way?
2679	
2680	ISABELLA	I have ta'en a due and wary note upon't:
2681	With whispering and most guilty diligence,
2682	In action all of precept, he did show me
2683	The way twice o'er.
2684	
2685	DUKE VINCENTIO	Are there no other tokens
2686	Between you 'greed concerning her observance?
2687	
2688	ISABELLA	No, none, but only a repair i' the dark;
2689	And that I have possess'd him my most stay
2690	Can be but brief; for I have made him know
2691	I have a servant comes with me along,
2692	That stays upon me, whose persuasion is
2693	I come about my brother.
2694	
2695	DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis well borne up.
2696	I have not yet made known to Mariana
2697	A word of this. What, ho! within! come forth!
2698	
2699	[Re-enter MARIANA]
2700	
2701	I pray you, be acquainted with this maid;
2702	She comes to do you good.
2703	
2704	ISABELLA	I do desire the like.
2705	
2706	DUKE VINCENTIO	Do you persuade yourself that I respect you?
2707	
2708	MARIANA	Good friar, I know you do, and have found it.
2709	
2710	DUKE VINCENTIO	Take, then, this your companion by the hand,
2711	Who hath a story ready for your ear.
2712	I shall attend your leisure: but make haste;
2713	The vaporous night approaches.
2714	
2715	MARIANA	Will't please you walk aside?
2716	
2717	[Exeunt MARIANA and ISABELLA]
2718	
2719	DUKE VINCENTIO	O place and greatness! millions of false eyes
2720	Are stuck upon thee: volumes of report
2721	Run with these false and most contrarious quests
2722	Upon thy doings: thousand escapes of wit
2723	Make thee the father of their idle dreams
2724	And rack thee in their fancies.
2725	
2726	[Re-enter MARIANA and ISABELLA]
2727	
2728	Welcome, how agreed?
2729	
2730	ISABELLA	She'll take the enterprise upon her, father,
2731	If you advise it.
2732	
2733	DUKE VINCENTIO	                  It is not my consent,
2734	But my entreaty too.
2735	
2736	ISABELLA	Little have you to say
2737	When you depart from him, but, soft and low,
2738	'Remember now my brother.'
2739	
2740	MARIANA	Fear me not.
2741	
2742	DUKE VINCENTIO	Nor, gentle daughter, fear you not at all.
2743	He is your husband on a pre-contract:
2744	To bring you thus together, 'tis no sin,
2745	Sith that the justice of your title to him
2746	Doth flourish the deceit. Come, let us go:
2747	Our corn's to reap, for yet our tithe's to sow.

2757	ACT IV
2758	
2759	
2760	SCENE II	A room in the prison.
2761	
2762	
2763	[Enter Provost and POMPEY]
2764	
2765	Provost	Come hither, sirrah. Can you cut off a man's head?
2766	
2767	POMPEY	If the man be a bachelor, sir, I can; but if he be a
2768	married man, he's his wife's head, and I can never
2769	cut off a woman's head.
2770	
2771	Provost	Come, sir, leave me your snatches, and yield me a
2772	direct answer. To-morrow morning are to die Claudio
2773	and Barnardine. Here is in our prison a common
2774	executioner, who in his office lacks a helper: if
2775	you will take it on you to assist him, it shall
2776	redeem you from your gyves; if not, you shall have
2777	your full time of imprisonment and your deliverance
2778	with an unpitied whipping, for you have been a
2779	notorious bawd.
2780	
2781	POMPEY	Sir, I have been an unlawful bawd time out of mind;
2782	but yet I will be content to be a lawful hangman. I
2783	would be glad to receive some instruction from my
2784	fellow partner.
2785	
2786	Provost	What, ho! Abhorson! Where's Abhorson, there?
2787	
2788	[Enter ABHORSON]
2789	
2790	ABHORSON	Do you call, sir?
2791	
2792	Provost	Sirrah, here's a fellow will help you to-morrow in
2793	your execution. If you think it meet, compound with
2794	him by the year, and let him abide here with you; if
2795	not, use him for the present and dismiss him. He
2796	cannot plead his estimation with you; he hath been a bawd.
2797	
2798	ABHORSON	A bawd, sir? fie upon him! he will discredit our mystery.
2799	
2800	Provost	Go to, sir; you weigh equally; a feather will turn
2801	the scale.
2802	
2803	[Exit]
2804	
2805	POMPEY	Pray, sir, by your good favour,--for surely, sir, a
2806	good favour you have, but that you have a hanging
2807	look,--do you call, sir, your occupation a mystery?
2808	
2809	ABHORSON	Ay, sir; a mystery
2810	
2811	POMPEY	Painting, sir, I have heard say, is a mystery; and
2812	your whores, sir, being members of my occupation,
2813	using painting, do prove my occupation a mystery:
2814	but what mystery there should be in hanging, if I
2815	should be hanged, I cannot imagine.
2816	
2817	ABHORSON	Sir, it is a mystery.
2818	
2819	POMPEY	Proof?
2820	
2821	ABHORSON	Every true man's apparel fits your thief: if it be
2822	too little for your thief, your true man thinks it
2823	big enough; if it be too big for your thief, your
2824	thief thinks it little enough: so every true man's
2825	apparel fits your thief.
2826	
2827	[Re-enter Provost]
2828	
2829	Provost	Are you agreed?
2830	
2831	POMPEY	Sir, I will serve him; for I do find your hangman is
2832	a more penitent trade than your bawd; he doth
2833	oftener ask forgiveness.
2834	
2835	Provost	You, sirrah, provide your block and your axe
2836	to-morrow four o'clock.
2837	
2838	ABHORSON	Come on, bawd; I will instruct thee in my trade; follow.
2839	
2840	POMPEY	I do desire to learn, sir: and I hope, if you have
2841	occasion to use me for your own turn, you shall find
2842	me yare; for truly, sir, for your kindness I owe you
2843	a good turn.
2844	
2845	Provost	Call hither Barnardine and Claudio:
2846	
2847	[Exeunt POMPEY and ABHORSON]
2848	
2849	The one has my pity; not a jot the other,
2850	Being a murderer, though he were my brother.
2851	
2852	[Enter CLAUDIO]
2853	
2854	Look, here's the warrant, Claudio, for thy death:
2855	'Tis now dead midnight, and by eight to-morrow
2856	Thou must be made immortal. Where's Barnardine?
2857	
2858	CLAUDIO	As fast lock'd up in sleep as guiltless labour
2859	When it lies starkly in the traveller's bones:
2860	He will not wake.
2861	
2862	Provost	                  Who can do good on him?
2863	Well, go, prepare yourself.
2864	
2865	[Knocking within]
2866	
2867	But, hark, what noise?
2868	Heaven give your spirits comfort!
2869	
2870	[Exit CLAUDIO]
2871	
2872	By and by.
2873	I hope it is some pardon or reprieve
2874	For the most gentle Claudio.
2875	
2876	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]
2877	
2878	Welcome father.
2879	
2880	DUKE VINCENTIO	The best and wholesomest spirts of the night
2881	Envelope you, good Provost! Who call'd here of late?
2882	
2883	Provost	None, since the curfew rung.
2884	
2885	DUKE VINCENTIO	Not Isabel?
2886	
2887	Provost	          No.
2888	
2889	DUKE VINCENTIO	                  They will, then, ere't be long.
2890	
2891	Provost	What comfort is for Claudio?
2892	
2893	DUKE VINCENTIO	There's some in hope.
2894	
2895	Provost	It is a bitter deputy.
2896	
2897	DUKE VINCENTIO	Not so, not so; his life is parallel'd
2898	Even with the stroke and line of his great justice:
2899	He doth with holy abstinence subdue
2900	That in himself which he spurs on his power
2901	To qualify in others: were he meal'd with that
2902	Which he corrects, then were he tyrannous;
2903	But this being so, he's just.
2904	
2905	[Knocking within]
2906	
2907	Now are they come.
2908	
2909	[Exit Provost]
2910	
2911	This is a gentle provost: seldom when
2912	The steeled gaoler is the friend of men.
2913	
2914	[Knocking within]
2915	
2916	How now! what noise? That spirit's possessed with haste
2917	That wounds the unsisting postern with these strokes.
2918	
2919	[Re-enter Provost]
2920	
2921	Provost	There he must stay until the officer
2922	Arise to let him in: he is call'd up.
2923	
2924	DUKE VINCENTIO	Have you no countermand for Claudio yet,
2925	But he must die to-morrow?
2926	
2927	Provost	None, sir, none.
2928	
2929	DUKE VINCENTIO	As near the dawning, provost, as it is,
2930	You shall hear more ere morning.
2931	
2932	Provost	Happily
2933	You something know; yet I believe there comes
2934	No countermand; no such example have we:
2935	Besides, upon the very siege of justice
2936	Lord Angelo hath to the public ear
2937	Profess'd the contrary.
2938	
2939	[Enter a Messenger]
2940	
2941	This is his lordship's man.
2942	
2943	DUKE VINCENTIO	And here comes Claudio's pardon.
2944	
2945	Messenger	[Giving a paper]
2946	
2947	My lord hath sent you this note; and by me this
2948	further charge, that you swerve not from the
2949	smallest article of it, neither in time, matter, or
2950	other circumstance. Good morrow; for, as I take it,
2951	it is almost day.
2952	
2953	Provost	I shall obey him.
2954	
2955	[Exit Messenger]
2956	
2957	DUKE VINCENTIO	[Aside]  This is his pardon, purchased by such sin
2958	For which the pardoner himself is in.
2959	Hence hath offence his quick celerity,
2960	When it is born in high authority:
2961	When vice makes mercy, mercy's so extended,
2962	That for the fault's love is the offender friended.
2963	Now, sir, what news?
2964	
2965	Provost	I told you. Lord Angelo, belike thinking me remiss
2966	in mine office, awakens me with this unwonted
2967	putting-on; methinks strangely, for he hath not used it before.
2968	
2969	DUKE VINCENTIO	Pray you, let's hear.
2970	
2971	Provost	[Reads]
2972	
2973	'Whatsoever you may hear to the contrary, let
2974	Claudio be executed by four of the clock; and in the
2975	afternoon Barnardine: for my better satisfaction,
2976	let me have Claudio's head sent me by five. Let
2977	this be duly performed; with a thought that more
2978	depends on it than we must yet deliver. Thus fail
2979	not to do your office, as you will answer it at your peril.'
2980	What say you to this, sir?
2981	
2982	DUKE VINCENTIO	What is that Barnardine who is to be executed in the
2983	afternoon?
2984	
2985	Provost	A Bohemian born, but here nursed un and bred; one
2986	that is a prisoner nine years old.
2987	
2988	DUKE VINCENTIO	How came it that the absent duke had not either
2989	delivered him to his liberty or executed him? I
2990	have heard it was ever his manner to do so.
2991	
2992	Provost	His friends still wrought reprieves for him: and,
2993	indeed, his fact, till now in the government of Lord
2994	Angelo, came not to an undoubtful proof.
2995	
2996	DUKE VINCENTIO	It is now apparent?
2997	
2998	Provost	Most manifest, and not denied by himself.
2999	
3000	DUKE VINCENTIO	Hath he born himself penitently in prison? how
3001	seems he to be touched?
3002	
3003	Provost	A man that apprehends death no more dreadfully but
3004	as a drunken sleep; careless, reckless, and fearless
3005	of what's past, present, or to come; insensible of
3006	mortality, and desperately mortal.
3007	
3008	DUKE VINCENTIO	He wants advice.
3009	
3010	Provost	He will hear none: he hath evermore had the liberty
3011	of the prison; give him leave to escape hence, he
3012	would not: drunk many times a day, if not many days
3013	entirely drunk. We have very oft awaked him, as if
3014	to carry him to execution, and showed him a seeming
3015	warrant for it: it hath not moved him at all.
3016	
3017	DUKE VINCENTIO	More of him anon. There is written in your brow,
3018	provost, honesty and constancy: if I read it not
3019	truly, my ancient skill beguiles me; but, in the
3020	boldness of my cunning, I will lay myself in hazard.
3021	Claudio, whom here you have warrant to execute, is
3022	no greater forfeit to the law than Angelo who hath
3023	sentenced him. To make you understand this in a
3024	manifested effect, I crave but four days' respite;
3025	for the which you are to do me both a present and a
3026	dangerous courtesy.
3027	
3028	Provost	Pray, sir, in what?
3029	
3030	DUKE VINCENTIO	In the delaying death.
3031	
3032	Provost	A lack, how may I do it, having the hour limited,
3033	and an express command, under penalty, to deliver
3034	his head in the view of Angelo? I may make my case
3035	as Claudio's, to cross this in the smallest.
3036	
3037	DUKE VINCENTIO	By the vow of mine order I warrant you, if my
3038	instructions may be your guide. Let this Barnardine
3039	be this morning executed, and his head born to Angelo.
3040	
3041	Provost	Angelo hath seen them both, and will discover the favour.
3042	
3043	DUKE VINCENTIO	O, death's a great disguiser; and you may add to it.
3044	Shave the head, and tie the beard; and say it was
3045	the desire of the penitent to be so bared before his
3046	death: you know the course is common. If any thing
3047	fall to you upon this, more than thanks and good
3048	fortune, by the saint whom I profess, I will plead
3049	against it with my life.
3050	
3051	Provost	Pardon me, good father; it is against my oath.
3052	
3053	DUKE VINCENTIO	Were you sworn to the duke, or to the deputy?
3054	
3055	Provost	To him, and to his substitutes.
3056	
3057	DUKE VINCENTIO	You will think you have made no offence, if the duke
3058	avouch the justice of your dealing?
3059	
3060	Provost	But what likelihood is in that?
3061	
3062	DUKE VINCENTIO	Not a resemblance, but a certainty. Yet since I see
3063	you fearful, that neither my coat, integrity, nor
3064	persuasion can with ease attempt you, I will go
3065	further than I meant, to pluck all fears out of you.
3066	Look you, sir, here is the hand and seal of the
3067	duke: you know the character, I doubt not; and the
3068	signet is not strange to you.
3069	
3070	Provost	I know them both.
3071	
3072	DUKE VINCENTIO	The contents of this is the return of the duke: you
3073	shall anon over-read it at your pleasure; where you
3074	shall find, within these two days he will be here.
3075	This is a thing that Angelo knows not; for he this
3076	very day receives letters of strange tenor;
3077	perchance of the duke's death; perchance entering
3078	into some monastery; but, by chance, nothing of what
3079	is writ. Look, the unfolding star calls up the
3080	shepherd. Put not yourself into amazement how these
3081	things should be: all difficulties are but easy
3082	when they are known. Call your executioner, and off
3083	with Barnardine's head: I will give him a present
3084	shrift and advise him for a better place. Yet you
3085	are amazed; but this shall absolutely resolve you.
3086	Come away; it is almost clear dawn.

3099	SCENE III	Another room in the same.
3100	
3101	
3102	[Enter POMPEY]
3103	
3104	POMPEY	I am as well acquainted here as I was in our house
3105	of profession: one would think it were Mistress
3106	Overdone's own house, for here be many of her old
3107	customers. First, here's young Master Rash; he's in
3108	for a commodity of brown paper and old ginger,
3109	ninescore and seventeen pounds; of which he made
3110	five marks, ready money: marry, then ginger was not
3111	much in request, for the old women were all dead.
3112	Then is there here one Master Caper, at the suit of
3113	Master Three-pile the mercer, for some four suits of
3114	peach-coloured satin, which now peaches him a
3115	beggar. Then have we here young Dizy, and young
3116	Master Deep-vow, and Master Copperspur, and Master
3117	Starve-lackey the rapier and dagger man, and young
3118	Drop-heir that killed lusty Pudding, and Master
3119	Forthlight the tilter, and brave Master Shooty the
3120	great traveller, and wild Half-can that stabbed
3121	Pots, and, I think, forty more; all great doers in
3122	our trade, and are now 'for the Lord's sake.'
3123	
3124	[Enter ABHORSON]
3125	
3126	ABHORSON	Sirrah, bring Barnardine hither.
3127	
3128	POMPEY	Master Barnardine! you must rise and be hanged.
3129	Master Barnardine!
3130	
3131	ABHORSON	What, ho, Barnardine!
3132	
3133	BARNARDINE	[Within]  A pox o' your throats! Who makes that
3134	noise there? What are you?
3135	
3136	POMPEY	Your friends, sir; the hangman. You must be so
3137	good, sir, to rise and be put to death.
3138	
3139	BARNARDINE	[Within]  Away, you rogue, away! I am sleepy.
3140	
3141	ABHORSON	Tell him he must awake, and that quickly too.
3142	
3143	POMPEY	Pray, Master Barnardine, awake till you are
3144	executed, and sleep afterwards.
3145	
3146	ABHORSON	Go in to him, and fetch him out.
3147	
3148	POMPEY	He is coming, sir, he is coming; I hear his straw rustle.
3149	
3150	ABHORSON	Is the axe upon the block, sirrah?
3151	
3152	POMPEY	Very ready, sir.
3153	
3154	[Enter BARNARDINE]
3155	
3156	BARNARDINE	How now, Abhorson? what's the news with you?
3157	
3158	ABHORSON	Truly, sir, I would desire you to clap into your
3159	prayers; for, look you, the warrant's come.
3160	
3161	BARNARDINE	You rogue, I have been drinking all night; I am not
3162	fitted for 't.
3163	
3164	POMPEY	O, the better, sir; for he that drinks all night,
3165	and is hanged betimes in the morning, may sleep the
3166	sounder all the next day.
3167	
3168	ABHORSON	Look you, sir; here comes your ghostly father: do
3169	we jest now, think you?
3170	
3171	[Enter DUKE VINCENTIO disguised as before]
3172	
3173	DUKE VINCENTIO	Sir, induced by my charity, and hearing how hastily
3174	you are to depart, I am come to advise you, comfort
3175	you and pray with you.
3176	
3177	BARNARDINE	Friar, not I	I have been drinking hard all night,
3178	and I will have more time to prepare me, or they
3179	shall beat out my brains with billets: I will not
3180	consent to die this day, that's certain.
3181	
3182	DUKE VINCENTIO	O, sir, you must: and therefore I beseech you
3183	Look forward on the journey you shall go.
3184	
3185	BARNARDINE	I swear I will not die to-day for any man's

3188	DUKE VINCENTIO	But hear you.
3189	
3190	BARNARDINE	Not a word: if you have any thing to say to me,
3191	come to my ward; for thence will not I to-day.
3192	
3193	[Exit]
3194	
3195	DUKE VINCENTIO	Unfit to live or die: O gravel heart!
3196	After him, fellows; bring him to the block.

3198	[Exeunt ABHORSON and POMPEY]
3199	
3200	[Re-enter Provost]
3201	
3202	Provost	Now, sir, how do you find the prisoner?
3203	
3204	DUKE VINCENTIO	A creature unprepared, unmeet for death;
3205	And to transport him in the mind he is
3206	Were damnable.
3207	
3208	Provost	                  Here in the prison, father,
3209	There died this morning of a cruel fever
3210	One Ragozine, a most notorious pirate,
3211	A man of Claudio's years; his beard and head
3212	Just of his colour. What if we do omit
3213	This reprobate till he were well inclined;
3214	And satisfy the deputy with the visage
3215	Of Ragozine, more like to Claudio?
3216	
3217	DUKE VINCENTIO	O, 'tis an accident that heaven provides!
3218	Dispatch it presently; the hour draws on
3219	Prefix'd by Angelo: see this be done,
3220	And sent according to command; whiles I
3221	Persuade this rude wretch willingly to die.
3222	
3223	Provost	This shall be done, good father, presently.
3224	But Barnardine must die this afternoon:
3225	And how shall we continue Claudio,
3226	To save me from the danger that might come
3227	If he were known alive?
3228	
3229	DUKE VINCENTIO	Let this be done.
3230	Put them in secret holds, both Barnardine and Claudio:
3231	Ere twice the sun hath made his journal greeting
3232	To the under generation, you shall find
3233	Your safety manifested.
3234	
3235	Provost	I am your free dependant.
3236	
3237	DUKE VINCENTIO	Quick, dispatch, and send the head to Angelo.
3238	
3239	[Exit Provost]
3240	
3241	Now will I write letters to Angelo,--
3242	The provost, he shall bear them, whose contents
3243	Shall witness to him I am near at home,
3244	And that, by great injunctions, I am bound
3245	To enter publicly: him I'll desire
3246	To meet me at the consecrated fount
3247	A league below the city; and from thence,
3248	By cold gradation and well-balanced form,
3249	We shall proceed with Angelo.
3250	
3251	[Re-enter Provost]
3252	
3253	Provost	Here is the head; I'll carry it myself.
3254	
3255	DUKE VINCENTIO	Convenient is it. Make a swift return;
3256	For I would commune with you of such things
3257	That want no ear but yours.
3258	
3259	Provost	I'll make all speed.
3260

3262	
3263	ISABELLA	[Within]  Peace, ho, be here!
3264	
3265	DUKE VINCENTIO	The tongue of Isabel. She's come to know
3266	If yet her brother's pardon be come hither:
3267	But I will keep her ignorant of her good,
3268	To make her heavenly comforts of despair,
3269	When it is least expected.
3270	
3271	[Enter ISABELLA]
3272	
3273	ISABELLA	Ho, by your leave!
3274	
3275	DUKE VINCENTIO	Good morning to you, fair and gracious daughter.
3276	
3277	ISABELLA	The better, given me by so holy a man.
3278	Hath yet the deputy sent my brother's pardon?
3279	
3280	DUKE VINCENTIO	He hath released him, Isabel, from the world:
3281	His head is off and sent to Angelo.
3282	
3283	ISABELLA	Nay, but it is not so.
3284	
3285	DUKE VINCENTIO	It is no other: show your wisdom, daughter,
3286	In your close patience.
3287	
3288	ISABELLA	O, I will to him and pluck out his eyes!
3289	
3290	DUKE VINCENTIO	You shall not be admitted to his sight.
3291	
3292	ISABELLA	Unhappy Claudio! wretched Isabel!
3293	Injurious world! most damned Angelo!
3294	
3295	DUKE VINCENTIO	This nor hurts him nor profits you a jot;
3296	Forbear it therefore; give your cause to heaven.
3297	Mark what I say, which you shall find
3298	By every syllable a faithful verity:
3299	The duke comes home to-morrow; nay, dry your eyes;
3300	One of our convent, and his confessor,
3301	Gives me this instance: already he hath carried
3302	Notice to Escalus and Angelo,
3303	Who do prepare to meet him at the gates,
3304	There to give up their power. If you can, pace your wisdom
3305	In that good path that I would wish it go,
3306	And you shall have your bosom on this wretch,
3307	Grace of the duke, revenges to your heart,
3308	And general honour.
3309	
3310	ISABELLA	                  I am directed by you.
3311	
3312	DUKE VINCENTIO	This letter, then, to Friar Peter give;
3313	'Tis that he sent me of the duke's return:
3314	Say, by this token, I desire his company
3315	At Mariana's house to-night. Her cause and yours
3316	I'll perfect him withal, and he shall bring you
3317	Before the duke, and to the head of Angelo
3318	Accuse him home and home. For my poor self,
3319	I am combined by a sacred vow
3320	And shall be absent. Wend you with this letter:
3321	Command these fretting waters from your eyes
3322	With a light heart; trust not my holy order,
3323	If I pervert your course. Who's here?
3324	
3325	[Enter LUCIO]
3326	
3327	LUCIO	Good even. Friar, where's the provost?
3328	
3329	DUKE VINCENTIO	Not within, sir.
3330	
3331	LUCIO	O pretty Isabella, I am pale at mine heart to see
3332	thine eyes so red: thou must be patient. I am fain
3333	to dine and sup with water and bran; I dare not for
3334	my head fill my belly; one fruitful meal would set
3335	me to 't. But they say the duke will be here
3336	to-morrow. By my troth, Isabel, I loved thy brother:
3337	if the old fantastical duke of dark corners had been
3338	at home, he had lived.
3339	
3340	[Exit ISABELLA]
3341	
3342	DUKE VINCENTIO	Sir, the duke is marvellous little beholding to your
3343	reports; but the best is, he lives not in them.
3344	
3345	LUCIO	Friar, thou knowest not the duke so well as I do:
3346	he's a better woodman than thou takest him for.
3347	
3348	DUKE VINCENTIO	Well, you'll answer this one day. Fare ye well.
3349	
3350	LUCIO	Nay, tarry; I'll go along with thee
3351	I can tell thee pretty tales of the duke.
3352	
3353	DUKE VINCENTIO	You have told me too many of him already, sir, if
3354	they be true; if not true, none were enough.
3355	
3356	LUCIO	I was once before him for getting a wench with child.
3357	
3358	DUKE VINCENTIO	Did you such a thing?
3359	
3360	LUCIO	Yes, marry, did I	but I was fain to forswear it;
3361	they would else have married me to the rotten medlar.
3362	
3363	DUKE VINCENTIO	Sir, your company is fairer than honest. Rest you well.
3364	
3365	LUCIO	By my troth, I'll go with thee to the lane's end:
3366	if bawdy talk offend you, we'll have very little of
3367	it. Nay, friar, I am a kind of burr; I shall stick.

3382	
3383	[Enter ANGELO and ESCALUS]
3384	
3385	ESCALUS	Every letter he hath writ hath disvouched other.
3386	
3387	ANGELO	In most uneven and distracted manner. His actions
3388	show much like to madness: pray heaven his wisdom be
3389	not tainted! And why meet him at the gates, and
3390	redeliver our authorities there
3391	
3392	ESCALUS	I guess not.
3393	
3394	ANGELO	And why should we proclaim it in an hour before his
3395	entering, that if any crave redress of injustice,
3396	they should exhibit their petitions in the street?
3397	
3398	ESCALUS	He shows his reason for that: to have a dispatch of
3399	complaints, and to deliver us from devices
3400	hereafter, which shall then have no power to stand
3401	against us.
3402	
3403	ANGELO	Well, I beseech you, let it be proclaimed betimes
3404	i' the morn; I'll call you at your house: give
3405	notice to such men of sort and suit as are to meet
3406	him.
3407	
3408	ESCALUS	I shall, sir. Fare you well.
3409	
3410	ANGELO	Good night.
3411	
3412	[Exit ESCALUS]
3413	
3414	This deed unshapes me quite, makes me unpregnant
3415	And dull to all proceedings. A deflower'd maid!
3416	And by an eminent body that enforced
3417	The law against it! But that her tender shame
3418	Will not proclaim against her maiden loss,
3419	How might she tongue me! Yet reason dares her no;
3420	For my authority bears of a credent bulk,
3421	That no particular scandal once can touch
3422	But it confounds the breather. He should have lived,
3423	Save that riotous youth, with dangerous sense,
3424	Might in the times to come have ta'en revenge,
3425	By so receiving a dishonour'd life
3426	With ransom of such shame. Would yet he had lived!
3427	A lack, when once our grace we have forgot,
3428	Nothing goes right: we would, and we would not.

3529	
3530	DUKE VINCENTIO	My very worthy cousin, fairly met!
3531	Our old and faithful friend, we are glad to see you.
3532	
3533

3535	|  Happy return be to your royal grace!

3540	We have made inquiry of you; and we hear

3542	Cannot but yield you forth to public thanks,
3543	Forerunning more requital.
3544	
3545	ANGELO	You make my bonds still greater.
3546	
3547	DUKE VINCENTIO	O, your desert speaks loud; and I should wrong it,

3549	When it deserves, with characters of brass,
3550	A forted residence 'gainst the tooth of time
3551	And razure of oblivion. Give me your hand,
3552	And let the subject see, to make them know
3553	That outward courtesies would fain proclaim
3554	Favours that keep within. Come, Escalus,
3555	You must walk by us on our other hand;
3556	And good supporters are you.

3561	
3562	ISABELLA	Justice, O royal duke! Vail your regard
3563	Upon a wrong'd, I would fain have said, a maid!
3564	O worthy prince, dishonour not your eye
3565	By throwing it on any other object
3566	Till you have heard me in my true complaint
3567	And given me justice, justice, justice, justice!
3568	
3569	DUKE VINCENTIO	Relate your wrongs; in what? by whom? be brief.
3570	Here is Lord Angelo shall give you justice:
3571	Reveal yourself to him.
3572	
3573	ISABELLA	O worthy duke,
3574	You bid me seek redemption of the devil:
3575	Hear me yourself; for that which I must speak
3576	Must either punish me, not being believed,
3577	Or wring redress from you. Hear me, O hear me, here!
3578	
3579	ANGELO	My lord, her wits, I fear me, are not firm:
3580	She hath been a suitor to me for her brother
3581	Cut off by course of justice,--
3582	
3583	ISABELLA	By course of justice!
3584	
3585	ANGELO	And she will speak most bitterly and strange.
3586	
3587	ISABELLA	Most strange, but yet most truly, will I speak:
3588	That Angelo's forsworn; is it not strange?
3589	That Angelo's a murderer; is 't not strange?
3590	That Angelo is an adulterous thief,
3591	An hypocrite, a virgin-violator;
3592	Is it not strange and strange?
3593	
3594	DUKE VINCENTIO	Nay, it is ten times strange.
3595	
3596	ISABELLA	It is not truer he is Angelo
3597	Than this is all as true as it is strange:
3598	Nay, it is ten times true; for truth is truth
3599	To the end of reckoning.
3600	
3601	DUKE VINCENTIO	Away with her! Poor soul,
3602	She speaks this in the infirmity of sense.
3603	
3604	ISABELLA	O prince, I conjure thee, as thou believest
3605	There is another comfort than this world,
3606	That thou neglect me not, with that opinion
3607	That I am touch'd with madness! Make not impossible
3608	That which but seems unlike: 'tis not impossible
3609	But one, the wicked'st caitiff on the ground,
3610	May seem as shy, as grave, as just, as absolute
3611	As Angelo; even so may Angelo,
3612	In all his dressings, characts, titles, forms,
3613	Be an arch-villain; believe it, royal prince:
3614	If he be less, he's nothing; but he's more,
3615	Had I more name for badness.
3616	
3617	DUKE VINCENTIO	By mine honesty,
3618	If she be mad,--as I believe no other,--
3619	Her madness hath the oddest frame of sense,
3620	Such a dependency of thing on thing,
3621	As e'er I heard in madness.
3622	
3623	ISABELLA	O gracious duke,
3624	Harp not on that, nor do not banish reason
3625	For inequality; but let your reason serve
3626	To make the truth appear where it seems hid,
3627	And hide the false seems true.
3628	
3629	DUKE VINCENTIO	Many that are not mad
3630	Have, sure, more lack of reason. What would you say?
3631	
3632	ISABELLA	I am the sister of one Claudio,
3633	Condemn'd upon the act of fornication
3634	To lose his head; condemn'd by Angelo:
3635	I, in probation of a sisterhood,
3636	Was sent to by my brother; one Lucio
3637	As then the messenger,--
3638	
3639	LUCIO	That's I, an't like your grace:
3640	I came to her from Claudio, and desired her
3641	To try her gracious fortune with Lord Angelo
3642	For her poor brother's pardon.
3643	
3644	ISABELLA	That's he indeed.
3645	
3646	DUKE VINCENTIO	You were not bid to speak.
3647	
3648	LUCIO	No, my good lord;
3649	Nor wish'd to hold my peace.
3650	
3651	DUKE VINCENTIO	I wish you now, then;
3652	Pray you, take note of it: and when you have
3653	A business for yourself, pray heaven you then
3654	Be perfect.
3655	
3656	LUCIO	I warrant your honour.
3657	
3658	DUKE VINCENTIO	The warrants for yourself; take heed to't.
3659	
3660	ISABELLA	This gentleman told somewhat of my tale,--
3661	
3662	LUCIO	Right.
3663	
3664	DUKE VINCENTIO	It may be right; but you are i' the wrong
3665	To speak before your time. Proceed.
3666	
3667	ISABELLA	I went
3668	To this pernicious caitiff deputy,--
3669	
3670	DUKE VINCENTIO	That's somewhat madly spoken.
3671	
3672	ISABELLA	Pardon it;
3673	The phrase is to the matter.
3674	
3675	DUKE VINCENTIO	Mended again. The matter; proceed.
3676	
3677	ISABELLA	In brief, to set the needless process by,
3678	How I persuaded, how I pray'd, and kneel'd,
3679	How he refell'd me, and how I replied,--
3680	For this was of much length,--the vile conclusion
3681	I now begin with grief and shame to utter:
3682	He would not, but by gift of my chaste body
3683	To his concupiscible intemperate lust,
3684	Release my brother; and, after much debatement,
3685	My sisterly remorse confutes mine honour,
3686	And I did yield to him: but the next morn betimes,
3687	His purpose surfeiting, he sends a warrant
3688	For my poor brother's head.
3689	
3690	DUKE VINCENTIO	This is most likely!
3691	
3692	ISABELLA	O, that it were as like as it is true!
3693	
3694	DUKE VINCENTIO	By heaven, fond wretch, thou knowist not what thou speak'st,
3695	Or else thou art suborn'd against his honour
3696	In hateful practise. First, his integrity
3697	Stands without blemish. Next, it imports no reason
3698	That with such vehemency he should pursue
3699	Faults proper to himself: if he had so offended,
3700	He would have weigh'd thy brother by himself
3701	And not have cut him off. Some one hath set you on:
3702	Confess the truth, and say by whose advice
3703	Thou camest here to complain.
3704	
3705	ISABELLA	And is this all?
3706	Then, O you blessed ministers above,
3707	Keep me in patience, and with ripen'd time
3708	Unfold the evil which is here wrapt up
3709	In countenance! Heaven shield your grace from woe,
3710	As I, thus wrong'd, hence unbelieved go!
3711	
3712	DUKE VINCENTIO	I know you'ld fain be gone. An officer!
3713	To prison with her! Shall we thus permit
3714	A blasting and a scandalous breath to fall
3715	On him so near us? This needs must be a practise.
3716	Who knew of Your intent and coming hither?
3717	
3718	ISABELLA	One that I would were here, Friar Lodowick.
3719	
3720	DUKE VINCENTIO	A ghostly father, belike. Who knows that Lodowick?
3721	
3722	LUCIO	My lord, I know him; 'tis a meddling friar;
3723	I do not like the man: had he been lay, my lord
3724	For certain words he spake against your grace
3725	In your retirement, I had swinged him soundly.
3726	
3727	DUKE VINCENTIO	Words against me? this is a good friar, belike!
3728	And to set on this wretched woman here
3729	Against our substitute! Let this friar be found.
3730	
3731	LUCIO	But yesternight, my lord, she and that friar,
3732	I saw them at the prison: a saucy friar,
3733	A very scurvy fellow.
3734	
3735	FRIAR PETER	Blessed be your royal grace!
3736	I have stood by, my lord, and I have heard
3737	Your royal ear abused. First, hath this woman
3738	Most wrongfully accused your substitute,
3739	Who is as free from touch or soil with her
3740	As she from one ungot.
3741	
3742	DUKE VINCENTIO	We did believe no less.
3743	Know you that Friar Lodowick that she speaks of?
3744	
3745	FRIAR PETER	I know him for a man divine and holy;
3746	Not scurvy, nor a temporary meddler,
3747	As he's reported by this gentleman;
3748	And, on my trust, a man that never yet
3749	Did, as he vouches, misreport your grace.
3750	
3751	LUCIO	My lord, most villanously; believe it.
3752	
3753	FRIAR PETER	Well, he in time may come to clear himself;
3754	But at this instant he is sick my lord,
3755	Of a strange fever. Upon his mere request,
3756	Being come to knowledge that there was complaint
3757	Intended 'gainst Lord Angelo, came I hither,
3758	To speak, as from his mouth, what he doth know
3759	Is true and false; and what he with his oath
3760	And all probation will make up full clear,
3761	Whensoever he's convented. First, for this woman.
3762	To justify this worthy nobleman,
3763	So vulgarly and personally accused,
3764	Her shall you hear disproved to her eyes,
3765	Till she herself confess it.
3766	
3767	DUKE VINCENTIO	Good friar, let's hear it.
3768	
3769	[ISABELLA is carried off guarded; and MARIANA comes forward]
3770	
3771	Do you not smile at this, Lord Angelo?
3772	O heaven, the vanity of wretched fools!
3773	Give us some seats. Come, cousin Angelo;
3774	In this I'll be impartial; be you judge
3775	Of your own cause. Is this the witness, friar?
3776	First, let her show her face, and after speak.
3777	
3778	MARIANA	Pardon, my lord; I will not show my face
3779	Until my husband bid me.
3780	
3781	DUKE VINCENTIO	What, are you married?
3782	
3783	MARIANA	No, my lord.
3784	
3785	DUKE VINCENTIO	Are you a maid?
3786	
3787	MARIANA	No, my lord.
3788	
3789	DUKE VINCENTIO	A widow, then?
3790	
3791	MARIANA	Neither, my lord.
3792	
3793	DUKE VINCENTIO	Why, you are nothing then: neither maid, widow, nor wife?
3794	
3795	LUCIO	My lord, she may be a punk; for many of them are
3796	neither maid, widow, nor wife.
3797	
3798	DUKE VINCENTIO	Silence that fellow: I would he had some cause
3799	To prattle for himself.
3800	
3801	LUCIO	Well, my lord.
3802	
3803	MARIANA	My lord; I do confess I ne'er was married;
3804	And I confess besides I am no maid:
3805	I have known my husband; yet my husband
3806	Knows not that ever he knew me.
3807	
3808	LUCIO	He was drunk then, my lord: it can be no better.
3809	
3810	DUKE VINCENTIO	For the benefit of silence, would thou wert so too!
3811	
3812	LUCIO	Well, my lord.
3813	
3814	DUKE VINCENTIO	This is no witness for Lord Angelo.
3815	
3816	MARIANA	Now I come to't my lord
3817	She that accuses him of fornication,
3818	In self-same manner doth accuse my husband,
3819	And charges him my lord, with such a time
3820	When I'll depose I had him in mine arms
3821	With all the effect of love.
3822	
3823	ANGELO	Charges she more than me?
3824	
3825	MARIANA	Not that I know.
3826	
3827	DUKE VINCENTIO	No? you say your husband.
3828	
3829	MARIANA	Why, just, my lord, and that is Angelo,
3830	Who thinks he knows that he ne'er knew my body,
3831	But knows he thinks that he knows Isabel's.
3832	
3833	ANGELO	This is a strange abuse. Let's see thy face.
3834	
3835	MARIANA	My husband bids me; now I will unmask.
3836	
3837	[Unveiling]
3838	
3839	This is that face, thou cruel Angelo,
3840	Which once thou sworest was worth the looking on;
3841	This is the hand which, with a vow'd contract,
3842	Was fast belock'd in thine; this is the body
3843	That took away the match from Isabel,
3844	And did supply thee at thy garden-house
3845	In her imagined person.
3846	
3847	DUKE VINCENTIO	Know you this woman?
3848	
3849	LUCIO	Carnally, she says.
3850	
3851	DUKE VINCENTIO	Sirrah, no more!
3852	
3853	LUCIO	Enough, my lord.
3854	
3855	ANGELO	My lord, I must confess I know this woman:
3856	And five years since there was some speech of marriage
3857	Betwixt myself and her; which was broke off,
3858	Partly for that her promised proportions
3859	Came short of composition, but in chief
3860	For that her reputation was disvalued
3861	In levity: since which time of five years
3862	I never spake with her, saw her, nor heard from her,
3863	Upon my faith and honour.
3864	
3865	MARIANA	Noble prince,
3866	As there comes light from heaven and words from breath,
3867	As there is sense in truth and truth in virtue,
3868	I am affianced this man's wife as strongly
3869	As words could make up vows: and, my good lord,
3870	But Tuesday night last gone in's garden-house
3871	He knew me as a wife. As this is true,
3872	Let me in safety raise me from my knees
3873	Or else for ever be confixed here,
3874	A marble monument!
3875	
3876	ANGELO	                  I did but smile till now:
3877	Now, good my lord, give me the scope of justice
3878	My patience here is touch'd. I do perceive
3879	These poor informal women are no more
3880	But instruments of some more mightier member
3881	That sets them on: let me have way, my lord,
3882	To find this practise out.
3883	
3884	DUKE VINCENTIO	Ay, with my heart
3885	And punish them to your height of pleasure.
3886	Thou foolish friar, and thou pernicious woman,
3887	Compact with her that's gone, think'st thou thy oaths,
3888	Though they would swear down each particular saint,
3889	Were testimonies against his worth and credit
3890	That's seal'd in approbation? You, Lord Escalus,
3891	Sit with my cousin; lend him your kind pains
3892	To find out this abuse, whence 'tis derived.
3893	There is another friar that set them on;
3894	Let him be sent for.
3895	
3896	FRIAR PETER	Would he were here, my lord! for he indeed
3897	Hath set the women on to this complaint:
3898	Your provost knows the place where he abides
3899	And he may fetch him.
3900	
3901	DUKE VINCENTIO	Go do it instantly.
3902	
3903	[Exit Provost]
3904	
3905	And you, my noble and well-warranted cousin,
3906	Whom it concerns to hear this matter forth,
3907	Do with your injuries as seems you best,
3908	In any chastisement: I for a while will leave you;
3909	But stir not you till you have well determined
3910	Upon these slanderers.
3911	
3912	ESCALUS	My lord, we'll do it throughly.
3913	
3914	[Exit DUKE]
3915	
3916	Signior Lucio, did not you say you knew that
3917	Friar Lodowick to be a dishonest person?
3918	
3919	LUCIO	'Cucullus non facit monachum:' honest in nothing
3920	but in his clothes; and one that hath spoke most
3921	villanous speeches of the duke.
3922	
3923	ESCALUS	We shall entreat you to abide here till he come and
3924	enforce them against him: we shall find this friar a
3925	notable fellow.
3926	
3927	LUCIO	As any in Vienna, on my word.
3928	
3929	ESCALUS	Call that same Isabel here once again; I would speak with her.
3930	
3931	[Exit an Attendant]
3932	
3933	Pray you, my lord, give me leave to question; you
3934	shall see how I'll handle her.
3935	
3936	LUCIO	Not better than he, by her own report.
3937	
3938	ESCALUS	Say you?
3939	
3940	LUCIO	Marry, sir, I think, if you handled her privately,
3941	she would sooner confess: perchance, publicly,
3942	she'll be ashamed.
3943	
3944	ESCALUS	I will go darkly to work with her.
3945	
3946	LUCIO	That's the way; for women are light at midnight.
3947	
3948	[Re-enter Officers with ISABELLA; and Provost with
3949	the DUKE VINCENTIO in his friar's habit]
3950	
3951	ESCALUS	Come on, mistress: here's a gentlewoman denies all
3952	that you have said.
3953	
3954	LUCIO	My lord, here comes the rascal I spoke of; here with
3955	the provost.
3956	
3957	ESCALUS	In very good time: speak not you to him till we
3958	call upon you.
3959	
3960	LUCIO	Mum.
3961	
3962	ESCALUS	Come, sir: did you set these women on to slander
3963	Lord Angelo? they have confessed you did.
3964	
3965	DUKE VINCENTIO	'Tis false.
3966	
3967	ESCALUS	How! know you where you are?
3968	
3969	DUKE VINCENTIO	Respect to your great place! and let the devil
3970	Be sometime honour'd for his burning throne!
3971	Where is the duke? 'tis he should hear me speak.
3972	
3973	ESCALUS	The duke's in us; and we will hear you speak:
3974	Look you speak justly.
3975	
3976	DUKE VINCENTIO	Boldly, at least. But, O, poor souls,
3977	Come you to seek the lamb here of the fox?
3978	Good night to your redress! Is the duke gone?
3979	Then is your cause gone too. The duke's unjust,
3980	Thus to retort your manifest appeal,
3981	And put your trial in the villain's mouth
3982	Which here you come to accuse.
3983	
3984	LUCIO	This is the rascal; this is he I spoke of.
3985	
3986	ESCALUS	Why, thou unreverend and unhallow'd friar,
3987	Is't not enough thou hast suborn'd these women
3988	To accuse this worthy man, but, in foul mouth
3989	And in the witness of his proper ear,
3990	To call him villain? and then to glance from him
3991	To the duke himself, to tax him with injustice?
3992	Take him hence; to the rack with him! We'll touse you
3993	Joint by joint, but we will know his purpose.
3994	What 'unjust'!
3995	
3996	DUKE VINCENTIO	                  Be not so hot; the duke
3997	Dare no more stretch this finger of mine than he
3998	Dare rack his own: his subject am I not,
3999	Nor here provincial. My business in this state
4000	Made me a looker on here in Vienna,
4001	Where I have seen corruption boil and bubble
4002	Till it o'er-run the stew; laws for all faults,
4003	But faults so countenanced, that the strong statutes
4004	Stand like the forfeits in a barber's shop,
4005	As much in mock as mark.
4006	
4007	ESCALUS	Slander to the state! Away with him to prison!
4008	
4009	ANGELO	What can you vouch against him, Signior Lucio?
4010	Is this the man that you did tell us of?
4011	
4012	LUCIO	'Tis he, my lord. Come hither, goodman baldpate:
4013	do you know me?
4014	
4015	DUKE VINCENTIO	I remember you, sir, by the sound of your voice: I
4016	met you at the prison, in the absence of the duke.
4017	
4018	LUCIO	O, did you so? And do you remember what you said of the duke?
4019	
4020	DUKE VINCENTIO	Most notedly, sir.
4021	
4022	LUCIO	Do you so, sir? And was the duke a fleshmonger, a
4023	fool, and a coward, as you then reported him to be?
4024	
4025	DUKE VINCENTIO	You must, sir, change persons with me, ere you make
4026	that my report: you, indeed, spoke so of him; and
4027	much more, much worse.
4028	
4029	LUCIO	O thou damnable fellow! Did not I pluck thee by the
4030	nose for thy speeches?
4031	
4032	DUKE VINCENTIO	I protest I love the duke as I love myself.
4033	
4034	ANGELO	Hark, how the villain would close now, after his
4035	treasonable abuses!
4036	
4037	ESCALUS	Such a fellow is not to be talked withal. Away with
4038	him to prison! Where is the provost? Away with him
4039	to prison! lay bolts enough upon him: let him
4040	speak no more. Away with those giglots too, and
4041	with the other confederate companion!
4042	
4043	DUKE VINCENTIO	[To Provost]  Stay, sir; stay awhile.
4044	
4045	ANGELO	What, resists he? Help him, Lucio.
4046	
4047	LUCIO	Come, sir; come, sir; come, sir; foh, sir! Why, you
4048	bald-pated, lying rascal, you must be hooded, must
4049	you? Show your knave's visage, with a pox to you!
4050	show your sheep-biting face, and be hanged an hour!
4051	Will't not off?
4052	
4053	[Pulls off the friar's hood, and discovers DUKE
4054	VINCENTIO]
4055	
4056	DUKE VINCENTIO	Thou art the first knave that e'er madest a duke.
4057	First, provost, let me bail these gentle three.
4058	
4059	[To LUCIO]
4060	
4061	Sneak not away, sir; for the friar and you
4062	Must have a word anon. Lay hold on him.
4063	
4064	LUCIO	This may prove worse than hanging.
4065	
4066	DUKE VINCENTIO	[To ESCALUS]  What you have spoke I pardon: sit you down:
4067	We'll borrow place of him.
4068	
4069	[To ANGELO]
4070	
4071	Sir, by your leave.
4072	Hast thou or word, or wit, or impudence,
4073	That yet can do thee office? If thou hast,
4074	Rely upon it till my tale be heard,
4075	And hold no longer out.
4076	
4077	ANGELO	O my dread lord,
4078	I should be guiltier than my guiltiness,
4079	To think I can be undiscernible,
4080	When I perceive your grace, like power divine,
4081	Hath look'd upon my passes. Then, good prince,
4082	No longer session hold upon my shame,
4083	But let my trial be mine own confession:
4084	Immediate sentence then and sequent death
4085	Is all the grace I beg.
4086	
4087	DUKE VINCENTIO	Come hither, Mariana.
4088	Say, wast thou e'er contracted to this woman?
4089	
4090	ANGELO	I was, my lord.
4091	
4092	DUKE VINCENTIO	Go take her hence, and marry her instantly.
4093	Do you the office, friar; which consummate,
4094	Return him here again. Go with him, provost.
4095	
4096	[Exeunt ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER and Provost]
4097	
4098	ESCALUS	My lord, I am more amazed at his dishonour
4099	Than at the strangeness of it.
4100	
4101	DUKE VINCENTIO	Come hither, Isabel.
4102	Your friar is now your prince: as I was then
4103	Advertising and holy to your business,
4104	Not changing heart with habit, I am still
4105	Attorney'd at your service.
4106	
4107	ISABELLA	O, give me pardon,
4108	That I, your vassal, have employ'd and pain'd
4109	Your unknown sovereignty!
4110	
4111	DUKE VINCENTIO	You are pardon'd, Isabel:
4112	And now, dear maid, be you as free to us.
4113	Your brother's death, I know, sits at your heart;
4114	And you may marvel why I obscured myself,
4115	Labouring to save his life, and would not rather
4116	Make rash remonstrance of my hidden power
4117	Than let him so be lost. O most kind maid,
4118	It was the swift celerity of his death,
4119	Which I did think with slower foot came on,
4120	That brain'd my purpose. But, peace be with him!
4121	That life is better life, past fearing death,
4122	Than that which lives to fear: make it your comfort,
4123	So happy is your brother.
4124	
4125	ISABELLA	I do, my lord.
4126	
4127	[Re-enter ANGELO, MARIANA, FRIAR PETER, and Provost]
4128	
4129	DUKE VINCENTIO	For this new-married man approaching here,
4130	Whose salt imagination yet hath wrong'd
4131	Your well defended honour, you must pardon
4132	For Mariana's sake: but as he adjudged your brother,--
4133	Being criminal, in double violation
4134	Of sacred chastity and of promise-breach
4135	Thereon dependent, for your brother's life,--
4136	The very mercy of the law cries out
4137	Most audible, even from his proper tongue,
4138	'An Angelo for Claudio, death for death!'
4139	Haste still pays haste, and leisure answers leisure;
4140	Like doth quit like, and MEASURE still FOR MEASURE.
4141	Then, Angelo, thy fault's thus manifested;
4142	Which, though thou wouldst deny, denies thee vantage.
4143	We do condemn thee to the very block
4144	Where Claudio stoop'd to death, and with like haste.
4145	Away with him!
4146	
4147	MARIANA	                  O my most gracious lord,
4148	I hope you will not mock me with a husband.
4149	
4150	DUKE VINCENTIO	It is your husband mock'd you with a husband.
4151	Consenting to the safeguard of your honour,
4152	I thought your marriage fit; else imputation,
4153	For that he knew you, might reproach your life
4154	And choke your good to come; for his possessions,
4155	Although by confiscation they are ours,
4156	We do instate and widow you withal,
4157	To buy you a better husband.
4158	
4159	MARIANA	O my dear lord,
4160	I crave no other, nor no better man.
4161	
4162	DUKE VINCENTIO	Never crave him; we are definitive.
4163	
4164	MARIANA	Gentle my liege,--
4165	
4166	[Kneeling]
4167	
4168	DUKE VINCENTIO	                  You do but lose your labour.
4169	Away with him to death!
4170	
4171	[To LUCIO]
4172	
4173	Now, sir, to you.
4174	
4175	MARIANA	O my good lord! Sweet Isabel, take my part;
4176	Lend me your knees, and all my life to come
4177	I'll lend you all my life to do you service.
4178	
4179	DUKE VINCENTIO	Against all sense you do importune her:
4180	Should she kneel down in mercy of this fact,
4181	Her brother's ghost his paved bed would break,
4182	And take her hence in horror.
4183	
4184	MARIANA	Isabel,
4185	Sweet Isabel, do yet but kneel by me;
4186	Hold up your hands, say nothing; I'll speak all.
4187	They say, best men are moulded out of faults;
4188	And, for the most, become much more the better
4189	For being a little bad: so may my husband.
4190	O Isabel, will you not lend a knee?
4191	
4192	DUKE VINCENTIO	He dies for Claudio's death.
4193	
4194	ISABELLA	Most bounteous sir,
4195	
4196	[Kneeling]
4197	
4198	Look, if it please you, on this man condemn'd,
4199	As if my brother lived: I partly think
4200	A due sincerity govern'd his deeds,
4201	Till he did look on me: since it is so,
4202	Let him not die. My brother had but justice,
4203	In that he did the thing for which he died:
4204	For Angelo,
4205	His act did not o'ertake his bad intent,
4206	And must be buried but as an intent
4207	That perish'd by the way: thoughts are no subjects;
4208	Intents but merely thoughts.
4209	
4210	MARIANA	Merely, my lord.
4211	
4212	DUKE VINCENTIO	Your suit's unprofitable; stand up, I say.
4213	I have bethought me of another fault.
4214	Provost, how came it Claudio was beheaded
4215	At an unusual hour?
4216	
4217	Provost	It was commanded so.
4218	
4219	DUKE VINCENTIO	Had you a special warrant for the deed?
4220	
4221	Provost	No, my good lord; it was by private message.
4222	
4223	DUKE VINCENTIO	For which I do discharge you of your office:
4224	Give up your keys.
4225	
4226	Provost	                  Pardon me, noble lord:
4227	I thought it was a fault, but knew it not;
4228	Yet did repent me, after more advice;
4229	For testimony whereof, one in the prison,
4230	That should by private order else have died,
4231	I have reserved alive.
4232	
4233	DUKE VINCENTIO	What's he?
4234	
4235	Provost	His name is Barnardine.
4236	
4237	DUKE VINCENTIO	I would thou hadst done so by Claudio.
4238	Go fetch him hither; let me look upon him.
4239	
4240	[Exit Provost]
4241	
4242	ESCALUS	I am sorry, one so learned and so wise
4243	As you, Lord Angelo, have still appear'd,
4244	Should slip so grossly, both in the heat of blood.
4245	And lack of temper'd judgment afterward.
4246	
4247	ANGELO	I am sorry that such sorrow I procure:
4248	And so deep sticks it in my penitent heart
4249	That I crave death more willingly than mercy;
4250	'Tis my deserving, and I do entreat it.
4251	
4252	[Re-enter Provost, with BARNARDINE, CLAUDIO muffled,
4253	and JULIET]
4254	
4255	DUKE VINCENTIO	Which is that Barnardine?
4256	
4257	Provost	This, my lord.
4258	
4259	DUKE VINCENTIO	There was a friar told me of this man.
4260	Sirrah, thou art said to have a stubborn soul.
4261	That apprehends no further than this world,
4262	And squarest thy life according. Thou'rt condemn'd:
4263	But, for those earthly faults, I quit them all;
4264	And pray thee take this mercy to provide
4265	For better times to come. Friar, advise him;
4266	I leave him to your hand. What muffled fellow's that?
4267	
4268	Provost	This is another prisoner that I saved.
4269	Who should have died when Claudio lost his head;
4270	As like almost to Claudio as himself.
4271	
4272	[Unmuffles CLAUDIO]
4273	
4274	DUKE VINCENTIO	[To ISABELLA]  If he be like your brother, for his sake
4275	Is he pardon'd; and, for your lovely sake,
4276	Give me your hand and say you will be mine.
4277	He is my brother too: but fitter time for that.
4278	By this Lord Angelo perceives he's safe;
4279	Methinks I see a quickening in his eye.
4280	Well, Angelo, your evil quits you well:
4281	Look that you love your wife; her worth worth yours.
4282	I find an apt remission in myself;
4283	And yet here's one in place I cannot pardon.
4284	
4285	[To LUCIO]
4286	
4287	You, sirrah, that knew me for a fool, a coward,
4288	One all of luxury, an ass, a madman;
4289	Wherein have I so deserved of you,
4290	That you extol me thus?
4291	
4292	LUCIO	'Faith, my lord. I spoke it but according to the
4293	trick. If you will hang me for it, you may; but I
4294	had rather it would please you I might be whipt.
4295	
4296	DUKE VINCENTIO	Whipt first, sir, and hanged after.
4297	Proclaim it, provost, round about the city.
4298	Is any woman wrong'd by this lewd fellow,
4299	As I have heard him swear himself there's one
4300	Whom he begot with child, let her appear,
4301	And he shall marry her: the nuptial finish'd,
4302	Let him be whipt and hang'd.
4303	
4304	LUCIO	I beseech your highness, do not marry me to a whore.
4305	Your highness said even now, I made you a duke:
4306	good my lord, do not recompense me in making me a cuckold.
4307	
4308	DUKE VINCENTIO	Upon mine honour, thou shalt marry her.
4309	Thy slanders I forgive; and therewithal
4310	Remit thy other forfeits. Take him to prison;
4311	And see our pleasure herein executed.
4312	
4313	LUCIO	Marrying a punk, my lord, is pressing to death,
4314	whipping, and hanging.
4315	
4316	DUKE VINCENTIO	Slandering a prince deserves it.
4317	
4318	[Exit Officers with LUCIO]
4319	
4320	She, Claudio, that you wrong'd, look you restore.
4321	Joy to you, Mariana! Love her, Angelo:
4322	I have confess'd her and I know her virtue.
4323	Thanks, good friend Escalus, for thy much goodness:
4324	There's more behind that is more gratulate.
4325	Thanks, provost, for thy care and secrecy:
4326	We shill employ thee in a worthier place.
4327	Forgive him, Angelo, that brought you home
4328	The head of Ragozine for Claudio's:
4329	The offence pardons itself. Dear Isabel,
4330	I have a motion much imports your good;
4331	Whereto if you'll a willing ear incline,
4332	What's mine is yours and what is yours is mine.
4333	So, bring us to our palace; where we'll show
4334	What's yet behind, that's meet you all should know.
4335	
4336	[Exeunt]

83	SCENE I	London. The palace.
84	
85	
86	[Enter KING HENRY, LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER, the EARL
87	of WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT, and others]
88	
89	KING HENRY IV	So shaken as we are, so wan with care,
90	Find we a time for frighted peace to pant,
91	And breathe short-winded accents of new broils
92	To be commenced in strands afar remote.
93	No more the thirsty entrance of this soil
94	Shall daub her lips with her own children's blood;
95	Nor more shall trenching war channel her fields,
96	Nor bruise her flowerets with the armed hoofs
97	Of hostile paces: those opposed eyes,
98	Which, like the meteors of a troubled heaven,
99	All of one nature, of one substance bred,
100	Did lately meet in the intestine shock
101	And furious close of civil butchery
102	Shall now, in mutual well-beseeming ranks,
103	March all one way and be no more opposed
104	Against acquaintance, kindred and allies:
105	The edge of war, like an ill-sheathed knife,
106	No more shall cut his master. Therefore, friends,
107	As far as to the sepulchre of Christ,
108	Whose soldier now, under whose blessed cross
109	We are impressed and engaged to fight,
110	Forthwith a power of English shall we levy;
111	Whose arms were moulded in their mothers' womb
112	To chase these pagans in those holy fields
113	Over whose acres walk'd those blessed feet
114	Which fourteen hundred years ago were nail'd
115	For our advantage on the bitter cross.
116	But this our purpose now is twelve month old,
117	And bootless 'tis to tell you we will go:
118	Therefore we meet not now. Then let me hear
119	Of you, my gentle cousin Westmoreland,
120	What yesternight our council did decree
121	In forwarding this dear expedience.
122	
123	WESTMORELAND	My liege, this haste was hot in question,
124	And many limits of the charge set down
125	But yesternight: when all athwart there came
126	A post from Wales loaden with heavy news;
127	Whose worst was, that the noble Mortimer,
128	Leading the men of Herefordshire to fight
129	Against the irregular and wild Glendower,
130	Was by the rude hands of that Welshman taken,
131	A thousand of his people butchered;
132	Upon whose dead corpse there was such misuse,
133	Such beastly shameless transformation,
134	By those Welshwomen done as may not be
135	Without much shame retold or spoken of.
136	
137	KING HENRY IV	It seems then that the tidings of this broil
138	Brake off our business for the Holy Land.
139	
140	WESTMORELAND	This match'd with other did, my gracious lord;
141	For more uneven and unwelcome news
142	Came from the north and thus it did import:
143	On Holy-rood day, the gallant Hotspur there,
144	Young Harry Percy and brave Archibald,
145	That ever-valiant and approved Scot,
146	At Holmedon met,
147	Where they did spend a sad and bloody hour,
148	As by discharge of their artillery,
149	And shape of likelihood, the news was told;
150	For he that brought them, in the very heat
151	And pride of their contention did take horse,
152	Uncertain of the issue any way.
153	
154	KING HENRY IV	Here is a dear, a true industrious friend,
155	Sir Walter Blunt, new lighted from his horse.
156	Stain'd with the variation of each soil
157	Betwixt that Holmedon and this seat of ours;
158	And he hath brought us smooth and welcome news.
159	The Earl of Douglas is discomfited:
160	Ten thousand bold Scots, two and twenty knights,
161	Balk'd in their own blood did Sir Walter see
162	On Holmedon's plains. Of prisoners, Hotspur took
163	Mordake the Earl of Fife, and eldest son
164	To beaten Douglas; and the Earl of Athol,
165	Of Murray, Angus, and Menteith:
166	And is not this an honourable spoil?
167	A gallant prize? ha, cousin, is it not?
168	
169	WESTMORELAND	In faith,
170	It is a conquest for a prince to boast of.
171	
172	KING HENRY IV	Yea, there thou makest me sad and makest me sin
173	In envy that my Lord Northumberland
174	Should be the father to so blest a son,
175	A son who is the theme of honour's tongue;
176	Amongst a grove, the very straightest plant;
177	Who is sweet Fortune's minion and her pride:
178	Whilst I, by looking on the praise of him,
179	See riot and dishonour stain the brow
180	Of my young Harry. O that it could be proved
181	That some night-tripping fairy had exchanged
182	In cradle-clothes our children where they lay,
183	And call'd mine Percy, his Plantagenet!
184	Then would I have his Harry, and he mine.
185	But let him from my thoughts. What think you, coz,
186	Of this young Percy's pride? the prisoners,
187	Which he in this adventure hath surprised,
188	To his own use he keeps; and sends me word,
189	I shall have none but Mordake Earl of Fife.
190	
191	WESTMORELAND	This is his uncle's teaching; this is Worcester,
192	Malevolent to you in all aspects;
193	Which makes him prune himself, and bristle up
194	The crest of youth against your dignity.
195	
196	KING HENRY IV	But I have sent for him to answer this;
197	And for this cause awhile we must neglect
198	Our holy purpose to Jerusalem.
199	Cousin, on Wednesday next our council we
200	Will hold at Windsor; so inform the lords:
201	But come yourself with speed to us again;
202	For more is to be said and to be done
203	Than out of anger can be uttered.
204	
205	WESTMORELAND	I will, my liege.

213	
214	
215	ACT I
216	
217	
218	
219	SCENE II	London. An apartment of the Prince's.
220	
221	
222	[Enter the PRINCE OF WALES and FALSTAFF]
223	
224	FALSTAFF	Now, Hal, what time of day is it, lad?
225	
226	PRINCE HENRY	Thou art so fat-witted, with drinking of old sack
227	and unbuttoning thee after supper and sleeping upon
228	benches after noon, that thou hast forgotten to
229	demand that truly which thou wouldst truly know.
230	What a devil hast thou to do with the time of the
231	day? Unless hours were cups of sack and minutes
232	capons and clocks the tongues of bawds and dials the
233	signs of leaping-houses and the blessed sun himself
234	a fair hot wench in flame-coloured taffeta, I see no
235	reason why thou shouldst be so superfluous to demand
236	the time of the day.
237	
238	FALSTAFF	Indeed, you come near me now, Hal; for we that take
239	purses go by the moon and the seven stars, and not
240	by Phoebus, he,'that wandering knight so fair.' And,
241	I prithee, sweet wag, when thou art king, as, God
242	save thy grace,--majesty I should say, for grace
243	thou wilt have none,--
244	
245	PRINCE HENRY	What, none?
246	
247	FALSTAFF	No, by my troth, not so much as will serve to
248	prologue to an egg and butter.
249	
250	PRINCE HENRY	Well, how then? come, roundly, roundly.
251	
252	FALSTAFF	Marry, then, sweet wag, when thou art king, let not
253	us that are squires of the night's body be called
254	thieves of the day's beauty: let us be Diana's
255	foresters, gentlemen of the shade, minions of the
256	moon; and let men say we be men of good government,
257	being governed, as the sea is, by our noble and
258	chaste mistress the moon, under whose countenance we steal.
259	
260	PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest well, and it holds well too; for the
261	fortune of us that are the moon's men doth ebb and
262	flow like the sea, being governed, as the sea is,
263	by the moon. As, for proof, now: a purse of gold
264	most resolutely snatched on Monday night and most
265	dissolutely spent on Tuesday morning; got with
266	swearing 'Lay by' and spent with crying 'Bring in;'
267	now in as low an ebb as the foot of the ladder
268	and by and by in as high a flow as the ridge of the gallows.
269	
270	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, thou sayest true, lad. And is not my
271	hostess of the tavern a most sweet wench?
272	
273	PRINCE HENRY	As the honey of Hybla, my old lad of the castle. And
274	is not a buff jerkin a most sweet robe of durance?
275	
276	FALSTAFF	How now, how now, mad wag! what, in thy quips and
277	thy quiddities? what a plague have I to do with a
278	buff jerkin?
279	
280	PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a pox have I to do with my hostess of the tavern?
281	
282	FALSTAFF	Well, thou hast called her to a reckoning many a
283	time and oft.
284	
285	PRINCE HENRY	Did I ever call for thee to pay thy part?
286	
287	FALSTAFF	No; I'll give thee thy due, thou hast paid all there.
288	
289	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and elsewhere, so far as my coin would stretch;
290	and where it would not, I have used my credit.
291	
292	FALSTAFF	Yea, and so used it that were it not here apparent
293	that thou art heir apparent--But, I prithee, sweet
294	wag, shall there be gallows standing in England when
295	thou art king? and resolution thus fobbed as it is
296	with the rusty curb of old father antic the law? Do
297	not thou, when thou art king, hang a thief.
298	
299	PRINCE HENRY	No; thou shalt.
300	
301	FALSTAFF	Shall I? O rare! By the Lord, I'll be a brave judge.
302	
303	PRINCE HENRY	Thou judgest false already: I mean, thou shalt have
304	the hanging of the thieves and so become a rare hangman.
305	
306	FALSTAFF	Well, Hal, well; and in some sort it jumps with my
307	humour as well as waiting in the court, I can tell
308	you.
309	
310	PRINCE HENRY	For obtaining of suits?
311	
312	FALSTAFF	Yea, for obtaining of suits, whereof the hangman
313	hath no lean wardrobe. 'Sblood, I am as melancholy
314	as a gib cat or a lugged bear.
315	
316	PRINCE HENRY	Or an old lion, or a lover's lute.
317	
318	FALSTAFF	Yea, or the drone of a Lincolnshire bagpipe.
319	
320	PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou to a hare, or the melancholy of
321	Moor-ditch?
322	
323	FALSTAFF	Thou hast the most unsavoury similes and art indeed
324	the most comparative, rascalliest, sweet young
325	prince. But, Hal, I prithee, trouble me no more
326	with vanity. I would to God thou and I knew where a
327	commodity of good names were to be bought. An old
328	lord of the council rated me the other day in the
329	street about you, sir, but I marked him not; and yet
330	he talked very wisely, but I regarded him not; and
331	yet he talked wisely, and in the street too.
332	
333	PRINCE HENRY	Thou didst well; for wisdom cries out in the
334	streets, and no man regards it.
335	
336	FALSTAFF	O, thou hast damnable iteration and art indeed able
337	to corrupt a saint. Thou hast done much harm upon
338	me, Hal; God forgive thee for it! Before I knew
339	thee, Hal, I knew nothing; and now am I, if a man
340	should speak truly, little better than one of the
341	wicked. I must give over this life, and I will give
342	it over: by the Lord, and I do not, I am a villain:
343	I'll be damned for never a king's son in
344	Christendom.
345	
346	PRINCE HENRY	Where shall we take a purse tomorrow, Jack?
347	
348	FALSTAFF	'Zounds, where thou wilt, lad; I'll make one; an I
349	do not, call me villain and baffle me.
350	
351	PRINCE HENRY	I see a good amendment of life in thee; from praying
352	to purse-taking.
353	
354	FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, 'tis my vocation, Hal; 'tis no sin for a
355	man to labour in his vocation.
356	
357	[Enter POINS]
358	
359	Poins! Now shall we know if Gadshill have set a
360	match. O, if men were to be saved by merit, what
361	hole in hell were hot enough for him? This is the
362	most omnipotent villain that ever cried 'Stand' to
363	a true man.
364	
365	PRINCE HENRY	Good morrow, Ned.
366	
367	POINS	Good morrow, sweet Hal. What says Monsieur Remorse?
368	what says Sir John Sack and Sugar? Jack! how
369	agrees the devil and thee about thy soul, that thou
370	soldest him on Good-Friday last for a cup of Madeira
371	and a cold capon's leg?
372	
373	PRINCE HENRY	Sir John stands to his word, the devil shall have
374	his bargain; for he was never yet a breaker of
375	proverbs: he will give the devil his due.
376	
377	POINS	Then art thou damned for keeping thy word with the devil.
378	
379	PRINCE HENRY	Else he had been damned for cozening the devil.
380	
381	POINS	But, my lads, my lads, to-morrow morning, by four
382	o'clock, early at Gadshill! there are pilgrims going
383	to Canterbury with rich offerings, and traders
384	riding to London with fat purses: I have vizards
385	for you all; you have horses for yourselves:
386	Gadshill lies to-night in Rochester: I have bespoke
387	supper to-morrow night in Eastcheap: we may do it
388	as secure as sleep. If you will go, I will stuff
389	your purses full of crowns; if you will not, tarry
390	at home and be hanged.
391	
392	FALSTAFF	Hear ye, Yedward; if I tarry at home and go not,
393	I'll hang you for going.
394	
395	POINS	You will, chops?
396	
397	FALSTAFF	Hal, wilt thou make one?
398	
399	PRINCE HENRY	Who, I rob? I a thief? not I, by my faith.
400	
401	FALSTAFF	There's neither honesty, manhood, nor good
402	fellowship in thee, nor thou camest not of the blood
403	royal, if thou darest not stand for ten shillings.
404	
405	PRINCE HENRY	Well then, once in my days I'll be a madcap.
406	
407	FALSTAFF	Why, that's well said.
408	
409	PRINCE HENRY	Well, come what will, I'll tarry at home.
410	
411	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I'll be a traitor then, when thou art king.
412	
413	PRINCE HENRY	I care not.
414	
415	POINS	Sir John, I prithee, leave the prince and me alone:
416	I will lay him down such reasons for this adventure
417	that he shall go.
418	
419	FALSTAFF	Well, God give thee the spirit of persuasion and him
420	the ears of profiting, that what thou speakest may
421	move and what he hears may be believed, that the
422	true prince may, for recreation sake, prove a false
423	thief; for the poor abuses of the time want
424	countenance. Farewell: you shall find me in Eastcheap.
425	
426	PRINCE HENRY	Farewell, thou latter spring! farewell, All-hallown summer!
427	
428	[Exit Falstaff]
429	
430	POINS	Now, my good sweet honey lord, ride with us
431	to-morrow: I have a jest to execute that I cannot
432	manage alone. Falstaff, Bardolph, Peto and Gadshill
433	shall rob those men that we have already waylaid:
434	yourself and I will not be there; and when they
435	have the booty, if you and I do not rob them, cut
436	this head off from my shoulders.
437	
438	PRINCE HENRY	How shall we part with them in setting forth?
439	
440	POINS	Why, we will set forth before or after them, and
441	appoint them a place of meeting, wherein it is at
442	our pleasure to fail, and then will they adventure
443	upon the exploit themselves; which they shall have
444	no sooner achieved, but we'll set upon them.
445	
446	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but 'tis like that they will know us by our
447	horses, by our habits and by every other
448	appointment, to be ourselves.
449	
450	POINS	Tut! our horses they shall not see: I'll tie them
451	in the wood; our vizards we will change after we
452	leave them: and, sirrah, I have cases of buckram
453	for the nonce, to immask our noted outward garments.
454	
455	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, but I doubt they will be too hard for us.
456	
457	POINS	Well, for two of them, I know them to be as
458	true-bred cowards as ever turned back; and for the
459	third, if he fight longer than he sees reason, I'll
460	forswear arms. The virtue of this jest will be, the
461	incomprehensible lies that this same fat rogue will
462	tell us when we meet at supper: how thirty, at
463	least, he fought with; what wards, what blows, what
464	extremities he endured; and in the reproof of this
465	lies the jest.
466	
467	PRINCE HENRY	Well, I'll go with thee: provide us all things
468	necessary and meet me to-morrow night in Eastcheap;
469	there I'll sup. Farewell.
470	
471	POINS	Farewell, my lord.
472	
473	[Exit Poins]
474	
475	PRINCE HENRY	I know you all, and will awhile uphold
476	The unyoked humour of your idleness:
477	Yet herein will I imitate the sun,
478	Who doth permit the base contagious clouds
479	To smother up his beauty from the world,
480	That, when he please again to be himself,
481	Being wanted, he may be more wonder'd at,
482	By breaking through the foul and ugly mists
483	Of vapours that did seem to strangle him.
484	If all the year were playing holidays,
485	To sport would be as tedious as to work;
486	But when they seldom come, they wish'd for come,
487	And nothing pleaseth but rare accidents.
488	So, when this loose behavior I throw off
489	And pay the debt I never promised,
490	By how much better than my word I am,
491	By so much shall I falsify men's hopes;
492	And like bright metal on a sullen ground,
493	My reformation, glittering o'er my fault,
494	Shall show more goodly and attract more eyes
495	Than that which hath no foil to set it off.
496	I'll so offend, to make offence a skill;
497	Redeeming time when men think least I will.

505	
506	
507	ACT I
508	
509	
510	
511	SCENE III	London. The palace.
512	
513	
514	[Enter the KING, NORTHUMBERLAND, WORCESTER, HOTSPUR,
515	SIR WALTER BLUNT, with others]
516	
517	KING HENRY IV	My blood hath been too cold and temperate,
518	Unapt to stir at these indignities,
519	And you have found me; for accordingly
520	You tread upon my patience: but be sure
521	I will from henceforth rather be myself,
522	Mighty and to be fear'd, than my condition;
523	Which hath been smooth as oil, soft as young down,
524	And therefore lost that title of respect
525	Which the proud soul ne'er pays but to the proud.
526	
527	EARL OF WORCESTER	Our house, my sovereign liege, little deserves
528	The scourge of greatness to be used on it;
529	And that same greatness too which our own hands
530	Have holp to make so portly.
531	
532	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord.--
533	
534	KING HENRY IV	Worcester, get thee gone; for I do see
535	Danger and disobedience in thine eye:
536	O, sir, your presence is too bold and peremptory,
537	And majesty might never yet endure
538	The moody frontier of a servant brow.
539	You have good leave to leave us: when we need
540	Your use and counsel, we shall send for you.
541	
542	[Exit Worcester]
543	
544	You were about to speak.
545	
546	[To North]
547	
548	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, my good lord.
549	Those prisoners in your highness' name demanded,
550	Which Harry Percy here at Holmedon took,
551	Were, as he says, not with such strength denied
552	As is deliver'd to your majesty:
553	Either envy, therefore, or misprison
554	Is guilty of this fault and not my son.
555	
556	HOTSPUR	My liege, I did deny no prisoners.
557	But I remember, when the fight was done,
558	When I was dry with rage and extreme toil,
559	Breathless and faint, leaning upon my sword,
560	Came there a certain lord, neat, and trimly dress'd,
561	Fresh as a bridegroom; and his chin new reap'd
562	Show'd like a stubble-land at harvest-home;
563	He was perfumed like a milliner;
564	And 'twixt his finger and his thumb he held
565	A pouncet-box, which ever and anon
566	He gave his nose and took't away again;
567	Who therewith angry, when it next came there,
568	Took it in snuff; and still he smiled and talk'd,
569	And as the soldiers bore dead bodies by,
570	He call'd them untaught knaves, unmannerly,
571	To bring a slovenly unhandsome corse
572	Betwixt the wind and his nobility.
573	With many holiday and lady terms
574	He question'd me; amongst the rest, demanded
575	My prisoners in your majesty's behalf.
576	I then, all smarting with my wounds being cold,
577	To be so pester'd with a popinjay,
578	Out of my grief and my impatience,
579	Answer'd neglectingly I know not what,
580	He should or he should not; for he made me mad
581	To see him shine so brisk and smell so sweet
582	And talk so like a waiting-gentlewoman
583	Of guns and drums and wounds,--God save the mark!--
584	And telling me the sovereign'st thing on earth
585	Was parmaceti for an inward bruise;
586	And that it was great pity, so it was,
587	This villanous salt-petre should be digg'd
588	Out of the bowels of the harmless earth,
589	Which many a good tall fellow had destroy'd
590	So cowardly; and but for these vile guns,
591	He would himself have been a soldier.
592	This bald unjointed chat of his, my lord,
593	I answer'd indirectly, as I said;
594	And I beseech you, let not his report
595	Come current for an accusation
596	Betwixt my love and your high majesty.
597	
598	SIR WALTER BLUNT	The circumstance consider'd, good my lord,
599	Whate'er Lord Harry Percy then had said
600	To such a person and in such a place,
601	At such a time, with all the rest retold,
602	May reasonably die and never rise
603	To do him wrong or any way impeach
604	What then he said, so he unsay it now.
605	
606	KING HENRY IV	Why, yet he doth deny his prisoners,
607	But with proviso and exception,
608	That we at our own charge shall ransom straight
609	His brother-in-law, the foolish Mortimer;
610	Who, on my soul, hath wilfully betray'd
611	The lives of those that he did lead to fight
612	Against that great magician, damn'd Glendower,
613	Whose daughter, as we hear, the Earl of March
614	Hath lately married. Shall our coffers, then,
615	Be emptied to redeem a traitor home?
616	Shall we but treason? and indent with fears,
617	When they have lost and forfeited themselves?
618	No, on the barren mountains let him starve;
619	For I shall never hold that man my friend
620	Whose tongue shall ask me for one penny cost
621	To ransom home revolted Mortimer.
622	
623	HOTSPUR	Revolted Mortimer!
624	He never did fall off, my sovereign liege,
625	But by the chance of war; to prove that true
626	Needs no more but one tongue for all those wounds,
627	Those mouthed wounds, which valiantly he took
628	When on the gentle Severn's sedgy bank,
629	In single opposition, hand to hand,
630	He did confound the best part of an hour
631	In changing hardiment with great Glendower:
632	Three times they breathed and three times did
633	they drink,
634	Upon agreement, of swift Severn's flood;
635	Who then, affrighted with their bloody looks,
636	Ran fearfully among the trembling reeds,
637	And hid his crisp head in the hollow bank,
638	Bloodstained with these valiant combatants.
639	Never did base and rotten policy
640	Colour her working with such deadly wounds;
641	Nor could the noble Mortimer
642	Receive so many, and all willingly:
643	Then let not him be slander'd with revolt.
644	
645	KING HENRY IV	Thou dost belie him, Percy, thou dost belie him;
646	He never did encounter with Glendower:
647	I tell thee,
648	He durst as well have met the devil alone
649	As Owen Glendower for an enemy.
650	Art thou not ashamed? But, sirrah, henceforth
651	Let me not hear you speak of Mortimer:
652	Send me your prisoners with the speediest means,
653	Or you shall hear in such a kind from me
654	As will displease you. My Lord Northumberland,
655	We licence your departure with your son.
656	Send us your prisoners, or you will hear of it.
657	
658	[Exeunt King Henry, Blunt, and train]
659	
660	HOTSPUR	An if the devil come and roar for them,
661	I will not send them: I will after straight
662	And tell him so; for I will ease my heart,
663	Albeit I make a hazard of my head.
664	
665	NORTHUMBERLAND	What, drunk with choler? stay and pause awhile:
666	Here comes your uncle.
667	
668	[Re-enter WORCESTER]
669	
670	HOTSPUR	Speak of Mortimer!
671	'Zounds, I will speak of him; and let my soul
672	Want mercy, if I do not join with him:
673	Yea, on his part I'll empty all these veins,
674	And shed my dear blood drop by drop in the dust,
675	But I will lift the down-trod Mortimer
676	As high in the air as this unthankful king,
677	As this ingrate and canker'd Bolingbroke.
678	
679	NORTHUMBERLAND	Brother, the king hath made your nephew mad.
680	
681	EARL OF WORCESTER	Who struck this heat up after I was gone?
682	
683	HOTSPUR	He will, forsooth, have all my prisoners;
684	And when I urged the ransom once again
685	Of my wife's brother, then his cheek look'd pale,
686	And on my face he turn'd an eye of death,
687	Trembling even at the name of Mortimer.
688	
689	EARL OF WORCESTER	I cannot blame him: was not he proclaim'd
690	By Richard that dead is the next of blood?
691	
692	NORTHUMBERLAND	He was; I heard the proclamation:
693	And then it was when the unhappy king,
694	--Whose wrongs in us God pardon!--did set forth
695	Upon his Irish expedition;
696	From whence he intercepted did return
697	To be deposed and shortly murdered.
698	
699	EARL OF WORCESTER	And for whose death we in the world's wide mouth
700	Live scandalized and foully spoken of.
701	
702	HOTSPUR	But soft, I pray you; did King Richard then
703	Proclaim my brother Edmund Mortimer
704	Heir to the crown?
705	
706	NORTHUMBERLAND	He did; myself did hear it.
707	
708	HOTSPUR	Nay, then I cannot blame his cousin king,
709	That wished him on the barren mountains starve.
710	But shall it be that you, that set the crown
711	Upon the head of this forgetful man
712	And for his sake wear the detested blot
713	Of murderous subornation, shall it be,
714	That you a world of curses undergo,
715	Being the agents, or base second means,
716	The cords, the ladder, or the hangman rather?
717	O, pardon me that I descend so low,
718	To show the line and the predicament
719	Wherein you range under this subtle king;
720	Shall it for shame be spoken in these days,
721	Or fill up chronicles in time to come,
722	That men of your nobility and power
723	Did gage them both in an unjust behalf,
724	As both of you--God pardon it!--have done,
725	To put down Richard, that sweet lovely rose,
726	An plant this thorn, this canker, Bolingbroke?
727	And shall it in more shame be further spoken,
728	That you are fool'd, discarded and shook off
729	By him for whom these shames ye underwent?
730	No; yet time serves wherein you may redeem
731	Your banish'd honours and restore yourselves
732	Into the good thoughts of the world again,
733	Revenge the jeering and disdain'd contempt
734	Of this proud king, who studies day and night
735	To answer all the debt he owes to you
736	Even with the bloody payment of your deaths:
737	Therefore, I say--
738	
739	EARL OF WORCESTER	                  Peace, cousin, say no more:
740	And now I will unclasp a secret book,
741	And to your quick-conceiving discontents
742	I'll read you matter deep and dangerous,
743	As full of peril and adventurous spirit
744	As to o'er-walk a current roaring loud
745	On the unsteadfast footing of a spear.
746	
747	HOTSPUR	If he fall in, good night! or sink or swim:
748	Send danger from the east unto the west,
749	So honour cross it from the north to south,
750	And let them grapple: O, the blood more stirs
751	To rouse a lion than to start a hare!
752	
753	NORTHUMBERLAND	Imagination of some great exploit
754	Drives him beyond the bounds of patience.
755	
756	HOTSPUR	By heaven, methinks it were an easy leap,
757	To pluck bright honour from the pale-faced moon,
758	Or dive into the bottom of the deep,
759	Where fathom-line could never touch the ground,
760	And pluck up drowned honour by the locks;
761	So he that doth redeem her thence might wear
762	Without corrival, all her dignities:
763	But out upon this half-faced fellowship!
764	
765	EARL OF WORCESTER	He apprehends a world of figures here,
766	But not the form of what he should attend.
767	Good cousin, give me audience for a while.
768	
769	HOTSPUR	I cry you mercy.
770	
771	EARL OF WORCESTER	                  Those same noble Scots
772	That are your prisoners,--
773	
774	HOTSPUR	I'll keep them all;
775	By God, he shall not have a Scot of them;
776	No, if a Scot would save his soul, he shall not:
777	I'll keep them, by this hand.
778	
779	EARL OF WORCESTER	You start away
780	And lend no ear unto my purposes.
781	Those prisoners you shall keep.
782	
783	HOTSPUR	Nay, I will; that's flat:
784	He said he would not ransom Mortimer;
785	Forbad my tongue to speak of Mortimer;
786	But I will find him when he lies asleep,
787	And in his ear I'll holla 'Mortimer!'
788	Nay,
789	I'll have a starling shall be taught to speak
790	Nothing but 'Mortimer,' and give it him
791	To keep his anger still in motion.
792	
793	EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear you, cousin; a word.
794	
795	HOTSPUR	All studies here I solemnly defy,
796	Save how to gall and pinch this Bolingbroke:
797	And that same sword-and-buckler Prince of Wales,
798	But that I think his father loves him not
799	And would be glad he met with some mischance,
800	I would have him poison'd with a pot of ale.
801	
802	EARL OF WORCESTER	Farewell, kinsman: I'll talk to you
803	When you are better temper'd to attend.
804	
805	NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, what a wasp-stung and impatient fool
806	Art thou to break into this woman's mood,
807	Tying thine ear to no tongue but thine own!
808	
809	HOTSPUR	Why, look you, I am whipp'd and scourged with rods,
810	Nettled and stung with pismires, when I hear
811	Of this vile politician, Bolingbroke.
812	In Richard's time,--what do you call the place?--
813	A plague upon it, it is in Gloucestershire;
814	'Twas where the madcap duke his uncle kept,
815	His uncle York; where I first bow'd my knee
816	Unto this king of smiles, this Bolingbroke,--
817	'Sblood!--
818	When you and he came back from Ravenspurgh.
819	
820	NORTHUMBERLAND	At Berkley castle.
821	
822	HOTSPUR	You say true:
823	Why, what a candy deal of courtesy
824	This fawning greyhound then did proffer me!
825	Look,'when his infant fortune came to age,'
826	And 'gentle Harry Percy,' and 'kind cousin;'
827	O, the devil take such cozeners! God forgive me!
828	Good uncle, tell your tale; I have done.
829	
830	EARL OF WORCESTER	Nay, if you have not, to it again;
831	We will stay your leisure.
832	
833	HOTSPUR	I have done, i' faith.
834	
835	EARL OF WORCESTER	Then once more to your Scottish prisoners.
836	Deliver them up without their ransom straight,
837	And make the Douglas' son your only mean
838	For powers in Scotland; which, for divers reasons
839	Which I shall send you written, be assured,
840	Will easily be granted. You, my lord,
841	
842	[To Northumberland]
843	
844	Your son in Scotland being thus employ'd,
845	Shall secretly into the bosom creep
846	Of that same noble prelate, well beloved,
847	The archbishop.
848	
849	HOTSPUR	Of York, is it not?
850	
851	EARL OF WORCESTER	True; who bears hard
852	His brother's death at Bristol, the Lord Scroop.
853	I speak not this in estimation,
854	As what I think might be, but what I know
855	Is ruminated, plotted and set down,
856	And only stays but to behold the face
857	Of that occasion that shall bring it on.
858	
859	HOTSPUR	I smell it: upon my life, it will do well.
860	
861	NORTHUMBERLAND	Before the game is afoot, thou still let'st slip.
862	
863	HOTSPUR	Why, it cannot choose but be a noble plot;
864	And then the power of Scotland and of York,
865	To join with Mortimer, ha?
866	
867	EARL OF WORCESTER	And so they shall.
868	
869	HOTSPUR	In faith, it is exceedingly well aim'd.
870	
871	EARL OF WORCESTER	And 'tis no little reason bids us speed,
872	To save our heads by raising of a head;
873	For, bear ourselves as even as we can,
874	The king will always think him in our debt,
875	And think we think ourselves unsatisfied,
876	Till he hath found a time to pay us home:
877	And see already how he doth begin
878	To make us strangers to his looks of love.
879	
880	HOTSPUR	He does, he does: we'll be revenged on him.
881	
882	EARL OF WORCESTER	Cousin, farewell: no further go in this
883	Than I by letters shall direct your course.
884	When time is ripe, which will be suddenly,
885	I'll steal to Glendower and Lord Mortimer;
886	Where you and Douglas and our powers at once,
887	As I will fashion it, shall happily meet,
888	To bear our fortunes in our own strong arms,
889	Which now we hold at much uncertainty.
890	
891	NORTHUMBERLAND	Farewell, good brother: we shall thrive, I trust.
892	
893	HOTSPUR	Uncle, Adieu: O, let the hours be short
894	Till fields and blows and groans applaud our sport!

907	
908	SCENE I	Rochester. An inn yard.
909	
910	
911	[Enter a Carrier with a lantern in his hand]
912	
913	First Carrier	Heigh-ho! an it be not four by the day, I'll be
914	hanged: Charles' wain is over the new chimney, and
915	yet our horse not packed. What, ostler!
916	
917	Ostler	[Within]   Anon, anon.
918	
919	First Carrier	I prithee, Tom, beat Cut's saddle, put a few flocks
920	in the point; poor jade, is wrung in the withers out
921	of all cess.
922	
923	[Enter another Carrier]
924	
925	Second Carrier	Peas and beans are as dank here as a dog, and that
926	is the next way to give poor jades the bots: this
927	house is turned upside down since Robin Ostler died.
928	
929	First Carrier	Poor fellow, never joyed since the price of oats
930	rose; it was the death of him.
931	
932	Second Carrier	I think this be the most villanous house in all
933	London road for fleas: I am stung like a tench.
934	
935	First Carrier	Like a tench! by the mass, there is ne'er a king
936	christen could be better bit than I have been since
937	the first cock.
938	
939	Second Carrier	Why, they will allow us ne'er a jordan, and then we
940	leak in your chimney; and your chamber-lie breeds
941	fleas like a loach.
942	
943	First Carrier	What, ostler! come away and be hanged!
944	
945	Second Carrier	I have a gammon of bacon and two razors of ginger,
946	to be delivered as far as Charing-cross.
947	
948	First Carrier	God's body! the turkeys in my pannier are quite
949	starved. What, ostler! A plague on thee! hast thou
950	never an eye in thy head? canst not hear? An
951	'twere not as good deed as drink, to break the pate
952	on thee, I am a very villain. Come, and be hanged!
953	hast thou no faith in thee?
954	
955	[Enter GADSHILL]
956	
957	GADSHILL	Good morrow, carriers. What's o'clock?
958	
959	First Carrier	I think it be two o'clock.
960	
961	GADSHILL	I pray thee lend me thy lantern, to see my gelding
962	in the stable.
963	
964	First Carrier	Nay, by God, soft; I know a trick worth two of that, i' faith.
965	
966	GADSHILL	I pray thee, lend me thine.
967	
968	Second Carrier	Ay, when? can'st tell? Lend me thy lantern, quoth
969	he? marry, I'll see thee hanged first.
970	
971	GADSHILL	Sirrah carrier, what time do you mean to come to London?
972	
973	Second Carrier	Time enough to go to bed with a candle, I warrant
974	thee. Come, neighbour Mugs, we'll call up the
975	gentleman: they will along with company, for they
976	have great charge.
977	
978	[Exeunt carriers]
979	
980	GADSHILL	What, ho! chamberlain!
981	
982	Chamberlain	[Within]  At hand, quoth pick-purse.
983	
984	GADSHILL	That's even as fair as--at hand, quoth the
985	chamberlain; for thou variest no more from picking
986	of purses than giving direction doth from labouring;
987	thou layest the plot how.
988	
989	[Enter Chamberlain]
990	
991	Chamberlain	Good morrow, Master Gadshill. It holds current that
992	I told you yesternight: there's a franklin in the
993	wild of Kent hath brought three hundred marks with
994	him in gold: I heard him tell it to one of his
995	company last night at supper; a kind of auditor; one
996	that hath abundance of charge too, God knows what.
997	They are up already, and call for eggs and butter;
998	they will away presently.
999	
1000	GADSHILL	Sirrah, if they meet not with Saint Nicholas'
1001	clerks, I'll give thee this neck.
1002	
1003	Chamberlain	No, I'll none of it: I pray thee keep that for the
1004	hangman; for I know thou worshippest St. Nicholas
1005	as truly as a man of falsehood may.
1006	
1007	GADSHILL	What talkest thou to me of the hangman? if I hang,
1008	I'll make a fat pair of gallows; for if I hang, old
1009	Sir John hangs with me, and thou knowest he is no
1010	starveling. Tut! there are other Trojans that thou
1011	dreamest not of, the which for sport sake are
1012	content to do the profession some grace; that would,
1013	if matters should be looked into, for their own
1014	credit sake, make all whole. I am joined with no
1015	foot-land rakers, no long-staff sixpenny strikers,
1016	none of these mad mustachio purple-hued malt-worms;
1017	but with nobility and tranquillity, burgomasters and
1018	great oneyers, such as can hold in, such as will
1019	strike sooner than speak, and speak sooner than
1020	drink, and drink sooner than pray: and yet, zounds,
1021	I lie; for they pray continually to their saint, the
1022	commonwealth; or rather, not pray to her, but prey
1023	on her, for they ride up and down on her and make
1024	her their boots.
1025	
1026	Chamberlain	What, the commonwealth their boots? will she hold
1027	out water in foul way?
1028	
1029	GADSHILL	She will, she will; justice hath liquored her. We
1030	steal as in a castle, cocksure; we have the receipt
1031	of fern-seed, we walk invisible.
1032	
1033	Chamberlain	Nay, by my faith, I think you are more beholding to
1034	the night than to fern-seed for your walking invisible.
1035	
1036	GADSHILL	Give me thy hand: thou shalt have a share in our
1037	purchase, as I am a true man.
1038	
1039	Chamberlain	Nay, rather let me have it, as you are a false thief.
1040	
1041	GADSHILL	Go to; 'homo' is a common name to all men. Bid the
1042	ostler bring my gelding out of the stable. Farewell,
1043	you muddy knave.

1060	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
1061	
1062	POINS	Come, shelter, shelter: I have removed Falstaff's
1063	horse, and he frets like a gummed velvet.
1064	
1065	PRINCE HENRY	Stand close.
1066	
1067	[Enter FALSTAFF]
1068	
1069	FALSTAFF	Poins! Poins, and be hanged! Poins!

1073	
1074	FALSTAFF	Where's Poins, Hal?
1075	
1076	PRINCE HENRY	He is walked up to the top of the hill: I'll go seek him.
1077	
1078	FALSTAFF	I am accursed to rob in that thief's company: the
1079	rascal hath removed my horse, and tied him I know
1080	not where. If I travel but four foot by the squier
1081	further afoot, I shall break my wind. Well, I doubt
1082	not but to die a fair death for all this, if I
1083	'scape hanging for killing that rogue. I have
1084	forsworn his company hourly any time this two and
1085	twenty years, and yet I am bewitched with the
1086	rogue's company. If the rascal hath not given me
1087	medicines to make me love him, I'll be hanged; it
1088	could not be else: I have drunk medicines. Poins!
1089	Hal! a plague upon you both! Bardolph! Peto!
1090	I'll starve ere I'll rob a foot further. An 'twere
1091	not as good a deed as drink, to turn true man and to
1092	leave these rogues, I am the veriest varlet that
1093	ever chewed with a tooth. Eight yards of uneven
1094	ground is threescore and ten miles afoot with me;
1095	and the stony-hearted villains know it well enough:
1096	a plague upon it when thieves cannot be true one to another!
1097	
1098	[They whistle]
1099	
1100	Whew! A plague upon you all! Give me my horse, you
1101	rogues; give me my horse, and be hanged!
1102	
1103	PRINCE HENRY	Peace, ye fat-guts! lie down; lay thine ear close
1104	to the ground and list if thou canst hear the tread
1105	of travellers.
1106	
1107	FALSTAFF	Have you any levers to lift me up again, being down?
1108	'Sblood, I'll not bear mine own flesh so far afoot
1109	again for all the coin in thy father's exchequer.
1110	What a plague mean ye to colt me thus?
1111	
1112	
1113	PRINCE HENRY	Thou liest; thou art not colted, thou art uncolted.
1114	
1115	FALSTAFF	I prithee, good Prince Hal, help me to my horse,
1116	good king's son.
1117	
1118	PRINCE HENRY	Out, ye rogue! shall I be your ostler?
1119	
1120	FALSTAFF	Go, hang thyself in thine own heir-apparent
1121	garters! If I be ta'en, I'll peach for this. An I
1122	have not ballads made on you all and sung to filthy
1123	tunes, let a cup of sack be my poison: when a jest
1124	is so forward, and afoot too! I hate it.
1125	
1126	[Enter GADSHILL, BARDOLPH and PETO]
1127	
1128	GADSHILL	Stand.
1129	
1130	FALSTAFF	So I do, against my will.
1131	
1132	POINS	O, 'tis our setter: I know his voice. Bardolph,
1133	what news?
1134	
1135	BARDOLPH	Case ye, case ye; on with your vizards: there 's
1136	money of the king's coming down the hill; 'tis going
1137	to the king's exchequer.
1138	
1139	FALSTAFF	You lie, ye rogue; 'tis going to the king's tavern.
1140	
1141	GADSHILL	There's enough to make us all.
1142	
1143	FALSTAFF	To be hanged.
1144	
1145	PRINCE HENRY	Sirs, you four shall front them in the narrow lane;
1146	Ned Poins and I will walk lower: if they 'scape
1147	from your encounter, then they light on us.
1148	
1149	PETO	How many be there of them?
1150	
1151	GADSHILL	Some eight or ten.
1152	
1153	FALSTAFF	'Zounds, will they not rob us?
1154	
1155	PRINCE HENRY	What, a coward, Sir John Paunch?
1156	
1157	FALSTAFF	Indeed, I am not John of Gaunt, your grandfather;
1158	but yet no coward, Hal.
1159	
1160	PRINCE HENRY	Well, we leave that to the proof.
1161	
1162	POINS	Sirrah Jack, thy horse stands behind the hedge:
1163	when thou needest him, there thou shalt find him.
1164	Farewell, and stand fast.
1165	
1166	FALSTAFF	Now cannot I strike him, if I should be hanged.
1167	
1168	PRINCE HENRY	Ned, where are our disguises?
1169	
1170	POINS	Here, hard by: stand close.
1171	
1172	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
1173	
1174	FALSTAFF	Now, my masters, happy man be his dole, say I:
1175	every man to his business.
1176	
1177	[Enter the Travellers]
1178	
1179	First Traveller	Come, neighbour: the boy shall lead our horses down
1180	the hill; we'll walk afoot awhile, and ease our legs.
1181	
1182	Thieves	Stand!
1183	
1184	Travellers	Jesus bless us!
1185	
1186	FALSTAFF	Strike; down with them; cut the villains' throats:
1187	ah! whoreson caterpillars! bacon-fed knaves! they
1188	hate us youth: down with them: fleece them.
1189	
1190	Travellers	O, we are undone, both we and ours for ever!
1191	
1192	FALSTAFF	Hang ye, gorbellied knaves, are ye undone? No, ye
1193	fat chuffs: I would your store were here! On,
1194	bacons, on! What, ye knaves! young men must live.
1195	You are Grand-jurors, are ye? we'll jure ye, 'faith.
1196	
1197	[Here they rob them and bind them. Exeunt]
1198	
1199	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
1200	
1201	PRINCE HENRY	The thieves have bound the true men. Now could thou
1202	and I rob the thieves and go merrily to London, it
1203	would be argument for a week, laughter for a month
1204	and a good jest for ever.
1205	
1206	POINS	Stand close; I hear them coming.
1207	
1208	[Enter the Thieves again]
1209	
1210	FALSTAFF	Come, my masters, let us share, and then to horse
1211	before day. An the Prince and Poins be not two
1212	arrant cowards, there's no equity stirring: there's
1213	no more valour in that Poins than in a wild-duck.
1214	
1215	PRINCE HENRY	Your money!
1216	
1217	POINS	Villains!
1218	
1219	[As they are sharing, the Prince and Poins set upon
1220	them; they all run away; and Falstaff, after a blow
1221	or two, runs away too, leaving the booty behind them]
1222	
1223	PRINCE HENRY	Got with much ease. Now merrily to horse:
1224	The thieves are all scatter'd and possess'd with fear
1225	So strongly that they dare not meet each other;
1226	Each takes his fellow for an officer.
1227	Away, good Ned. Falstaff sweats to death,
1228	And lards the lean earth as he walks along:
1229	Were 't not for laughing, I should pity him.
1230	
1231	POINS	How the rogue roar'd!

1247	
1248	[Enter HOTSPUR, solus, reading a letter]
1249	
1250	HOTSPUR	'But for mine own part, my lord, I could be well
1251	contented to be there, in respect of the love I bear
1252	your house.' He could be contented: why is he not,
1253	then? In respect of the love he bears our house:
1254	he shows in this, he loves his own barn better than
1255	he loves our house. Let me see some more. 'The
1256	purpose you undertake is dangerous;'--why, that's
1257	certain: 'tis dangerous to take a cold, to sleep, to
1258	drink; but I tell you, my lord fool, out of this
1259	nettle, danger, we pluck this flower, safety. 'The
1260	purpose you undertake is dangerous; the friends you
1261	have named uncertain; the time itself unsorted; and
1262	your whole plot too light for the counterpoise of so
1263	great an opposition.' Say you so, say you so? I say
1264	unto you again, you are a shallow cowardly hind, and
1265	you lie.  What a lack-brain is this! By the Lord,
1266	our plot is a good plot as ever was laid; our
1267	friends true and constant: a good plot, good
1268	friends, and full of expectation; an excellent plot,
1269	very good friends. What a frosty-spirited rogue is
1270	this! Why, my lord of York commends the plot and the
1271	general course of action. 'Zounds, an I were now by
1272	this rascal, I could brain him with his lady's fan.
1273	Is there not my father, my uncle and myself? lord
1274	Edmund Mortimer, My lord of York and Owen Glendower?
1275	is there not besides the Douglas? have I not all
1276	their letters to meet me in arms by the ninth of the
1277	next month? and are they not some of them set
1278	forward already? What a pagan rascal is this! an
1279	infidel! Ha! you shall see now in very sincerity
1280	of fear and cold heart, will he to the king and lay
1281	open all our proceedings. O, I could divide myself
1282	and go to buffets, for moving such a dish of
1283	skim milk with so honourable an action! Hang him!
1284	let him tell the king: we are prepared. I will set
1285	forward to-night.
1286	
1287	[Enter LADY PERCY]
1288	
1289	How now, Kate! I must leave you within these two hours.
1290	
1291	LADY PERCY	O, my good lord, why are you thus alone?
1292	For what offence have I this fortnight been
1293	A banish'd woman from my Harry's bed?
1294	Tell me, sweet lord, what is't that takes from thee
1295	Thy stomach, pleasure and thy golden sleep?
1296	Why dost thou bend thine eyes upon the earth,
1297	And start so often when thou sit'st alone?
1298	Why hast thou lost the fresh blood in thy cheeks;
1299	And given my treasures and my rights of thee
1300	To thick-eyed musing and cursed melancholy?
1301	In thy faint slumbers I by thee have watch'd,
1302	And heard thee murmur tales of iron wars;
1303	Speak terms of manage to thy bounding steed;
1304	Cry 'Courage! to the field!' And thou hast talk'd
1305	Of sallies and retires, of trenches, tents,
1306	Of palisadoes, frontiers, parapets,
1307	Of basilisks, of cannon, culverin,
1308	Of prisoners' ransom and of soldiers slain,
1309	And all the currents of a heady fight.
1310	Thy spirit within thee hath been so at war
1311	And thus hath so bestirr'd thee in thy sleep,
1312	That beads of sweat have stood upon thy brow
1313	Like bubbles in a late-disturbed stream;
1314	And in thy face strange motions have appear'd,
1315	Such as we see when men restrain their breath
1316	On some great sudden hest. O, what portents are these?
1317	Some heavy business hath my lord in hand,
1318	And I must know it, else he loves me not.

1322	[Enter Servant]
1323	
1324	Is Gilliams with the packet gone?
1325	
1326	Servant	He is, my lord, an hour ago.
1327	
1328	
1329	HOTSPUR	Hath Butler brought those horses from the sheriff?
1330	
1331	Servant	One horse, my lord, he brought even now.
1332	
1333	HOTSPUR	What horse? a roan, a crop-ear, is it not?
1334	
1335	Servant	It is, my lord.
1336	
1337	HOTSPUR	                  That roan shall by my throne.
1338	Well, I will back him straight: O esperance!
1339	Bid Butler lead him forth into the park.

1348	
1349	HOTSPUR	Why, my horse, my love, my horse.
1350	
1351	LADY PERCY	Out, you mad-headed ape!
1352	A weasel hath not such a deal of spleen
1353	As you are toss'd with. In faith,
1354	I'll know your business, Harry, that I will.
1355	I fear my brother Mortimer doth stir
1356	About his title, and hath sent for you
1357	To line his enterprise: but if you go,--
1358	
1359	HOTSPUR	So far afoot, I shall be weary, love.
1360	
1361	LADY PERCY	Come, come, you paraquito, answer me
1362	Directly unto this question that I ask:
1363	In faith, I'll break thy little finger, Harry,
1364	An if thou wilt not tell me all things true.
1365	
1366	HOTSPUR	Away,
1367	Away, you trifler! Love! I love thee not,
1368	I care not for thee, Kate: this is no world
1369	To play with mammets and to tilt with lips:
1370	We must have bloody noses and crack'd crowns,
1371	And pass them current too. God's me, my horse!
1372	What say'st thou, Kate? what would'st thou
1373	have with me?
1374	
1375	LADY PERCY	Do you not love me? do you not, indeed?
1376	Well, do not then; for since you love me not,
1377	I will not love myself. Do you not love me?
1378	Nay, tell me if you speak in jest or no.
1379	
1380	HOTSPUR	Come, wilt thou see me ride?
1381	And when I am on horseback, I will swear
1382	I love thee infinitely. But hark you, Kate;
1383	I must not have you henceforth question me
1384	Whither I go, nor reason whereabout:
1385	Whither I must, I must; and, to conclude,
1386	This evening must I leave you, gentle Kate.
1387	I know you wise, but yet no farther wise
1388	Than Harry Percy's wife: constant you are,
1389	But yet a woman: and for secrecy,
1390	No lady closer; for I well believe
1391	Thou wilt not utter what thou dost not know;
1392	And so far will I trust thee, gentle Kate.
1393	
1394	LADY PERCY	How! so far?
1395	
1396	HOTSPUR	Not an inch further. But hark you, Kate:
1397	Whither I go, thither shall you go too;
1398	To-day will I set forth, to-morrow you.
1399	Will this content you, Kate?

1418	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
1419	
1420	PRINCE HENRY	Ned, prithee, come out of that fat room, and lend me
1421	thy hand to laugh a little.
1422	
1423	POINS	Where hast been, Hal?
1424	
1425	PRINCE HENRY	With three or four loggerheads amongst three or four
1426	score hogsheads. I have sounded the very
1427	base-string of humility. Sirrah, I am sworn brother
1428	to a leash of drawers; and can call them all by
1429	their christen names, as Tom, Dick, and Francis.
1430	They take it already upon their salvation, that
1431	though I be but the prince of Wales, yet I am king
1432	of courtesy; and tell me flatly I am no proud Jack,
1433	like Falstaff, but a Corinthian, a lad of mettle, a
1434	good boy, by the Lord, so they call me, and when I
1435	am king of England, I shall command all the good
1436	lads in Eastcheap. They call drinking deep, dyeing
1437	scarlet; and when you breathe in your watering, they
1438	cry  'hem!' and bid you play it off. To conclude, I
1439	am so good a proficient in one quarter of an hour,
1440	that I can drink with any tinker in his own language
1441	during my life. I tell thee, Ned, thou hast lost
1442	much honour, that thou wert not with me in this sweet
1443	action. But, sweet Ned,--to sweeten which name of
1444	Ned, I give thee this pennyworth of sugar, clapped
1445	even now into my hand by an under-skinker, one that
1446	never spake other English in his life than 'Eight
1447	shillings and sixpence' and 'You are welcome,' with
1448	this shrill addition, 'Anon, anon, sir! Score a pint
1449	of bastard in the Half-Moon,' or so. But, Ned, to
1450	drive away the time till Falstaff come, I prithee,
1451	do thou stand in some by-room, while I question my
1452	puny drawer to what end he gave me the sugar; and do
1453	thou never leave calling 'Francis,' that his tale
1454	to me may be nothing but 'Anon.' Step aside, and
1455	I'll show thee a precedent.
1456

1482	of pewter. But, Francis, darest thou be so valiant
1483	as to play the coward with thy indenture and show it
1484	a fair pair of heels and run from it?
1485	
1486	FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, I'll be sworn upon all the books in
1487	England, I could find in my heart.

1500

1502	gavest me,'twas a pennyworth, wast't not?
1503	
1504	FRANCIS	O Lord, I would it had been two!
1505	
1506	PRINCE HENRY	I will give thee for it a thousand pound: ask me
1507	when thou wilt, and thou shalt have it.

1514	or, Francis, o' Thursday; or indeed, Francis, when
1515	thou wilt. But, Francis!

1520	not-pated, agate-ring, puke-stocking, caddis-garter,
1521	smooth-tongue, Spanish-pouch,--
1522	
1523	FRANCIS	O Lord, sir, who do you mean?
1524	
1525	PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, your brown bastard is your only drink;
1526	for look you, Francis, your white canvas doublet
1527	will sully: in Barbary, sir, it cannot come to so much.
1528	
1529	FRANCIS	What, sir?
1530

1532

1559	
1560	POINS	As merry as crickets, my lad. But hark ye; what
1561	cunning match have you made with this jest of the
1562	drawer? come, what's the issue?
1563	
1564	PRINCE HENRY	I am now of all humours that have showed themselves
1565	humours since the old days of goodman Adam to the
1566	pupil age of this present twelve o'clock at midnight.

1574	[Exit]
1575	
1576	PRINCE HENRY	That ever this fellow should have fewer words than a
1577	parrot, and yet the son of a woman! His industry is
1578	upstairs and downstairs; his eloquence the parcel of
1579	a reckoning. I am not yet of Percy's mind, the
1580	Hotspur of the north; he that kills me some six or
1581	seven dozen of Scots at a breakfast, washes his
1582	hands, and says to his wife 'Fie upon this quiet
1583	life! I want work.' 'O my sweet Harry,' says she,
1584	'how many hast thou killed to-day?' 'Give my roan
1585	horse a drench,' says he; and answers 'Some
1586	fourteen,' an hour after; 'a trifle, a trifle.' I
1587	prithee, call in Falstaff: I'll play Percy, and
1588	that damned brawn shall play Dame Mortimer his
1589	wife. 'Rivo!' says the drunkard. Call in ribs, call in tallow.
1590	
1591	[Enter FALSTAFF, GADSHILL, BARDOLPH, and PETO;
1592	FRANCIS following with wine]
1593	
1594	POINS	Welcome, Jack: where hast thou been?
1595	
1596	FALSTAFF	A plague of all cowards, I say, and a vengeance too!
1597	marry, and amen! Give me a cup of sack, boy. Ere I
1598	lead this life long, I'll sew nether stocks and mend
1599	them and foot them too. A plague of all cowards!
1600	Give me a cup of sack, rogue. Is there no virtue extant?
1601	
1602	[He drinks]
1603	
1604	PRINCE HENRY	Didst thou never see Titan kiss a dish of butter?
1605	pitiful-hearted Titan, that melted at the sweet tale
1606	of the sun's! if thou didst, then behold that compound.
1607	
1608	FALSTAFF	You rogue, here's lime in this sack too: there is
1609	nothing but roguery to be found in villanous man:
1610	yet a coward is worse than a cup of sack with lime
1611	in it. A villanous coward! Go thy ways, old Jack;
1612	die when thou wilt, if manhood, good manhood, be
1613	not forgot upon the face of the earth, then am I a
1614	shotten herring. There live not three good men
1615	unhanged in England; and one of them is fat and
1616	grows old: God help the while! a bad world, I say.
1617	I would I were a weaver; I could sing psalms or any
1618	thing. A plague of all cowards, I say still.
1619	
1620	PRINCE HENRY	How now, wool-sack! what mutter you?
1621	
1622	FALSTAFF	A king's son! If I do not beat thee out of thy
1623	kingdom with a dagger of lath, and drive all thy
1624	subjects afore thee like a flock of wild-geese,
1625	I'll never wear hair on my face more. You Prince of Wales!
1626	
1627	PRINCE HENRY	Why, you whoreson round man, what's the matter?
1628	
1629	FALSTAFF	Are not you a coward? answer me to that: and Poins there?
1630	
1631	POINS	'Zounds, ye fat paunch, an ye call me coward, by the
1632	Lord, I'll stab thee.
1633	
1634	FALSTAFF	I call thee coward! I'll see thee damned ere I call
1635	thee coward: but I would give a thousand pound I
1636	could run as fast as thou canst. You are straight
1637	enough in the shoulders, you care not who sees your
1638	back: call you that backing of your friends? A
1639	plague upon such backing! give me them that will
1640	face me. Give me a cup of sack: I am a rogue, if I
1641	drunk to-day.
1642	
1643	PRINCE HENRY	O villain! thy lips are scarce wiped since thou
1644	drunkest last.
1645	
1646	FALSTAFF	All's one for that.
1647	
1648	[He drinks]
1649	
1650	A plague of all cowards, still say I.
1651	
1652	PRINCE HENRY	What's the matter?
1653	
1654	FALSTAFF	What's the matter! there be four of us here have
1655	ta'en a thousand pound this day morning.
1656	
1657	PRINCE HENRY	Where is it, Jack? where is it?
1658	
1659	FALSTAFF	Where is it! taken from us it is: a hundred upon
1660	poor four of us.
1661	
1662	PRINCE HENRY	What, a hundred, man?
1663	
1664	FALSTAFF	I am a rogue, if I were not at half-sword with a
1665	dozen of them two hours together. I have 'scaped by
1666	miracle. I am eight times thrust through the
1667	doublet, four through the hose; my buckler cut
1668	through and through; my sword hacked like a
1669	hand-saw--ecce signum! I never dealt better since
1670	I was a man: all would not do. A plague of all
1671	cowards! Let them speak: if they speak more or
1672	less than truth, they are villains and the sons of darkness.
1673	
1674	PRINCE HENRY	Speak, sirs; how was it?
1675	
1676	GADSHILL	We four set upon some dozen--
1677	
1678	FALSTAFF	Sixteen at least, my lord.
1679	
1680	GADSHILL	And bound them.
1681	
1682	PETO	No, no, they were not bound.
1683	
1684	FALSTAFF	You rogue, they were bound, every man of them; or I
1685	am a Jew else, an Ebrew Jew.
1686	
1687	GADSHILL	As we were sharing, some six or seven fresh men set upon us--
1688	
1689	FALSTAFF	And unbound the rest, and then come in the other.
1690	
1691	PRINCE HENRY	What, fought you with them all?
1692	
1693	FALSTAFF	All! I know not what you call all; but if I fought
1694	not with fifty of them, I am a bunch of radish: if
1695	there were not two or three and fifty upon poor old
1696	Jack, then am I no two-legged creature.
1697	
1698	PRINCE HENRY	Pray God you have not murdered some of them.
1699	
1700	FALSTAFF	Nay, that's past praying for: I have peppered two
1701	of them; two I am sure I have paid, two rogues
1702	in buckram suits. I tell thee what, Hal, if I tell
1703	thee a lie, spit in my face, call me horse. Thou
1704	knowest my old ward; here I lay and thus I bore my
1705	point. Four rogues in buckram let drive at me--
1706	
1707	PRINCE HENRY	What, four? thou saidst but two even now.
1708	
1709	FALSTAFF	Four, Hal; I told thee four.
1710	
1711	POINS	Ay, ay, he said four.
1712	
1713	FALSTAFF	These four came all a-front, and mainly thrust at
1714	me. I made me no more ado but took all their seven
1715	points in my target, thus.
1716	
1717	PRINCE HENRY	Seven? why, there were but four even now.
1718	
1719	FALSTAFF	In buckram?
1720	
1721	POINS	Ay, four, in buckram suits.
1722	
1723	FALSTAFF	Seven, by these hilts, or I am a villain else.
1724	
1725	PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, let him alone; we shall have more anon.
1726	
1727	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear me, Hal?
1728	
1729	PRINCE HENRY	Ay, and mark thee too, Jack.
1730	
1731	FALSTAFF	Do so, for it is worth the listening to. These nine
1732	in buckram that I told thee of--
1733	
1734	PRINCE HENRY	So, two more already.
1735	
1736	FALSTAFF	Their points being broken,--
1737	
1738	POINS	Down fell their hose.
1739	
1740	FALSTAFF	Began to give me ground: but I followed me close,
1741	came in foot and hand; and with a thought seven of
1742	the eleven I paid.
1743	
1744	PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! eleven buckram men grown out of two!
1745	
1746	FALSTAFF	But, as the devil would have it, three misbegotten
1747	knaves in Kendal green came at my back and let drive
1748	at me; for it was so dark, Hal, that thou couldst
1749	not see thy hand.
1750	
1751	PRINCE HENRY	These lies are like their father that begets them;
1752	gross as a mountain, open, palpable. Why, thou
1753	clay-brained guts, thou knotty-pated fool, thou
1754	whoreson, obscene, grease tallow-catch,--
1755	
1756	FALSTAFF	What, art thou mad? art thou mad? is not the truth
1757	the truth?
1758	
1759	PRINCE HENRY	Why, how couldst thou know these men in Kendal
1760	green, when it was so dark thou couldst not see thy
1761	hand? come, tell us your reason: what sayest thou to this?
1762	
1763	POINS	Come, your reason, Jack, your reason.
1764	
1765	FALSTAFF	What, upon compulsion? 'Zounds, an I were at the
1766	strappado, or all the racks in the world, I would
1767	not tell you on compulsion. Give you a reason on
1768	compulsion! If reasons were as plentiful as
1769	blackberries, I would give no man a reason upon
1770	compulsion, I.
1771	
1772	PRINCE HENRY	I'll be no longer guilty of this sin; this sanguine
1773	coward, this bed-presser, this horseback-breaker,
1774	this huge hill of flesh,--
1775	
1776	FALSTAFF	'Sblood, you starveling, you elf-skin, you dried
1777	neat's tongue, you bull's pizzle, you stock-fish! O
1778	for breath to utter what is like thee! you
1779	tailor's-yard, you sheath, you bowcase; you vile
1780	standing-tuck,--
1781	
1782	PRINCE HENRY	Well, breathe awhile, and then to it again: and
1783	when thou hast tired thyself in base comparisons,
1784	hear me speak but this.
1785	
1786	POINS	Mark, Jack.
1787	
1788	PRINCE HENRY	We two saw you four set on four and bound them, and
1789	were masters of their wealth. Mark now, how a plain
1790	tale shall put you down. Then did we two set on you
1791	four; and, with a word, out-faced you from your
1792	prize, and have it; yea, and can show it you here in
1793	the house: and, Falstaff, you carried your guts
1794	away as nimbly, with as quick dexterity, and roared
1795	for mercy and still run and roared, as ever I heard
1796	bull-calf. What a slave art thou, to hack thy sword
1797	as thou hast done, and then say it was in fight!
1798	What trick, what device, what starting-hole, canst
1799	thou now find out to hide thee from this open and
1800	apparent shame?
1801	
1802	POINS	Come, let's hear, Jack; what trick hast thou now?
1803	
1804	FALSTAFF	By the Lord, I knew ye as well as he that made ye.
1805	Why, hear you, my masters: was it for me to kill the
1806	heir-apparent? should I turn upon the true prince?
1807	why, thou knowest I am as valiant as Hercules: but
1808	beware instinct; the lion will not touch the true
1809	prince. Instinct is a great matter; I was now a
1810	coward on instinct. I shall think the better of
1811	myself and thee during my life; I for a valiant
1812	lion, and thou for a true prince. But, by the Lord,
1813	lads, I am glad you have the money. Hostess, clap
1814	to the doors: watch to-night, pray to-morrow.
1815	Gallants, lads, boys, hearts of gold, all the titles
1816	of good fellowship come to you! What, shall we be
1817	merry? shall we have a play extempore?
1818	
1819	PRINCE HENRY	Content; and the argument shall be thy running away.
1820	
1821	FALSTAFF	Ah, no more of that, Hal, an thou lovest me!
1822	
1823	[Enter Hostess]
1824	
1825	Hostess	O Jesu, my lord the prince!
1826	
1827	PRINCE HENRY	How now, my lady the hostess! what sayest thou to
1828	me?
1829	
1830	Hostess	Marry, my lord, there is a nobleman of the court at
1831	door would speak with you: he says he comes from
1832	your father.
1833	
1834	PRINCE HENRY	Give him as much as will make him a royal man, and
1835	send him back again to my mother.
1836	
1837	FALSTAFF	What manner of man is he?
1838	
1839	Hostess	An old man.
1840	
1841	FALSTAFF	What doth gravity out of his bed at midnight? Shall
1842	I give him his answer?
1843	
1844	PRINCE HENRY	Prithee, do, Jack.
1845	
1846	FALSTAFF	'Faith, and I'll send him packing.
1847	
1848	[Exit FALSTAFF]
1849	
1850	PRINCE HENRY	Now, sirs: by'r lady, you fought fair; so did you,
1851	Peto; so did you, Bardolph: you are lions too, you
1852	ran away upon instinct, you will not touch the true
1853	prince; no, fie!
1854	
1855	BARDOLPH	'Faith, I ran when I saw others run.
1856	
1857	PRINCE HENRY	'Faith, tell me now in earnest, how came Falstaff's
1858	sword so hacked?
1859	
1860	PETO	Why, he hacked it with his dagger, and said he would
1861	swear truth out of England but he would make you
1862	believe it was done in fight, and persuaded us to do the like.
1863	
1864	BARDOLPH	Yea, and to tickle our noses with spear-grass to
1865	make them bleed, and then to beslubber our garments
1866	with it and swear it was the blood of true men. I
1867	did that I did not this seven year before, I blushed
1868	to hear his monstrous devices.
1869	
1870	PRINCE HENRY	O villain, thou stolest a cup of sack eighteen years
1871	ago, and wert taken with the manner, and ever since
1872	thou hast blushed extempore. Thou hadst fire and
1873	sword on thy side, and yet thou rannest away: what
1874	instinct hadst thou for it?
1875	
1876	BARDOLPH	My lord, do you see these meteors? do you behold
1877	these exhalations?
1878	
1879	PRINCE HENRY	I do.
1880	
1881	BARDOLPH	What think you they portend?
1882	
1883	PRINCE HENRY	Hot livers and cold purses.
1884	
1885	BARDOLPH	Choler, my lord, if rightly taken.
1886	
1887	PRINCE HENRY	No, if rightly taken, halter.
1888	
1889	[Re-enter FALSTAFF]
1890	
1891	Here comes lean Jack, here comes bare-bone.
1892	How now, my sweet creature of bombast!
1893	How long is't ago, Jack, since thou sawest thine own knee?
1894	
1895	FALSTAFF	My own knee! when I was about thy years, Hal, I was
1896	not an eagle's talon in the waist; I could have
1897	crept into any alderman's thumb-ring: a plague of
1898	sighing and grief! it blows a man up like a
1899	bladder. There's villanous news abroad: here was
1900	Sir John Bracy from your father; you must to the
1901	court in the morning. That same mad fellow of the
1902	north, Percy, and he of Wales, that gave Amamon the
1903	bastinado and made Lucifer cuckold and swore the
1904	devil his true liegeman upon the cross of a Welsh
1905	hook--what a plague call you him?
1906	
1907	POINS	O, Glendower.
1908	
1909	FALSTAFF	Owen, Owen, the same; and his son-in-law Mortimer,
1910	and old Northumberland, and that sprightly Scot of
1911	Scots, Douglas, that runs o' horseback up a hill
1912	perpendicular,--
1913	
1914	PRINCE HENRY	He that rides at high speed and with his pistol
1915	kills a sparrow flying.
1916	
1917	FALSTAFF	You have hit it.
1918	
1919	PRINCE HENRY	So did he never the sparrow.
1920	
1921	FALSTAFF	Well, that rascal hath good mettle in him; he will not run.
1922	
1923	PRINCE HENRY	Why, what a rascal art thou then, to praise him so
1924	for running!
1925	
1926	FALSTAFF	O' horseback, ye cuckoo; but afoot he will not budge a foot.
1927	
1928	PRINCE HENRY	Yes, Jack, upon instinct.
1929	
1930	FALSTAFF	I grant ye, upon instinct. Well, he is there too,
1931	and one Mordake, and a thousand blue-caps more:
1932	Worcester is stolen away to-night; thy father's
1933	beard is turned white with the news: you may buy
1934	land now as cheap as stinking mackerel.
1935	
1936	PRINCE HENRY	Why, then, it is like, if there come a hot June and
1937	this civil buffeting hold, we shall buy maidenheads
1938	as they buy hob-nails, by the hundreds.
1939	
1940	FALSTAFF	By the mass, lad, thou sayest true; it is like we
1941	shall have good trading that way. But tell me, Hal,
1942	art not thou horrible afeard? thou being
1943	heir-apparent, could the world pick thee out three
1944	such enemies again as that fiend Douglas, that
1945	spirit Percy, and that devil Glendower? Art thou
1946	not horribly afraid? doth not thy blood thrill at
1947	it?
1948	
1949	PRINCE HENRY	Not a whit, i' faith; I lack some of thy instinct.
1950	
1951	FALSTAFF	Well, thou wert be horribly chid tomorrow when thou
1952	comest to thy father: if thou love me, practise an answer.
1953	
1954	PRINCE HENRY	Do thou stand for my father, and examine me upon the
1955	particulars of my life.
1956	
1957	FALSTAFF	Shall I? content: this chair shall be my state,
1958	this dagger my sceptre, and this cushion my crown.
1959	
1960	PRINCE HENRY	Thy state is taken for a joined-stool, thy golden
1961	sceptre for a leaden dagger, and thy precious rich
1962	crown for a pitiful bald crown!
1963	
1964	FALSTAFF	Well, an the fire of grace be not quite out of thee,
1965	now shalt thou be moved. Give me a cup of sack to
1966	make my eyes look red, that it may be thought I have
1967	wept; for I must speak in passion, and I will do it
1968	in King Cambyses' vein.
1969	
1970	PRINCE HENRY	Well, here is my leg.
1971	
1972	FALSTAFF	And here is my speech. Stand aside, nobility.
1973	
1974	Hostess	O Jesu, this is excellent sport, i' faith!
1975	
1976	FALSTAFF	Weep not, sweet queen; for trickling tears are vain.
1977	
1978	Hostess	O, the father, how he holds his countenance!
1979	
1980	FALSTAFF	For God's sake, lords, convey my tristful queen;
1981	For tears do stop the flood-gates of her eyes.
1982	
1983	Hostess	O Jesu, he doth it as like one of these harlotry
1984	players as ever I see!
1985	
1986	FALSTAFF	Peace, good pint-pot; peace, good tickle-brain.
1987	Harry, I do not only marvel where thou spendest thy
1988	time, but also how thou art accompanied: for though
1989	the camomile, the more it is trodden on the faster
1990	it grows, yet youth, the more it is wasted the
1991	sooner it wears. That thou art my son, I have
1992	partly thy mother's word, partly my own opinion,
1993	but chiefly a villanous trick of thine eye and a
1994	foolish-hanging of thy nether lip, that doth warrant
1995	me. If then thou be son to me, here lies the point;
1996	why, being son to me, art thou so pointed at? Shall
1997	the blessed sun of heaven prove a micher and eat
1998	blackberries? a question not to be asked. Shall
1999	the sun of England prove a thief and take purses? a
2000	question to be asked. There is a thing, Harry,
2001	which thou hast often heard of and it is known to
2002	many in our land by the name of pitch: this pitch,
2003	as ancient writers do report, doth defile; so doth
2004	the company thou keepest: for, Harry, now I do not
2005	speak to thee in drink but in tears, not in
2006	pleasure but in passion, not in words only, but in
2007	woes also: and yet there is a virtuous man whom I
2008	have often noted in thy company, but I know not his name.
2009	
2010	PRINCE HENRY	What manner of man, an it like your majesty?
2011	
2012	FALSTAFF	A goodly portly man, i' faith, and a corpulent; of a
2013	cheerful look, a pleasing eye and a most noble
2014	carriage; and, as I think, his age some fifty, or,
2015	by'r lady, inclining to three score; and now I
2016	remember me, his name is Falstaff: if that man
2017	should be lewdly given, he deceiveth me; for, Harry,
2018	I see virtue in his looks. If then the tree may be
2019	known by the fruit, as the fruit by the tree, then,
2020	peremptorily I speak it, there is virtue in that
2021	Falstaff: him keep with, the rest banish. And tell
2022	me now, thou naughty varlet, tell me, where hast
2023	thou been this month?
2024	
2025	PRINCE HENRY	Dost thou speak like a king? Do thou stand for me,
2026	and I'll play my father.
2027	
2028	FALSTAFF	Depose me? if thou dost it half so gravely, so
2029	majestically, both in word and matter, hang me up by
2030	the heels for a rabbit-sucker or a poulter's hare.
2031	
2032	PRINCE HENRY	Well, here I am set.
2033	
2034	FALSTAFF	And here I stand: judge, my masters.
2035	
2036	PRINCE HENRY	Now, Harry, whence come you?
2037	
2038	FALSTAFF	My noble lord, from Eastcheap.
2039	
2040	PRINCE HENRY	The complaints I hear of thee are grievous.
2041	
2042	FALSTAFF	'Sblood, my lord, they are false: nay, I'll tickle
2043	ye for a young prince, i' faith.
2044	
2045	PRINCE HENRY	Swearest thou, ungracious boy? henceforth ne'er look
2046	on me. Thou art violently carried away from grace:
2047	there is a devil haunts thee in the likeness of an
2048	old fat man; a tun of man is thy companion. Why
2049	dost thou converse with that trunk of humours, that
2050	bolting-hutch of beastliness, that swollen parcel
2051	of dropsies, that huge bombard of sack, that stuffed
2052	cloak-bag of guts, that roasted Manningtree ox with
2053	the pudding in his belly, that reverend vice, that
2054	grey iniquity, that father ruffian, that vanity in
2055	years? Wherein is he good, but to taste sack and
2056	drink it? wherein neat and cleanly, but to carve a
2057	capon and eat it? wherein cunning, but in craft?
2058	wherein crafty, but in villany? wherein villanous,
2059	but in all things? wherein worthy, but in nothing?
2060	
2061	FALSTAFF	I would your grace would take me with you: whom
2062	means your grace?
2063	
2064	PRINCE HENRY	That villanous abominable misleader of youth,
2065	Falstaff, that old white-bearded Satan.
2066	
2067	FALSTAFF	My lord, the man I know.
2068	
2069	PRINCE HENRY	I know thou dost.
2070	
2071	FALSTAFF	But to say I know more harm in him than in myself,
2072	were to say more than I know. That he is old, the
2073	more the pity, his white hairs do witness it; but
2074	that he is, saving your reverence, a whoremaster,
2075	that I utterly deny. If sack and sugar be a fault,
2076	God help the wicked! if to be old and merry be a
2077	sin, then many an old host that I know is damned: if
2078	to be fat be to be hated, then Pharaoh's lean kine
2079	are to be loved. No, my good lord; banish Peto,
2080	banish Bardolph, banish Poins: but for sweet Jack
2081	Falstaff, kind Jack Falstaff, true Jack Falstaff,
2082	valiant Jack Falstaff, and therefore more valiant,
2083	being, as he is, old Jack Falstaff, banish not him
2084	thy Harry's company, banish not him thy Harry's
2085	company: banish plump Jack, and banish all the world.
2086	
2087	PRINCE HENRY	I do, I will.
2088	
2089	[A knocking heard]
2090	
2091	[Exeunt Hostess, FRANCIS, and BARDOLPH]
2092	
2093	[Re-enter BARDOLPH, running]
2094	
2095	BARDOLPH	O, my lord, my lord! the sheriff with a most
2096	monstrous watch is at the door.
2097	
2098	FALSTAFF	Out, ye rogue! Play out the play: I have much to
2099	say in the behalf of that Falstaff.
2100	
2101	[Re-enter the Hostess]
2102	
2103	Hostess	O Jesu, my lord, my lord!
2104	
2105	PRINCE HENRY	Heigh, heigh! the devil rides upon a fiddlestick:
2106	what's the matter?
2107	
2108	Hostess	The sheriff and all the watch are at the door: they
2109	are come to search the house. Shall I let them in?
2110	
2111	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? never call a true piece of
2112	gold a counterfeit: thou art essentially mad,
2113	without seeming so.
2114	
2115	PRINCE HENRY	And thou a natural coward, without instinct.
2116	
2117	FALSTAFF	I deny your major: if you will deny the sheriff,
2118	so; if not, let him enter: if I become not a cart
2119	as well as another man, a plague on my bringing up!
2120	I hope I shall as soon be strangled with a halter as another.
2121	
2122	PRINCE HENRY	Go, hide thee behind the arras: the rest walk up
2123	above. Now, my masters, for a true face and good
2124	conscience.
2125	
2126	FALSTAFF	Both which I have had: but their date is out, and
2127	therefore I'll hide me.
2128	
2129	PRINCE HENRY	Call in the sheriff.
2130	
2131	[Exeunt all except PRINCE HENRY and PETO]
2132	
2133	[Enter Sheriff and the Carrier]
2134	
2135	Now, master sheriff, what is your will with me?
2136	
2137	Sheriff	First, pardon me, my lord. A hue and cry
2138	Hath follow'd certain men unto this house.
2139	
2140	PRINCE HENRY	What men?
2141	
2142	Sheriff	One of them is well known, my gracious lord,
2143	A gross fat man.
2144	
2145	Carrier	                  As fat as butter.
2146	
2147	PRINCE HENRY	The man, I do assure you, is not here;
2148	For I myself at this time have employ'd him.
2149	And, sheriff, I will engage my word to thee
2150	That I will, by to-morrow dinner-time,
2151	Send him to answer thee, or any man,
2152	For any thing he shall be charged withal:
2153	And so let me entreat you leave the house.
2154	
2155	Sheriff	I will, my lord. There are two gentlemen
2156	Have in this robbery lost three hundred marks.
2157	
2158	PRINCE HENRY	It may be so: if he have robb'd these men,
2159	He shall be answerable; and so farewell.
2160	
2161	Sheriff	Good night, my noble lord.
2162	
2163	PRINCE HENRY	I think it is good morrow, is it not?
2164	
2165	Sheriff	Indeed, my lord, I think it be two o'clock.
2166	
2167	[Exeunt Sheriff and Carrier]
2168	
2169	PRINCE HENRY	This oily rascal is known as well as Paul's. Go,
2170	call him forth.
2171	
2172	PETO	Falstaff!--Fast asleep behind the arras, and
2173	snorting like a horse.
2174	
2175	PRINCE HENRY	Hark, how hard he fetches breath. Search his pockets.
2176	
2177	[He searcheth his pockets, and findeth certain papers]
2178	
2179	What hast thou found?
2180	
2181	PETO	Nothing but papers, my lord.
2182	
2183	PRINCE HENRY	Let's see what they be: read them.
2184	
2185	PETO	[Reads]  Item, A capon,. . 2s. 2d.
2186	Item, Sauce,. . . 4d.
2187	Item, Sack, two gallons, 5s. 8d.
2188	Item, Anchovies and sack after supper, 2s. 6d.
2189	Item, Bread,        ob.
2190	
2191	PRINCE HENRY	O monstrous! but one half-penny-worth of bread to
2192	this intolerable deal of sack! What there is else,
2193	keep close; we'll read it at more advantage: there
2194	let him sleep till day. I'll to the court in the
2195	morning. We must all to the wars, and thy place
2196	shall be honourable. I'll procure this fat rogue a
2197	charge of foot; and I know his death will be a
2198	march of twelve-score. The money shall be paid
2199	back again with advantage. Be with me betimes in
2200	the morning; and so, good morrow, Peto.
2201	
2202	[Exeunt]
2203	
2204	PETO	Good morrow, good my lord.
2205

2209	1 KING HENRY IV
2210	
2211	
2212	ACT III
2213	
2214	
2215	
2216	SCENE I	Bangor. The Archdeacon's house.
2217	
2218	
2219	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, MORTIMER, and GLENDOWER]
2220	
2221	MORTIMER	These promises are fair, the parties sure,
2222	And our induction full of prosperous hope.
2223	
2224	HOTSPUR	Lord Mortimer, and cousin Glendower,
2225	Will you sit down?
2226	And uncle Worcester: a plague upon it!
2227	I have forgot the map.
2228	
2229	GLENDOWER	No, here it is.
2230	Sit, cousin Percy; sit, good cousin Hotspur,
2231	For by that name as oft as Lancaster
2232	Doth speak of you, his cheek looks pale and with
2233	A rising sigh he wisheth you in heaven.
2234	
2235	HOTSPUR	And you in hell, as oft as he hears Owen Glendower spoke of.
2236	
2237	GLENDOWER	I cannot blame him: at my nativity
2238	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
2239	Of burning cressets; and at my birth
2240	The frame and huge foundation of the earth
2241	Shaked like a coward.
2242	
2243	HOTSPUR	Why, so it would have done at the same season, if
2244	your mother's cat had but kittened, though yourself
2245	had never been born.
2246	
2247	GLENDOWER	I say the earth did shake when I was born.
2248	
2249	HOTSPUR	And I say the earth was not of my mind,
2250	If you suppose as fearing you it shook.
2251	
2252	GLENDOWER	The heavens were all on fire, the earth did tremble.
2253	
2254	HOTSPUR	O, then the earth shook to see the heavens on fire,
2255	And not in fear of your nativity.
2256	Diseased nature oftentimes breaks forth
2257	In strange eruptions; oft the teeming earth
2258	Is with a kind of colic pinch'd and vex'd
2259	By the imprisoning of unruly wind
2260	Within her womb; which, for enlargement striving,
2261	Shakes the old beldam earth and topples down
2262	Steeples and moss-grown towers. At your birth
2263	Our grandam earth, having this distemperature,
2264	In passion shook.
2265	
2266	GLENDOWER	                  Cousin, of many men
2267	I do not bear these crossings. Give me leave
2268	To tell you once again that at my birth
2269	The front of heaven was full of fiery shapes,
2270	The goats ran from the mountains, and the herds
2271	Were strangely clamorous to the frighted fields.
2272	These signs have mark'd me extraordinary;
2273	And all the courses of my life do show
2274	I am not in the roll of common men.
2275	Where is he living, clipp'd in with the sea
2276	That chides the banks of England, Scotland, Wales,
2277	Which calls me pupil, or hath read to me?
2278	And bring him out that is but woman's son
2279	Can trace me in the tedious ways of art
2280	And hold me pace in deep experiments.
2281	
2282	HOTSPUR	I think there's no man speaks better Welsh.
2283	I'll to dinner.
2284	
2285	MORTIMER	Peace, cousin Percy; you will make him mad.
2286	
2287	GLENDOWER	I can call spirits from the vasty deep.
2288	
2289	HOTSPUR	Why, so can I, or so can any man;
2290	But will they come when you do call for them?
2291	
2292	GLENDOWER	Why, I can teach you, cousin, to command
2293	The devil.
2294	
2295	HOTSPUR	And I can teach thee, coz, to shame the devil
2296	By telling truth: tell truth and shame the devil.
2297	If thou have power to raise him, bring him hither,
2298	And I'll be sworn I have power to shame him hence.
2299	O, while you live, tell truth and shame the devil!
2300	
2301	MORTIMER	Come, come, no more of this unprofitable chat.
2302	
2303	GLENDOWER	Three times hath Henry Bolingbroke made head
2304	Against my power; thrice from the banks of Wye
2305	And sandy-bottom'd Severn have I sent him
2306	Bootless home and weather-beaten back.
2307	
2308	HOTSPUR	Home without boots, and in foul weather too!
2309	How 'scapes he agues, in the devil's name?
2310	
2311	GLENDOWER	Come, here's the map: shall we divide our right
2312	According to our threefold order ta'en?
2313	
2314	MORTIMER	The archdeacon hath divided it
2315	Into three limits very equally:
2316	England, from Trent and Severn hitherto,
2317	By south and east is to my part assign'd:
2318	All westward, Wales beyond the Severn shore,
2319	And all the fertile land within that bound,
2320	To Owen Glendower: and, dear coz, to you
2321	The remnant northward, lying off from Trent.
2322	And our indentures tripartite are drawn;
2323	Which being sealed interchangeably,
2324	A business that this night may execute,
2325	To-morrow, cousin Percy, you and I
2326	And my good Lord of Worcester will set forth
2327	To meet your father and the Scottish power,
2328	As is appointed us, at Shrewsbury.
2329	My father Glendower is not ready yet,
2330	Not shall we need his help these fourteen days.
2331	Within that space you may have drawn together
2332	Your tenants, friends and neighbouring gentlemen.
2333	
2334	GLENDOWER	A shorter time shall send me to you, lords:
2335	And in my conduct shall your ladies come;
2336	From whom you now must steal and take no leave,
2337	For there will be a world of water shed
2338	Upon the parting of your wives and you.
2339	
2340	HOTSPUR	Methinks my moiety, north from Burton here,
2341	In quantity equals not one of yours:
2342	See how this river comes me cranking in,
2343	And cuts me from the best of all my land
2344	A huge half-moon, a monstrous cantle out.
2345	I'll have the current in this place damm'd up;
2346	And here the smug and silver Trent shall run
2347	In a new channel, fair and evenly;
2348	It shall not wind with such a deep indent,
2349	To rob me of so rich a bottom here.
2350	
2351	GLENDOWER	Not wind? it shall, it must; you see it doth.
2352	
2353	MORTIMER	Yea, but
2354	Mark how he bears his course, and runs me up
2355	With like advantage on the other side;
2356	Gelding the opposed continent as much
2357	As on the other side it takes from you.
2358	
2359	EARL OF WORCESTER	Yea, but a little charge will trench him here
2360	And on this north side win this cape of land;
2361	And then he runs straight and even.
2362	
2363	HOTSPUR	I'll have it so: a little charge will do it.
2364	
2365	GLENDOWER	I'll not have it alter'd.
2366	
2367	HOTSPUR	Will not you?
2368	
2369	GLENDOWER	No, nor you shall not.
2370	
2371	HOTSPUR	Who shall say me nay?
2372	
2373	GLENDOWER	Why, that will I.
2374	
2375	HOTSPUR	Let me not understand you, then; speak it in Welsh.
2376	
2377	GLENDOWER	I can speak English, lord, as well as you;
2378	For I was train'd up in the English court;
2379	Where, being but young, I framed to the harp
2380	Many an English ditty lovely well
2381	And gave the tongue a helpful ornament,
2382	A virtue that was never seen in you.
2383	
2384	HOTSPUR	Marry,
2385	And I am glad of it with all my heart:
2386	I had rather be a kitten and cry mew
2387	Than one of these same metre ballad-mongers;
2388	I had rather hear a brazen canstick turn'd,
2389	Or a dry wheel grate on the axle-tree;
2390	And that would set my teeth nothing on edge,
2391	Nothing so much as mincing poetry:
2392	'Tis like the forced gait of a shuffling nag.
2393	
2394	GLENDOWER	Come, you shall have Trent turn'd.
2395	
2396	HOTSPUR	I do not care: I'll give thrice so much land
2397	To any well-deserving friend;
2398	But in the way of bargain, mark ye me,
2399	I'll cavil on the ninth part of a hair.
2400	Are the indentures drawn? shall we be gone?
2401	
2402	GLENDOWER	The moon shines fair; you may away by night:
2403	I'll haste the writer and withal
2404	Break with your wives of your departure hence:
2405	I am afraid my daughter will run mad,
2406	So much she doteth on her Mortimer.
2407	
2408	[Exit GLENDOWER]
2409	
2410	MORTIMER	Fie, cousin Percy! how you cross my father!
2411	
2412	HOTSPUR	I cannot choose: sometime he angers me
2413	With telling me of the mouldwarp and the ant,
2414	Of the dreamer Merlin and his prophecies,
2415	And of a dragon and a finless fish,
2416	A clip-wing'd griffin and a moulten raven,
2417	A couching lion and a ramping cat,
2418	And such a deal of skimble-skamble stuff
2419	As puts me from my faith. I tell you what;
2420	He held me last night at least nine hours
2421	In reckoning up the several devils' names
2422	That were his lackeys: I cried 'hum,' and 'well, go to,'
2423	But mark'd him not a word. O, he is as tedious
2424	As a tired horse, a railing wife;
2425	Worse than a smoky house: I had rather live
2426	With cheese and garlic in a windmill, far,
2427	Than feed on cates and have him talk to me
2428	In any summer-house in Christendom.
2429	
2430	MORTIMER	In faith, he is a worthy gentleman,
2431	Exceedingly well read, and profited
2432	In strange concealments, valiant as a lion
2433	And as wondrous affable and as bountiful
2434	As mines of India. Shall I tell you, cousin?
2435	He holds your temper in a high respect
2436	And curbs himself even of his natural scope
2437	When you come 'cross his humour; faith, he does:
2438	I warrant you, that man is not alive
2439	Might so have tempted him as you have done,
2440	Without the taste of danger and reproof:
2441	But do not use it oft, let me entreat you.
2442	
2443	EARL OF WORCESTER	In faith, my lord, you are too wilful-blame;
2444	And since your coming hither have done enough
2445	To put him quite beside his patience.
2446	You must needs learn, lord, to amend this fault:
2447	Though sometimes it show greatness, courage, blood,--
2448	And that's the dearest grace it renders you,--
2449	Yet oftentimes it doth present harsh rage,
2450	Defect of manners, want of government,
2451	Pride, haughtiness, opinion and disdain:
2452	The least of which haunting a nobleman
2453	Loseth men's hearts and leaves behind a stain
2454	Upon the beauty of all parts besides,
2455	Beguiling them of commendation.
2456	
2457	HOTSPUR	Well, I am school'd: good manners be your speed!
2458	Here come our wives, and let us take our leave.
2459	
2460	[Re-enter GLENDOWER with the ladies]
2461	
2462	MORTIMER	This is the deadly spite that angers me;
2463	My wife can speak no English, I no Welsh.
2464	
2465	GLENDOWER	My daughter weeps: she will not part with you;
2466	She'll be a soldier too, she'll to the wars.
2467	
2468	MORTIMER	Good father, tell her that she and my aunt Percy
2469	Shall follow in your conduct speedily.
2470	
2471	[Glendower speaks to her in Welsh, and she
2472	answers him in the same]
2473	
2474	GLENDOWER	She is desperate here; a peevish self-wind harlotry,
2475	one that no persuasion can do good upon.
2476	
2477	[The lady speaks in Welsh]
2478	
2479	MORTIMER	I understand thy looks: that pretty Welsh
2480	Which thou pour'st down from these swelling heavens
2481	I am too perfect in; and, but for shame,
2482	In such a parley should I answer thee.
2483	
2484	[The lady speaks again in Welsh]
2485	
2486	I understand thy kisses and thou mine,
2487	And that's a feeling disputation:
2488	But I will never be a truant, love,
2489	Till I have learned thy language; for thy tongue
2490	Makes Welsh as sweet as ditties highly penn'd,
2491	Sung by a fair queen in a summer's bower,
2492	With ravishing division, to her lute.
2493	
2494	GLENDOWER	Nay, if you melt, then will she run mad.
2495	
2496	[The lady speaks again in Welsh]
2497	
2498	MORTIMER	O, I am ignorance itself in this!
2499	
2500	GLENDOWER	She bids you on the wanton rushes lay you down
2501	And rest your gentle head upon her lap,
2502	And she will sing the song that pleaseth you
2503	And on your eyelids crown the god of sleep.
2504	Charming your blood with pleasing heaviness,
2505	Making such difference 'twixt wake and sleep
2506	As is the difference betwixt day and night
2507	The hour before the heavenly-harness'd team
2508	Begins his golden progress in the east.
2509	
2510	MORTIMER	With all my heart I'll sit and hear her sing:
2511	By that time will our book, I think, be drawn
2512	
2513	GLENDOWER	Do so;
2514	And those musicians that shall play to you
2515	Hang in the air a thousand leagues from hence,
2516	And straight they shall be here: sit, and attend.
2517	
2518	HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, thou art perfect in lying down: come,
2519	quick, quick, that I may lay my head in thy lap.
2520	
2521	LADY PERCY	Go, ye giddy goose.
2522	
2523	[The music plays]
2524	
2525	HOTSPUR	Now I perceive the devil understands Welsh;
2526	And 'tis no marvel he is so humorous.
2527	By'r lady, he is a good musician.
2528	
2529	LADY PERCY	Then should you be nothing but musical for you are
2530	altogether governed by humours. Lie still, ye thief,
2531	and hear the lady sing in Welsh.
2532	
2533	HOTSPUR	I had rather hear Lady, my brach, howl in Irish.
2534	
2535	LADY PERCY	Wouldst thou have thy head broken?
2536	
2537	HOTSPUR	No.
2538	
2539	LADY PERCY	Then be still.
2540	
2541	HOTSPUR	Neither;'tis a woman's fault.
2542	
2543	LADY PERCY	Now God help thee!
2544	
2545	HOTSPUR	To the Welsh lady's bed.
2546	
2547	LADY PERCY	What's that?
2548	
2549	HOTSPUR	Peace! she sings.
2550	
2551	[Here the lady sings a Welsh song]
2552	
2553	HOTSPUR	Come, Kate, I'll have your song too.
2554	
2555	LADY PERCY	Not mine, in good sooth.
2556	
2557	HOTSPUR	Not yours, in good sooth! Heart! you swear like a
2558	comfit-maker's wife. 'Not you, in good sooth,' and
2559	'as true as I live,' and 'as God shall mend me,' and
2560	'as sure as day,'
2561	And givest such sarcenet surety for thy oaths,
2562	As if thou never walk'st further than Finsbury.
2563	Swear me, Kate, like a lady as thou art,
2564	A good mouth-filling oath, and leave 'in sooth,'
2565	And such protest of pepper-gingerbread,
2566	To velvet-guards and Sunday-citizens.
2567	Come, sing.
2568	
2569	LADY PERCY	I will not sing.

2571	HOTSPUR	'Tis the next way to turn tailor, or be red-breast
2572	teacher. An the indentures be drawn, I'll away
2573	within these two hours; and so, come in when ye will.

2575	[Exit]

2577	GLENDOWER	Come, come, Lord Mortimer; you are as slow
2578	As hot Lord Percy is on fire to go.
2579	By this our book is drawn; we'll but seal,
2580	And then to horse immediately.
2581	
2582	MORTIMER	With all my heart.

2591	
2592	ACT III
2593	
2594	
2595	
2596	SCENE II	London. The palace.
2597	
2598	
2599	[Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE HENRY, and others]
2600	
2601	KING HENRY IV	Lords, give us leave; the Prince of Wales and I
2602	Must have some private conference; but be near at hand,
2603	For we shall presently have need of you.
2604	
2605	[Exeunt Lords]
2606	
2607	I know not whether God will have it so,
2608	For some displeasing service I have done,
2609	That, in his secret doom, out of my blood
2610	He'll breed revengement and a scourge for me;
2611	But thou dost in thy passages of life
2612	Make me believe that thou art only mark'd
2613	For the hot vengeance and the rod of heaven
2614	To punish my mistreadings. Tell me else,
2615	Could such inordinate and low desires,
2616	Such poor, such bare, such lewd, such mean attempts,
2617	Such barren pleasures, rude society,
2618	As thou art match'd withal and grafted to,
2619	Accompany the greatness of thy blood
2620	And hold their level with thy princely heart?
2621	
2622	PRINCE HENRY	So please your majesty, I would I could
2623	Quit all offences with as clear excuse
2624	As well as I am doubtless I can purge
2625	Myself of many I am charged withal:
2626	Yet such extenuation let me beg,
2627	As, in reproof of many tales devised,
2628	which oft the ear of greatness needs must hear,
2629	By smiling pick-thanks and base news-mongers,
2630	I may, for some things true, wherein my youth
2631	Hath faulty wander'd and irregular,
2632	Find pardon on my true submission.
2633	
2634	KING HENRY IV	God pardon thee! yet let me wonder, Harry,
2635	At thy affections, which do hold a wing
2636	Quite from the flight of all thy ancestors.
2637	Thy place in council thou hast rudely lost.
2638	Which by thy younger brother is supplied,
2639	And art almost an alien to the hearts
2640	Of all the court and princes of my blood:
2641	The hope and expectation of thy time
2642	Is ruin'd, and the soul of every man
2643	Prophetically doth forethink thy fall.
2644	Had I so lavish of my presence been,
2645	So common-hackney'd in the eyes of men,
2646	So stale and cheap to vulgar company,
2647	Opinion, that did help me to the crown,
2648	Had still kept loyal to possession
2649	And left me in reputeless banishment,
2650	A fellow of no mark nor likelihood.
2651	By being seldom seen, I could not stir
2652	But like a comet I was wonder'd at;
2653	That men would tell their children 'This is he;'
2654	Others would say 'Where, which is Bolingbroke?'
2655	And then I stole all courtesy from heaven,
2656	And dress'd myself in such humility
2657	That I did pluck allegiance from men's hearts,
2658	Loud shouts and salutations from their mouths,
2659	Even in the presence of the crowned king.
2660	Thus did I keep my person fresh and new;
2661	My presence, like a robe pontifical,
2662	Ne'er seen but wonder'd at: and so my state,
2663	Seldom but sumptuous, showed like a feast
2664	And won by rareness such solemnity.
2665	The skipping king, he ambled up and down
2666	With shallow jesters and rash bavin wits,
2667	Soon kindled and soon burnt; carded his state,
2668	Mingled his royalty with capering fools,
2669	Had his great name profaned with their scorns
2670	And gave his countenance, against his name,
2671	To laugh at gibing boys and stand the push
2672	Of every beardless vain comparative,
2673	Grew a companion to the common streets,
2674	Enfeoff'd himself to popularity;
2675	That, being daily swallow'd by men's eyes,
2676	They surfeited with honey and began
2677	To loathe the taste of sweetness, whereof a little
2678	More than a little is by much too much.
2679	So when he had occasion to be seen,
2680	He was but as the cuckoo is in June,
2681	Heard, not regarded; seen, but with such eyes
2682	As, sick and blunted with community,
2683	Afford no extraordinary gaze,
2684	Such as is bent on sun-like majesty
2685	When it shines seldom in admiring eyes;
2686	But rather drowzed and hung their eyelids down,
2687	Slept in his face and render'd such aspect
2688	As cloudy men use to their adversaries,
2689	Being with his presence glutted, gorged and full.
2690	And in that very line, Harry, standest thou;
2691	For thou has lost thy princely privilege
2692	With vile participation: not an eye
2693	But is a-weary of thy common sight,
2694	Save mine, which hath desired to see thee more;
2695	Which now doth that I would not have it do,
2696	Make blind itself with foolish tenderness.
2697	
2698	PRINCE HENRY	I shall hereafter, my thrice gracious lord,
2699	Be more myself.
2700	
2701	KING HENRY IV	                  For all the world
2702	As thou art to this hour was Richard then
2703	When I from France set foot at Ravenspurgh,
2704	And even as I was then is Percy now.
2705	Now, by my sceptre and my soul to boot,
2706	He hath more worthy interest to the state
2707	Than thou the shadow of succession;
2708	For of no right, nor colour like to right,
2709	He doth fill fields with harness in the realm,
2710	Turns head against the lion's armed jaws,
2711	And, being no more in debt to years than thou,
2712	Leads ancient lords and reverend bishops on
2713	To bloody battles and to bruising arms.
2714	What never-dying honour hath he got
2715	Against renowned Douglas! whose high deeds,
2716	Whose hot incursions and great name in arms
2717	Holds from all soldiers chief majority
2718	And military title capital
2719	Through all the kingdoms that acknowledge Christ:
2720	Thrice hath this Hotspur, Mars in swathling clothes,
2721	This infant warrior, in his enterprises
2722	Discomfited great Douglas, ta'en him once,
2723	Enlarged him and made a friend of him,
2724	To fill the mouth of deep defiance up
2725	And shake the peace and safety of our throne.
2726	And what say you to this? Percy, Northumberland,
2727	The Archbishop's grace of York, Douglas, Mortimer,
2728	Capitulate against us and are up.
2729	But wherefore do I tell these news to thee?
2730	Why, Harry, do I tell thee of my foes,
2731	Which art my near'st and dearest enemy?
2732	Thou that art like enough, through vassal fear,
2733	Base inclination and the start of spleen
2734	To fight against me under Percy's pay,
2735	To dog his heels and curtsy at his frowns,
2736	To show how much thou art degenerate.
2737	
2738	PRINCE HENRY	Do not think so; you shall not find it so:
2739	And God forgive them that so much have sway'd
2740	Your majesty's good thoughts away from me!
2741	I will redeem all this on Percy's head
2742	And in the closing of some glorious day
2743	Be bold to tell you that I am your son;
2744	When I will wear a garment all of blood
2745	And stain my favours in a bloody mask,
2746	Which, wash'd away, shall scour my shame with it:
2747	And that shall be the day, whene'er it lights,
2748	That this same child of honour and renown,
2749	This gallant Hotspur, this all-praised knight,
2750	And your unthought-of Harry chance to meet.
2751	For every honour sitting on his helm,
2752	Would they were multitudes, and on my head
2753	My shames redoubled! for the time will come,
2754	That I shall make this northern youth exchange
2755	His glorious deeds for my indignities.
2756	Percy is but my factor, good my lord,
2757	To engross up glorious deeds on my behalf;
2758	And I will call him to so strict account,
2759	That he shall render every glory up,
2760	Yea, even the slightest worship of his time,
2761	Or I will tear the reckoning from his heart.
2762	This, in the name of God, I promise here:
2763	The which if He be pleased I shall perform,
2764	I do beseech your majesty may salve
2765	The long-grown wounds of my intemperance:
2766	If not, the end of life cancels all bands;
2767	And I will die a hundred thousand deaths
2768	Ere break the smallest parcel of this vow.
2769	
2770	KING HENRY IV	A hundred thousand rebels die in this:
2771	Thou shalt have charge and sovereign trust herein.
2772	
2773	[Enter BLUNT]
2774	
2775	How now, good Blunt? thy looks are full of speed.
2776	
2777	SIR WALTER BLUNT	So hath the business that I come to speak of.
2778	Lord Mortimer of Scotland hath sent word
2779	That Douglas and the English rebels met
2780	The eleventh of this month at Shrewsbury
2781	A mighty and a fearful head they are,
2782	If promises be kept on every hand,
2783	As ever offer'd foul play in the state.
2784	
2785	KING HENRY IV	The Earl of Westmoreland set forth to-day;
2786	With him my son, Lord John of Lancaster;
2787	For this advertisement is five days old:
2788	On Wednesday next, Harry, you shall set forward;
2789	On Thursday we ourselves will march: our meeting
2790	Is Bridgenorth: and, Harry, you shall march
2791	Through Gloucestershire; by which account,
2792	Our business valued, some twelve days hence
2793	Our general forces at Bridgenorth shall meet.
2794	Our hands are full of business: let's away;
2795	Advantage feeds him fat, while men delay.

2805	ACT III
2806	
2807	
2808	
2809	SCENE III	Eastcheap. The Boar's-Head Tavern.
2810	
2811	
2812	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
2813	
2814	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, am I not fallen away vilely since this last
2815	action? do I not bate? do I not dwindle? Why my
2816	skin hangs about me like an like an old lady's loose
2817	gown; I am withered like an old apple-john. Well,
2818	I'll repent, and that suddenly, while I am in some
2819	liking; I shall be out of heart shortly, and then I
2820	shall have no strength to repent. An I have not
2821	forgotten what the inside of a church is made of, I
2822	am a peppercorn, a brewer's horse: the inside of a
2823	church! Company, villanous company, hath been the
2824	spoil of me.
2825	
2826	BARDOLPH	Sir John, you are so fretful, you cannot live long.
2827	
2828	FALSTAFF	Why, there is it: come sing me a bawdy song; make
2829	me merry. I was as virtuously given as a gentleman
2830	need to be; virtuous enough; swore little; diced not
2831	above seven times a week; went to a bawdy-house once
2832	in a quarter--of an hour; paid money that I
2833	borrowed, three of four times; lived well and in
2834	good compass: and now I live out of all order, out
2835	of all compass.
2836	
2837	BARDOLPH	Why, you are so fat, Sir John, that you must needs
2838	be out of all compass, out of all reasonable
2839	compass, Sir John.
2840	
2841	FALSTAFF	Do thou amend thy face, and I'll amend my life:
2842	thou art our admiral, thou bearest the lantern in
2843	the poop, but 'tis in the nose of thee; thou art the
2844	Knight of the Burning Lamp.
2845	
2846	BARDOLPH	Why, Sir John, my face does you no harm.
2847	
2848	FALSTAFF	No, I'll be sworn; I make as good use of it as many
2849	a man doth of a Death's-head or a memento mori: I
2850	never see thy face but I think upon hell-fire and
2851	Dives that lived in purple; for there he is in his
2852	robes, burning, burning. If thou wert any way
2853	given to virtue, I would swear by thy face; my oath
2854	should be 'By this fire, that's God's angel:' but
2855	thou art altogether given over; and wert indeed, but
2856	for the light in thy face, the son of utter
2857	darkness. When thou rannest up Gadshill in the
2858	night to catch my horse, if I did not think thou
2859	hadst been an ignis fatuus or a ball of wildfire,
2860	there's no purchase in money. O, thou art a
2861	perpetual triumph, an everlasting bonfire-light!
2862	Thou hast saved me a thousand marks in links and
2863	torches, walking with thee in the night betwixt
2864	tavern and tavern: but the sack that thou hast
2865	drunk me would have bought me lights as good cheap
2866	at the dearest chandler's in Europe. I have
2867	maintained that salamander of yours with fire any
2868	time this two and thirty years; God reward me for
2869	it!
2870	
2871	BARDOLPH	'Sblood, I would my face were in your belly!
2872	
2873	FALSTAFF	God-a-mercy! so should I be sure to be heart-burned.
2874	
2875	[Enter Hostess]
2876	
2877	How now, Dame Partlet the hen! have you inquired
2878	yet who picked my pocket?
2879	
2880	Hostess	Why, Sir John, what do you think, Sir John? do you
2881	think I keep thieves in my house? I have searched,
2882	I have inquired, so has my husband, man by man, boy
2883	by boy, servant by servant: the tithe of a hair
2884	was never lost in my house before.
2885	
2886	FALSTAFF	Ye lie, hostess: Bardolph was shaved and lost many
2887	a hair; and I'll be sworn my pocket was picked. Go
2888	to, you are a woman, go.
2889	
2890	Hostess	Who, I? no; I defy thee: God's light, I was never
2891	called so in mine own house before.
2892	
2893	FALSTAFF	Go to, I know you well enough.
2894	
2895	Hostess	No, Sir John; You do not know me, Sir John. I know
2896	you, Sir John: you owe me money, Sir John; and now
2897	you pick a quarrel to beguile me of it: I bought
2898	you a dozen of shirts to your back.
2899	
2900	FALSTAFF	Dowlas, filthy dowlas: I have given them away to
2901	bakers' wives, and they have made bolters of them.
2902	
2903	Hostess	Now, as I am a true woman, holland of eight
2904	shillings an ell. You owe money here besides, Sir
2905	John, for your diet and by-drinkings, and money lent
2906	you, four and twenty pound.
2907	
2908	FALSTAFF	He had his part of it; let him pay.
2909	
2910	Hostess	He? alas, he is poor; he hath nothing.
2911	
2912	FALSTAFF	How! poor? look upon his face; what call you rich?
2913	let them coin his nose, let them coin his cheeks:
2914	Ill not pay a denier. What, will you make a younker
2915	of me? shall I not take mine case in mine inn but I
2916	shall have my pocket picked? I have lost a
2917	seal-ring of my grandfather's worth forty mark.
2918	
2919	Hostess	O Jesu, I have heard the prince tell him, I know not
2920	how oft, that ring was copper!
2921	
2922	FALSTAFF	How! the prince is a Jack, a sneak-cup: 'sblood, an
2923	he were here, I would cudgel him like a dog, if he
2924	would say so.
2925	
2926	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and PETO, marching, and FALSTAFF
2927	meets them playing on his truncheon like a life]
2928	
2929	How now, lad! is the wind in that door, i' faith?
2930	must we all march?
2931	
2932	BARDOLPH	Yea, two and two, Newgate fashion.
2933	
2934	Hostess	My lord, I pray you, hear me.
2935	
2936	PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou, Mistress Quickly? How doth thy
2937	husband? I love him well; he is an honest man.
2938	
2939	Hostess	Good my lord, hear me.
2940	
2941	FALSTAFF	Prithee, let her alone, and list to me.
2942	
2943	PRINCE HENRY	What sayest thou, Jack?
2944	
2945	FALSTAFF	The other night I fell asleep here behind the arras
2946	and had my pocket picked: this house is turned
2947	bawdy-house; they pick pockets.
2948	
2949	PRINCE HENRY	What didst thou lose, Jack?
2950	
2951	FALSTAFF	Wilt thou believe me, Hal? three or four bonds of
2952	forty pound apiece, and a seal-ring of my
2953	grandfather's.
2954	
2955	PRINCE HENRY	A trifle, some eight-penny matter.
2956	
2957	Hostess	So I told him, my lord; and I said I heard your
2958	grace say so: and, my lord, he speaks most vilely
2959	of you, like a foul-mouthed man as he is; and said
2960	he would cudgel you.
2961	
2962	PRINCE HENRY	What! he did not?
2963	
2964	Hostess	There's neither faith, truth, nor womanhood in me else.
2965	
2966	FALSTAFF	There's no more faith in thee than in a stewed
2967	prune; nor no more truth in thee than in a drawn
2968	fox; and for womanhood, Maid Marian may be the
2969	deputy's wife of the ward to thee. Go, you thing,
2970	go
2971	
2972	Hostess	Say, what thing? what thing?
2973	
2974	FALSTAFF	What thing! why, a thing to thank God on.
2975	
2976	Hostess	I am no thing to thank God on, I would thou
2977	shouldst know it; I am an honest man's wife: and,
2978	setting thy knighthood aside, thou art a knave to
2979	call me so.
2980	
2981	FALSTAFF	Setting thy womanhood aside, thou art a beast to say
2982	otherwise.
2983	
2984	Hostess	Say, what beast, thou knave, thou?
2985	
2986	FALSTAFF	What beast! why, an otter.
2987	
2988	PRINCE HENRY	An otter, Sir John! Why an otter?
2989	
2990	FALSTAFF	Why, she's neither fish nor flesh; a man knows not
2991	where to have her.
2992	
2993	Hostess	Thou art an unjust man in saying so: thou or any
2994	man knows where to have me, thou knave, thou!
2995	
2996	PRINCE HENRY	Thou sayest true, hostess; and he slanders thee most grossly.
2997	
2998	Hostess	So he doth you, my lord; and said this other day you
2999	ought him a thousand pound.
3000	
3001	PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, do I owe you a thousand pound?
3002	
3003	FALSTAFF	A thousand pound, Ha! a million: thy love is worth
3004	a million: thou owest me thy love.
3005	
3006	Hostess	Nay, my lord, he called you Jack, and said he would
3007	cudgel you.
3008	
3009	FALSTAFF	Did I, Bardolph?
3010	
3011	BARDOLPH	Indeed, Sir John, you said so.
3012	
3013	FALSTAFF	Yea, if he said my ring was copper.
3014	
3015	PRINCE HENRY	I say 'tis copper: darest thou be as good as thy word now?
3016	
3017	FALSTAFF	Why, Hal, thou knowest, as thou art but man, I dare:
3018	but as thou art prince, I fear thee as I fear the
3019	roaring of a lion's whelp.
3020	
3021	PRINCE HENRY	And why not as the lion?
3022	
3023	FALSTAFF	The king is to be feared as the lion: dost thou
3024	think I'll fear thee as I fear thy father? nay, an
3025	I do, I pray God my girdle break.
3026	
3027	PRINCE HENRY	O, if it should, how would thy guts fall about thy
3028	knees! But, sirrah, there's no room for faith,
3029	truth, nor honesty in this bosom of thine; it is all
3030	filled up with guts and midriff. Charge an honest
3031	woman with picking thy pocket! why, thou whoreson,
3032	impudent, embossed rascal, if there were anything in
3033	thy pocket but tavern-reckonings, memorandums of
3034	bawdy-houses, and one poor penny-worth of
3035	sugar-candy to make thee long-winded, if thy pocket
3036	were enriched with any other injuries but these, I
3037	am a villain: and yet you will stand to if; you will
3038	not pocket up wrong: art thou not ashamed?
3039	
3040	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, Hal? thou knowest in the state of
3041	innocency Adam fell; and what should poor Jack
3042	Falstaff do in the days of villany? Thou seest I
3043	have more flesh than another man, and therefore more
3044	frailty. You confess then, you picked my pocket?
3045	
3046	PRINCE HENRY	It appears so by the story.
3047	
3048	FALSTAFF	Hostess, I forgive thee: go, make ready breakfast;
3049	love thy husband, look to thy servants, cherish thy
3050	guests: thou shalt find me tractable to any honest
3051	reason: thou seest I am pacified still. Nay,
3052	prithee, be gone.
3053	
3054	[Exit Hostess]
3055	
3056	Now Hal, to the news at court: for the robbery,
3057	lad, how is that answered?
3058	
3059	PRINCE HENRY	O, my sweet beef, I must still be good angel to
3060	thee: the money is paid back again.
3061	
3062	FALSTAFF	O, I do not like that paying back; 'tis a double labour.
3063	
3064	PRINCE HENRY	I am good friends with my father and may do any thing.
3065	
3066	FALSTAFF	Rob me the exchequer the first thing thou doest, and
3067	do it with unwashed hands too.
3068	
3069	BARDOLPH	Do, my lord.
3070	
3071	PRINCE HENRY	I have procured thee, Jack, a charge of foot.
3072	
3073	FALSTAFF	I would it had been of horse. Where shall I find
3074	one that can steal well? O for a fine thief, of the
3075	age of two and twenty or thereabouts! I am
3076	heinously unprovided. Well, God be thanked for
3077	these rebels, they offend none but the virtuous: I
3078	laud them, I praise them.
3079	
3080	PRINCE HENRY	Bardolph!
3081	
3082	BARDOLPH	My lord?
3083	
3084	PRINCE HENRY	Go bear this letter to Lord John of Lancaster, to my
3085	brother John; this to my Lord of Westmoreland.
3086	
3087	[Exit Bardolph]
3088	
3089	Go, Peto, to horse, to horse; for thou and I have
3090	thirty miles to ride yet ere dinner time.
3091	
3092	[Exit Peto]
3093	
3094	Jack, meet me to-morrow in the temple hall at two
3095	o'clock in the afternoon.
3096	There shalt thou know thy charge; and there receive
3097	Money and order for their furniture.
3098	The land is burning; Percy stands on high;
3099	And either we or they must lower lie.
3100	
3101	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
3102	
3103	FALSTAFF	Rare words! brave world! Hostess, my breakfast, come!
3104	O, I could wish this tavern were my drum!
3105	
3106	[Exit]

3111	1 KING HENRY IV
3112	
3113	
3114	ACT IV
3115	
3116	
3117	
3118	SCENE I	The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
3119	
3120	
3121	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, and DOUGLAS]
3122	
3123	HOTSPUR	Well said, my noble Scot: if speaking truth
3124	In this fine age were not thought flattery,
3125	Such attribution should the Douglas have,
3126	As not a soldier of this season's stamp
3127	Should go so general current through the world.
3128	By God, I cannot flatter; I do defy
3129	The tongues of soothers; but a braver place
3130	In my heart's love hath no man than yourself:
3131	Nay, task me to my word; approve me, lord.
3132	
3133	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Thou art the king of honour:
3134	No man so potent breathes upon the ground
3135	But I will beard him.
3136	
3137	HOTSPUR	Do so, and 'tis well.
3138	
3139	[Enter a Messenger with letters]
3140	
3141	What letters hast thou there?--I can but thank you.
3142	
3143	Messenger	These letters come from your father.
3144	
3145	HOTSPUR	Letters from him! why comes he not himself?
3146	
3147	Messenger	He cannot come, my lord; he is grievous sick.
3148	
3149	HOTSPUR	'Zounds! how has he the leisure to be sick
3150	In such a rustling time? Who leads his power?
3151	Under whose government come they along?
3152	
3153	Messenger	His letters bear his mind, not I, my lord.
3154	
3155	EARL OF WORCESTER	I prithee, tell me, doth he keep his bed?
3156	
3157	Messenger	He did, my lord, four days ere I set forth;
3158	And at the time of my departure thence
3159	He was much fear'd by his physicians.
3160	
3161	EARL OF WORCESTER	I would the state of time had first been whole
3162	Ere he by sickness had been visited:
3163	His health was never better worth than now.
3164	
3165	HOTSPUR	Sick now! droop now! this sickness doth infect
3166	The very life-blood of our enterprise;
3167	'Tis catching hither, even to our camp.
3168	He writes me here, that inward sickness--
3169	And that his friends by deputation could not
3170	So soon be drawn, nor did he think it meet
3171	To lay so dangerous and dear a trust
3172	On any soul removed but on his own.
3173	Yet doth he give us bold advertisement,
3174	That with our small conjunction we should on,
3175	To see how fortune is disposed to us;
3176	For, as he writes, there is no quailing now.
3177	Because the king is certainly possess'd
3178	Of all our purposes. What say you to it?
3179	
3180	EARL OF WORCESTER	Your father's sickness is a maim to us.
3181	
3182	HOTSPUR	A perilous gash, a very limb lopp'd off:
3183	And yet, in faith, it is not; his present want
3184	Seems more than we shall find it: were it good
3185	To set the exact wealth of all our states
3186	All at one cast? to set so rich a main
3187	On the nice hazard of one doubtful hour?
3188	It were not good; for therein should we read
3189	The very bottom and the soul of hope,
3190	The very list, the very utmost bound
3191	Of all our fortunes.
3192	
3193	EARL OF DOUGLAS	'Faith, and so we should;
3194	Where now remains a sweet reversion:
3195	We may boldly spend upon the hope of what
3196	Is to come in:
3197	A comfort of retirement lives in this.
3198	
3199	HOTSPUR	A rendezvous, a home to fly unto.
3200	If that the devil and mischance look big
3201	Upon the maidenhead of our affairs.
3202	
3203	EARL OF WORCESTER	But yet I would your father had been here.
3204	The quality and hair of our attempt
3205	Brooks no division: it will be thought
3206	By some, that know not why he is away,
3207	That wisdom, loyalty and mere dislike
3208	Of our proceedings kept the earl from hence:
3209	And think how such an apprehension
3210	May turn the tide of fearful faction
3211	And breed a kind of question in our cause;
3212	For well you know we of the offering side
3213	Must keep aloof from strict arbitrement,
3214	And stop all sight-holes, every loop from whence
3215	The eye of reason may pry in upon us:
3216	This absence of your father's draws a curtain,
3217	That shows the ignorant a kind of fear
3218	Before not dreamt of.
3219	
3220	HOTSPUR	You strain too far.
3221	I rather of his absence make this use:
3222	It lends a lustre and more great opinion,
3223	A larger dare to our great enterprise,
3224	Than if the earl were here; for men must think,
3225	If we without his help can make a head
3226	To push against a kingdom, with his help
3227	We shall o'erturn it topsy-turvy down.
3228	Yet all goes well, yet all our joints are whole.
3229	
3230	EARL OF DOUGLAS	As heart can think: there is not such a word
3231	Spoke of in Scotland as this term of fear.
3232	
3233	[Enter SIR RICHARD VERNON]
3234	
3235	HOTSPUR	My cousin Vernon, welcome, by my soul.
3236	
3237	VERNON	Pray God my news be worth a welcome, lord.
3238	The Earl of Westmoreland, seven thousand strong,
3239	Is marching hitherwards; with him Prince John.
3240	
3241	HOTSPUR	No harm: what more?
3242	
3243	VERNON	And further, I have learn'd,
3244	The king himself in person is set forth,
3245	Or hitherwards intended speedily,
3246	With strong and mighty preparation.
3247	
3248	HOTSPUR	He shall be welcome too. Where is his son,
3249	The nimble-footed madcap Prince of Wales,
3250	And his comrades, that daff'd the world aside,
3251	And bid it pass?
3252	
3253	VERNON	                  All furnish'd, all in arms;
3254	All plumed like estridges that with the wind
3255	Baited like eagles having lately bathed;
3256	Glittering in golden coats, like images;
3257	As full of spirit as the month of May,
3258	And gorgeous as the sun at midsummer;
3259	Wanton as youthful goats, wild as young bulls.
3260	I saw young Harry, with his beaver on,
3261	His cuisses on his thighs, gallantly arm'd
3262	Rise from the ground like feather'd Mercury,
3263	And vaulted with such ease into his seat,
3264	As if an angel dropp'd down from the clouds,
3265	To turn and wind a fiery Pegasus
3266	And witch the world with noble horsemanship.
3267	
3268	HOTSPUR	No more, no more: worse than the sun in March,
3269	This praise doth nourish agues. Let them come:
3270	They come like sacrifices in their trim,
3271	And to the fire-eyed maid of smoky war
3272	All hot and bleeding will we offer them:
3273	The mailed Mars shall on his altar sit
3274	Up to the ears in blood. I am on fire
3275	To hear this rich reprisal is so nigh
3276	And yet not ours. Come, let me taste my horse,
3277	Who is to bear me like a thunderbolt
3278	Against the bosom of the Prince of Wales:
3279	Harry to Harry shall, hot horse to horse,
3280	Meet and ne'er part till one drop down a corse.
3281	O that Glendower were come!
3282	
3283	VERNON	There is more news:
3284	I learn'd in Worcester, as I rode along,
3285	He cannot draw his power this fourteen days.
3286	
3287	EARL OF DOUGLAS	That's the worst tidings that I hear of yet.
3288	
3289	WORCESTER	Ay, by my faith, that bears a frosty sound.
3290	
3291	HOTSPUR	What may the king's whole battle reach unto?
3292	
3293	VERNON	To thirty thousand.
3294	
3295	HOTSPUR	Forty let it be:
3296	My father and Glendower being both away,
3297	The powers of us may serve so great a day
3298	Come, let us take a muster speedily:
3299	Doomsday is near; die all, die merrily.
3300	
3301	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Talk not of dying: I am out of fear
3302	Of death or death's hand for this one-half year.
3303

3310	
3311	
3312	ACT IV
3313	
3314	
3315	
3316	SCENE II	A public road near Coventry.
3317	
3318	
3319	[Enter FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
3320	
3321	FALSTAFF	Bardolph, get thee before to Coventry; fill me a
3322	bottle of sack: our soldiers shall march through;
3323	we'll to Sutton Co'fil' tonight.
3324	
3325	BARDOLPH	Will you give me money, captain?
3326	
3327	FALSTAFF	Lay out, lay out.
3328	
3329	BARDOLPH	This bottle makes an angel.
3330	
3331	FALSTAFF	An if it do, take it for thy labour; and if it make
3332	twenty, take them all; I'll answer the coinage. Bid
3333	my lieutenant Peto meet me at town's end.
3334	
3335	BARDOLPH	I will, captain: farewell.
3336	
3337	[Exit]
3338	
3339	FALSTAFF	If I be not ashamed of my soldiers, I am a soused
3340	gurnet. I have misused the king's press damnably.
3341	I have got, in exchange of a hundred and fifty
3342	soldiers, three hundred and odd pounds. I press me
3343	none but good house-holders, yeoman's sons; inquire
3344	me out contracted bachelors, such as had been asked
3345	twice on the banns; such a commodity of warm slaves,
3346	as had as lieve hear the devil as a drum; such as
3347	fear the report of a caliver worse than a struck
3348	fowl or a hurt wild-duck. I pressed me none but such
3349	toasts-and-butter, with hearts in their bellies no
3350	bigger than pins' heads, and they have bought out
3351	their services; and now my whole charge consists of
3352	ancients, corporals, lieutenants, gentlemen of
3353	companies, slaves as ragged as Lazarus in the
3354	painted cloth, where the glutton's dogs licked his
3355	sores; and such as indeed were never soldiers, but
3356	discarded unjust serving-men, younger sons to
3357	younger brothers, revolted tapsters and ostlers
3358	trade-fallen, the cankers of a calm world and a
3359	long peace, ten times more dishonourable ragged than
3360	an old faced ancient: and such have I, to fill up
3361	the rooms of them that have bought out their
3362	services, that you would think that I had a hundred
3363	and fifty tattered prodigals lately come from
3364	swine-keeping, from eating draff and husks. A mad
3365	fellow met me on the way and told me I had unloaded
3366	all the gibbets and pressed the dead bodies. No eye
3367	hath seen such scarecrows. I'll not march through
3368	Coventry with them, that's flat: nay, and the
3369	villains march wide betwixt the legs, as if they had
3370	gyves on; for indeed I had the most of them out of
3371	prison. There's but a shirt and a half in all my
3372	company; and the half shirt is two napkins tacked
3373	together and thrown over the shoulders like an
3374	herald's coat without sleeves; and the shirt, to say
3375	the truth, stolen from my host at Saint Alban's, or
3376	the red-nose innkeeper of Daventry. But that's all
3377	one; they'll find linen enough on every hedge.
3378	
3379	[Enter the PRINCE and WESTMORELAND]
3380	
3381	PRINCE HENRY	How now, blown Jack! how now, quilt!
3382	
3383	FALSTAFF	What, Hal! how now, mad wag! what a devil dost thou
3384	in Warwickshire? My good Lord of Westmoreland, I
3385	cry you mercy: I thought your honour had already been
3386	at Shrewsbury.
3387	
3388	WESTMORELAND	Faith, Sir John,'tis more than time that I were
3389	there, and you too; but my powers are there already.
3390	The king, I can tell you, looks for us all: we must
3391	away all night.
3392	
3393	FALSTAFF	Tut, never fear me: I am as vigilant as a cat to
3394	steal cream.
3395	
3396	PRINCE HENRY	I think, to steal cream indeed, for thy theft hath
3397	already made thee butter. But tell me, Jack, whose
3398	fellows are these that come after?
3399	
3400	FALSTAFF	Mine, Hal, mine.
3401	
3402	PRINCE HENRY	I did never see such pitiful rascals.
3403	
3404	FALSTAFF	Tut, tut; good enough to toss; food for powder, food
3405	for powder; they'll fill a pit as well as better:
3406	tush, man, mortal men, mortal men.
3407	
3408	WESTMORELAND	Ay, but, Sir John, methinks they are exceeding poor
3409	and bare, too beggarly.
3410	
3411	FALSTAFF	'Faith, for their poverty, I know not where they had
3412	that; and for their bareness, I am sure they never
3413	learned that of me.
3414	
3415	PRINCE HENRY	No I'll be sworn; unless you call three fingers on
3416	the ribs bare. But, sirrah, make haste: Percy is
3417	already in the field.
3418	
3419	FALSTAFF	What, is the king encamped?
3420	
3421	WESTMORELAND	He is, Sir John: I fear we shall stay too long.
3422	
3423	FALSTAFF	Well,
3424	To the latter end of a fray and the beginning of a feast
3425	Fits a dull fighter and a keen guest.

3438	
3439	SCENE III	The rebel camp near Shrewsbury.
3440	
3441	
3442	[Enter HOTSPUR, WORCESTER, DOUGLAS, and VERNON]
3443	
3444	HOTSPUR	We'll fight with him to-night.
3445	
3446	EARL OF WORCESTER	It may not be.
3447	
3448	EARL OF DOUGLAS	You give him then the advantage.
3449	
3450	VERNON	Not a whit.
3451	
3452	HOTSPUR	Why say you so? looks he not for supply?
3453	
3454	VERNON	So do we.
3455	
3456	HOTSPUR	        His is certain, ours is doubtful.
3457	
3458	EARL OF WORCESTER	Good cousin, be advised; stir not tonight.
3459	
3460	VERNON	Do not, my lord.
3461	
3462	EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  You do not counsel well:
3463	You speak it out of fear and cold heart.
3464	
3465	VERNON	Do me no slander, Douglas: by my life,
3466	And I dare well maintain it with my life,
3467	If well-respected honour bid me on,
3468	I hold as little counsel with weak fear
3469	As you, my lord, or any Scot that this day lives:
3470	Let it be seen to-morrow in the battle
3471	Which of us fears.
3472	
3473	EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  Yea, or to-night.
3474	
3475	VERNON	Content.
3476	
3477	HOTSPUR	To-night, say I.
3478	
3479	VERNON	Come, come it nay not be. I wonder much,
3480	Being men of such great leading as you are,
3481	That you foresee not what impediments
3482	Drag back our expedition: certain horse
3483	Of my cousin Vernon's are not yet come up:
3484	Your uncle Worcester's horse came but today;
3485	And now their pride and mettle is asleep,
3486	Their courage with hard labour tame and dull,
3487	That not a horse is half the half of himself.
3488	
3489	HOTSPUR	So are the horses of the enemy
3490	In general, journey-bated and brought low:
3491	The better part of ours are full of rest.
3492	
3493	EARL OF WORCESTER	The number of the king exceedeth ours:
3494	For God's sake. cousin, stay till all come in.
3495	
3496	[The trumpet sounds a parley]
3497	
3498	[Enter SIR WALTER BLUNT]
3499	
3500	SIR WALTER BLUNT	I come with gracious offers from the king,
3501	if you vouchsafe me hearing and respect.
3502	
3503	HOTSPUR	Welcome, Sir Walter Blunt; and would to God
3504	You were of our determination!
3505	Some of us love you well; and even those some
3506	Envy your great deservings and good name,
3507	Because you are not of our quality,
3508	But stand against us like an enemy.
3509	
3510	SIR WALTER BLUNT	And God defend but still I should stand so,
3511	So long as out of limit and true rule
3512	You stand against anointed majesty.
3513	But to my charge. The king hath sent to know
3514	The nature of your griefs, and whereupon
3515	You conjure from the breast of civil peace
3516	Such bold hostility, teaching his duteous land
3517	Audacious cruelty. If that the king
3518	Have any way your good deserts forgot,
3519	Which he confesseth to be manifold,
3520	He bids you name your griefs; and with all speed
3521	You shall have your desires with interest
3522	And pardon absolute for yourself and these
3523	Herein misled by your suggestion.
3524	
3525	HOTSPUR	The king is kind; and well we know the king
3526	Knows at what time to promise, when to pay.
3527	My father and my uncle and myself
3528	Did give him that same royalty he wears;
3529	And when he was not six and twenty strong,
3530	Sick in the world's regard, wretched and low,
3531	A poor unminded outlaw sneaking home,
3532	My father gave him welcome to the shore;
3533	And when he heard him swear and vow to God
3534	He came but to be Duke of Lancaster,
3535	To sue his livery and beg his peace,
3536	With tears of innocency and terms of zeal,
3537	My father, in kind heart and pity moved,
3538	Swore him assistance and perform'd it too.
3539	Now when the lords and barons of the realm
3540	Perceived Northumberland did lean to him,
3541	The more and less came in with cap and knee;
3542	Met him in boroughs, cities, villages,
3543	Attended him on bridges, stood in lanes,
3544	Laid gifts before him, proffer'd him their oaths,
3545	Gave him their heirs, as pages follow'd him
3546	Even at the heels in golden multitudes.
3547	He presently, as greatness knows itself,
3548	Steps me a little higher than his vow
3549	Made to my father, while his blood was poor,
3550	Upon the naked shore at Ravenspurgh;
3551	And now, forsooth, takes on him to reform
3552	Some certain edicts and some strait decrees
3553	That lie too heavy on the commonwealth,
3554	Cries out upon abuses, seems to weep
3555	Over his country's wrongs; and by this face,
3556	This seeming brow of justice, did he win
3557	The hearts of all that he did angle for;
3558	Proceeded further; cut me off the heads
3559	Of all the favourites that the absent king
3560	In deputation left behind him here,
3561	When he was personal in the Irish war.
3562	
3563	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Tut, I came not to hear this.
3564	
3565	HOTSPUR	Then to the point.
3566	In short time after, he deposed the king;
3567	Soon after that, deprived him of his life;
3568	And in the neck of that, task'd the whole state:
3569	To make that worse, suffer'd his kinsman March,
3570	Who is, if every owner were well placed,
3571	Indeed his king, to be engaged in Wales,
3572	There without ransom to lie forfeited;
3573	Disgraced me in my happy victories,
3574	Sought to entrap me by intelligence;
3575	Rated mine uncle from the council-board;
3576	In rage dismiss'd my father from the court;
3577	Broke oath on oath, committed wrong on wrong,
3578	And in conclusion drove us to seek out
3579	This head of safety; and withal to pry
3580	Into his title, the which we find
3581	Too indirect for long continuance.
3582	
3583	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Shall I return this answer to the king?
3584	
3585	HOTSPUR	Not so, Sir Walter: we'll withdraw awhile.
3586	Go to the king; and let there be impawn'd
3587	Some surety for a safe return again,
3588	And in the morning early shall my uncle
3589	Bring him our purposes: and so farewell.
3590	
3591	SIR WALTER BLUNT	I would you would accept of grace and love.
3592	
3593	HOTSPUR	And may be so we shall.
3594	
3595	SIR WALTER BLUNT	Pray God you do.

3610	
3611	
3612	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK and SIR MICHAEL]
3613	
3614	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Hie, good Sir Michael; bear this sealed brief
3615	With winged haste to the lord marshal;
3616	This to my cousin Scroop, and all the rest
3617	To whom they are directed. If you knew
3618	How much they do to import, you would make haste.
3619	
3620	SIR MICHAEL	My good lord,
3621	I guess their tenor.
3622	
3623	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Like enough you do.
3624	To-morrow, good Sir Michael, is a day
3625	Wherein the fortune of ten thousand men
3626	Must bide the touch; for, sir, at Shrewsbury,
3627	As I am truly given to understand,
3628	The king with mighty and quick-raised power
3629	Meets with Lord Harry: and, I fear, Sir Michael,
3630	What with the sickness of Northumberland,
3631	Whose power was in the first proportion,
3632	And what with Owen Glendower's absence thence,
3633	Who with them was a rated sinew too
3634	And comes not in, o'er-ruled by prophecies,
3635	I fear the power of Percy is too weak
3636	To wage an instant trial with the king.
3637	
3638	SIR MICHAEL	Why, my good lord, you need not fear;
3639	There is Douglas and Lord Mortimer.
3640	
3641	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, Mortimer is not there.
3642	
3643	SIR MICHAEL	But there is Mordake, Vernon, Lord Harry Percy,
3644	And there is my Lord of Worcester and a head
3645	Of gallant warriors, noble gentlemen.
3646	
3647	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	And so there is: but yet the king hath drawn
3648	The special head of all the land together:
3649	The Prince of Wales, Lord John of Lancaster,
3650	The noble Westmoreland and warlike Blunt;
3651	And moe corrivals and dear men
3652	Of estimation and command in arms.
3653	
3654	SIR MICHAEL	Doubt not, my lord, they shall be well opposed.
3655	
3656	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I hope no less, yet needful 'tis to fear;
3657	And, to prevent the worst, Sir Michael, speed:
3658	For if Lord Percy thrive not, ere the king
3659	Dismiss his power, he means to visit us,
3660	For he hath heard of our confederacy,
3661	And 'tis but wisdom to make strong against him:
3662	Therefore make haste. I must go write again
3663	To other friends; and so farewell, Sir Michael.

3680	[Enter KING HENRY, PRINCE HENRY, Lord John of
3681	LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND, SIR WALTER BLUNT,
3682	and FALSTAFF]
3683	
3684	KING HENRY IV	How bloodily the sun begins to peer
3685	Above yon busky hill! the day looks pale
3686	At his distemperature.
3687	
3688	PRINCE HENRY	The southern wind
3689	Doth play the trumpet to his purposes,
3690	And by his hollow whistling in the leaves
3691	Foretells a tempest and a blustering day.
3692	
3693	KING HENRY IV	Then with the losers let it sympathize,
3694	For nothing can seem foul to those that win.
3695	
3696	[The trumpet sounds]
3697	
3698	[Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]
3699	
3700	How now, my Lord of Worcester! 'tis not well
3701	That you and I should meet upon such terms
3702	As now we meet. You have deceived our trust,
3703	And made us doff our easy robes of peace,
3704	To crush our old limbs in ungentle steel:
3705	This is not well, my lord, this is not well.
3706	What say you to it? will you again unknit
3707	This curlish knot of all-abhorred war?
3708	And move in that obedient orb again
3709	Where you did give a fair and natural light,
3710	And be no more an exhaled meteor,
3711	A prodigy of fear and a portent
3712	Of broached mischief to the unborn times?
3713	
3714	EARL OF WORCESTER	Hear me, my liege:
3715	For mine own part, I could be well content
3716	To entertain the lag-end of my life
3717	With quiet hours; for I do protest,
3718	I have not sought the day of this dislike.
3719	
3720	KING HENRY IV	You have not sought it! how comes it, then?
3721	
3722	FALSTAFF	Rebellion lay in his way, and he found it.
3723	
3724	PRINCE HENRY	Peace, chewet, peace!
3725	
3726	EARL OF WORCESTER	It pleased your majesty to turn your looks
3727	Of favour from myself and all our house;
3728	And yet I must remember you, my lord,
3729	We were the first and dearest of your friends.
3730	For you my staff of office did I break
3731	In Richard's time; and posted day and night
3732	to meet you on the way, and kiss your hand,
3733	When yet you were in place and in account
3734	Nothing so strong and fortunate as I.
3735	It was myself, my brother and his son,
3736	That brought you home and boldly did outdare
3737	The dangers of the time. You swore to us,
3738	And you did swear that oath at Doncaster,
3739	That you did nothing purpose 'gainst the state;
3740	Nor claim no further than your new-fall'n right,
3741	The seat of Gaunt, dukedom of Lancaster:
3742	To this we swore our aid. But in short space
3743	It rain'd down fortune showering on your head;
3744	And such a flood of greatness fell on you,
3745	What with our help, what with the absent king,
3746	What with the injuries of a wanton time,
3747	The seeming sufferances that you had borne,
3748	And the contrarious winds that held the king
3749	So long in his unlucky Irish wars
3750	That all in England did repute him dead:
3751	And from this swarm of fair advantages
3752	You took occasion to be quickly woo'd
3753	To gripe the general sway into your hand;
3754	Forget your oath to us at Doncaster;
3755	And being fed by us you used us so
3756	As that ungentle hull, the cuckoo's bird,
3757	Useth the sparrow; did oppress our nest;
3758	Grew by our feeding to so great a bulk
3759	That even our love durst not come near your sight
3760	For fear of swallowing; but with nimble wing
3761	We were enforced, for safety sake, to fly
3762	Out of sight and raise this present head;
3763	Whereby we stand opposed by such means
3764	As you yourself have forged against yourself
3765	By unkind usage, dangerous countenance,
3766	And violation of all faith and troth
3767	Sworn to us in your younger enterprise.
3768	
3769	KING HENRY IV	These things indeed you have articulate,
3770	Proclaim'd at market-crosses, read in churches,
3771	To face the garment of rebellion
3772	With some fine colour that may please the eye
3773	Of fickle changelings and poor discontents,
3774	Which gape and rub the elbow at the news
3775	Of hurlyburly innovation:
3776	And never yet did insurrection want
3777	Such water-colours to impaint his cause;
3778	Nor moody beggars, starving for a time
3779	Of pellmell havoc and confusion.
3780	
3781	PRINCE HENRY	In both your armies there is many a soul
3782	Shall pay full dearly for this encounter,
3783	If once they join in trial. Tell your nephew,
3784	The Prince of Wales doth join with all the world
3785	In praise of Henry Percy: by my hopes,
3786	This present enterprise set off his head,
3787	I do not think a braver gentleman,
3788	More active-valiant or more valiant-young,
3789	More daring or more bold, is now alive
3790	To grace this latter age with noble deeds.
3791	For my part, I may speak it to my shame,
3792	I have a truant been to chivalry;
3793	And so I hear he doth account me too;
3794	Yet this before my father's majesty--
3795	I am content that he shall take the odds
3796	Of his great name and estimation,
3797	And will, to save the blood on either side,
3798	Try fortune with him in a single fight.
3799	
3800	KING HENRY IV	And, Prince of Wales, so dare we venture thee,
3801	Albeit considerations infinite
3802	Do make against it. No, good Worcester, no,
3803	We love our people well; even those we love
3804	That are misled upon your cousin's part;
3805	And, will they take the offer of our grace,
3806	Both he and they and you, every man
3807	Shall be my friend again and I'll be his:
3808	So tell your cousin, and bring me word
3809	What he will do: but if he will not yield,
3810	Rebuke and dread correction wait on us
3811	And they shall do their office. So, be gone;
3812	We will not now be troubled with reply:
3813	We offer fair; take it advisedly.
3814	
3815	[Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON]
3816	
3817	PRINCE HENRY	It will not be accepted, on my life:
3818	The Douglas and the Hotspur both together
3819	Are confident against the world in arms.
3820	
3821	KING HENRY IV	Hence, therefore, every leader to his charge;
3822	For, on their answer, will we set on them:
3823	And God befriend us, as our cause is just!
3824	
3825	[Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY and FALSTAFF]
3826	
3827	FALSTAFF	Hal, if thou see me down in the battle and bestride
3828	me, so; 'tis a point of friendship.
3829	
3830	PRINCE HENRY	Nothing but a colossus can do thee that friendship.
3831	Say thy prayers, and farewell.
3832	
3833	FALSTAFF	I  would 'twere bed-time, Hal, and all well.
3834	
3835	PRINCE HENRY	Why, thou owest God a death.
3836	
3837	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
3838	
3839	FALSTAFF	'Tis not due yet; I would be loath to pay him before
3840	his day. What need I be so forward with him that
3841	calls not on me? Well, 'tis no matter; honour pricks
3842	me on. Yea, but how if honour prick me off when I
3843	come on? how then? Can honour set to a leg? no: or
3844	an arm? no: or take away the grief of a wound? no.
3845	Honour hath no skill in surgery, then? no. What is
3846	honour? a word. What is in that word honour? what
3847	is that honour? air. A trim reckoning! Who hath it?
3848	he that died o' Wednesday. Doth he feel it? no.
3849	Doth he hear it? no. 'Tis insensible, then. Yea,
3850	to the dead. But will it not live with the living?
3851	no. Why? detraction will not suffer it. Therefore
3852	I'll none of it. Honour is a mere scutcheon: and so
3853	ends my catechism.

3868	
3869	
3870	[Enter WORCESTER and VERNON]
3871	
3872	EARL OF WORCESTER	O, no, my nephew must not know, Sir Richard,
3873	The liberal and kind offer of the king.
3874	
3875	VERNON	'Twere best he did.
3876	
3877	EARL OF WORCESTER	Then are we all undone.
3878	It is not possible, it cannot be,
3879	The king should keep his word in loving us;
3880	He will suspect us still and find a time
3881	To punish this offence in other faults:
3882	Suspicion all our lives shall be stuck full of eyes;
3883	For treason is but trusted like the fox,
3884	Who, ne'er so tame, so cherish'd and lock'd up,
3885	Will have a wild trick of his ancestors.
3886	Look how we can, or sad or merrily,
3887	Interpretation will misquote our looks,
3888	And we shall feed like oxen at a stall,
3889	The better cherish'd, still the nearer death.
3890	My nephew's trespass may be well forgot;
3891	it hath the excuse of youth and heat of blood,
3892	And an adopted name of privilege,
3893	A hair-brain'd Hotspur, govern'd by a spleen:
3894	All his offences live upon my head
3895	And on his father's; we did train him on,
3896	And, his corruption being ta'en from us,
3897	We, as the spring of all, shall pay for all.
3898	Therefore, good cousin, let not Harry know,
3899	In any case, the offer of the king.
3900	
3901	VERNON	Deliver what you will; I'll say 'tis so.
3902	Here comes your cousin.

3906	HOTSPUR	My uncle is return'd:
3907	Deliver up my Lord of Westmoreland.
3908	Uncle, what news?
3909	
3910	EARL OF WORCESTER	The king will bid you battle presently.
3911	
3912	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Defy him by the Lord of Westmoreland.
3913	
3914	HOTSPUR	Lord Douglas, go you and tell him so.
3915	
3916	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Marry, and shall, and very willingly.
3917	
3918	[Exit]
3919	
3920	EARL OF WORCESTER	There is no seeming mercy in the king.
3921	
3922	HOTSPUR	Did you beg any? God forbid!
3923	
3924	EARL OF WORCESTER	I told him gently of our grievances,
3925	Of his oath-breaking; which he mended thus,
3926	By now forswearing that he is forsworn:
3927	He calls us rebels, traitors; and will scourge
3928	With haughty arms this hateful name in us.
3929	
3930	[Re-enter the EARL OF DOUGLAS]
3931	
3932	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Arm, gentlemen; to arms! for I have thrown
3933	A brave defiance in King Henry's teeth,
3934	And Westmoreland, that was engaged, did bear it;
3935	Which cannot choose but bring him quickly on.
3936	
3937	EARL OF WORCESTER	The Prince of Wales stepp'd forth before the king,
3938	And, nephew, challenged you to single fight.
3939	
3940	HOTSPUR	O, would the quarrel lay upon our heads,
3941	And that no man might draw short breath today
3942	But I and Harry Monmouth! Tell me, tell me,
3943	How show'd his tasking? seem'd it in contempt?
3944	
3945	VERNON	No, by my soul; I never in my life
3946	Did hear a challenge urged more modestly,
3947	Unless a brother should a brother dare
3948	To gentle exercise and proof of arms.
3949	He gave you all the duties of a man;
3950	Trimm'd up your praises with a princely tongue,
3951	Spoke to your deservings like a chronicle,
3952	Making you ever better than his praise
3953	By still dispraising praise valued in you;
3954	And, which became him like a prince indeed,
3955	He made a blushing cital of himself;
3956	And chid his truant youth with such a grace
3957	As if he master'd there a double spirit.
3958	Of teaching and of learning instantly.
3959	There did he pause: but let me tell the world,
3960	If he outlive the envy of this day,
3961	England did never owe so sweet a hope,
3962	So much misconstrued in his wantonness.
3963	
3964	HOTSPUR	Cousin, I think thou art enamoured
3965	On his follies: never did I hear
3966	Of any prince so wild a libertine.
3967	But be he as he will, yet once ere night
3968	I will embrace him with a soldier's arm,
3969	That he shall shrink under my courtesy.
3970	Arm, arm with speed: and, fellows, soldiers, friends,
3971	Better consider what you have to do
3972	Than I, that have not well the gift of tongue,
3973	Can lift your blood up with persuasion.

3976	
3977	Messenger	My lord, here are letters for you.
3978	
3979	HOTSPUR	I cannot read them now.
3980	O gentlemen, the time of life is short!
3981	To spend that shortness basely were too long,
3982	If life did ride upon a dial's point,
3983	Still ending at the arrival of an hour.
3984	An if we live, we live to tread on kings;
3985	If die, brave death, when princes die with us!
3986	Now, for our consciences, the arms are fair,
3987	When the intent of bearing them is just.
3988	
3989	[Enter another Messenger]
3990	
3991	Messenger	My lord, prepare; the king comes on apace.
3992	
3993	HOTSPUR	I thank him, that he cuts me from my tale,
3994	For I profess not talking; only this--
3995	Let each man do his best: and here draw I
3996	A sword, whose temper I intend to stain
3997	With the best blood that I can meet withal
3998	In the adventure of this perilous day.
3999	Now, Esperance! Percy! and set on.
4000	Sound all the lofty instruments of war,
4001	And by that music let us all embrace;

4023	SIR WALTER BLUNT	What is thy name, that in the battle thus
4024	Thou crossest me? what honour dost thou seek
4025	Upon my head?
4026	
4027	EARL OF DOUGLAS	                  Know then, my name is Douglas;
4028	And I do haunt thee in the battle thus
4029	Because some tell me that thou art a king.
4030	
4031	SIR WALTER BLUNT	They tell thee true.
4032	
4033	EARL OF DOUGLAS	The Lord of Stafford dear to-day hath bought
4034	Thy likeness, for instead of thee, King Harry,
4035	This sword hath ended him: so shall it thee,
4036	Unless thou yield thee as my prisoner.
4037	
4038	SIR WALTER BLUNT	I was not born a yielder, thou proud Scot;
4039	And thou shalt find a king that will revenge

4045	HOTSPUR	O Douglas, hadst thou fought at Holmedon thus,
4046	never had triumph'd upon a Scot.
4047	
4048	EARL OF DOUGLAS	All's done, all's won; here breathless lies the king.

4050	HOTSPUR	Where?
4051	
4052	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Here.
4053	
4054	HOTSPUR	This, Douglas? no: I know this face full well:
4055	A gallant knight he was, his name was Blunt;
4056	Semblably furnish'd like the king himself.
4057	
4058	EARL OF DOUGLAS	A fool go with thy soul, whither it goes!
4059	A borrow'd title hast thou bought too dear:
4060	Why didst thou tell me that thou wert a king?
4061	
4062	HOTSPUR	The king hath many marching in his coats.
4063	
4064	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Now, by my sword, I will kill all his coats;
4065	I'll murder all his wardrobe, piece by piece,
4066	Until I meet the king.

4078	for you! here's no vanity! I am as hot as moulten
4079	lead, and as heavy too: God keep lead out of me! I
4080	need no more weight than mine own bowels. I have
4081	led my ragamuffins where they are peppered: there's
4082	not three of my hundred and fifty left alive; and
4083	they are for the town's end, to beg during life.

4090	Under the hoofs of vaunting enemies,
4091	Whose deaths are yet unrevenged: I prithee,
4092	lend me thy sword.
4093	
4094	FALSTAFF	O Hal, I prithee, give me leave to breathe awhile.
4095	Turk Gregory never did such deeds in arms as I have
4096	done this day. I have paid Percy, I have made him sure.
4097	
4098	PRINCE HENRY	He is, indeed; and living to kill thee. I prithee,
4099	lend me thy sword.
4100	
4101	FALSTAFF	Nay, before God, Hal, if Percy be alive, thou get'st
4102	not my sword; but take my pistol, if thou wilt.
4103	
4104	PRINCE HENRY	Give it to me: what, is it in the case?
4105	
4106	FALSTAFF	Ay, Hal; 'tis hot, 'tis hot; there's that will sack a city.
4107	
4108	[PRINCE HENRY draws it out, and finds it to be a
4109	bottle of sack]
4110	
4111	PRINCE HENRY	What, is it a time to jest and dally now?
4112	
4113	[He throws the bottle at him. Exit]
4114	
4115	FALSTAFF	Well, if Percy be alive, I'll pierce him. If he do
4116	come in my way, so: if he do not, if I come in his
4117	willingly, let him make a carbonado of me. I like
4118	not such grinning honour as Sir Walter hath: give me
4119	life: which if I can save, so; if not, honour comes
4120	unlooked for, and there's an end.
4121

4128	
4129	
4130	ACT V
4131	
4132	
4133	
4134	SCENE IV	Another part of the field.
4135	
4136	
4137	[Alarum. Excursions. Enter PRINCE HENRY, LORD JOHN
4138	OF LANCASTER, and EARL OF WESTMORELAND]
4139	
4140	KING HENRY IV	I prithee,
4141	Harry, withdraw thyself; thou bleed'st too much.
4142	Lord John of Lancaster, go you with him.
4143	
4144	LANCASTER	Not I, my lord, unless I did bleed too.
4145	
4146	PRINCE HENRY	I beseech your majesty, make up,
4147	Lest your retirement do amaze your friends.
4148	
4149	KING HENRY IV	I will do so.
4150	My Lord of Westmoreland, lead him to his tent.
4151	
4152	WESTMORELAND	Come, my lord, I'll lead you to your tent.
4153	
4154	PRINCE HENRY	Lead me, my lord? I do not need your help:
4155	And God forbid a shallow scratch should drive
4156	The Prince of Wales from such a field as this,
4157	Where stain'd nobility lies trodden on,
4158	and rebels' arms triumph in massacres!
4159	
4160	LANCASTER	We breathe too long: come, cousin Westmoreland,
4161	Our duty this way lies; for God's sake come.
4162	
4163	[Exeunt LANCASTER and WESTMORELAND]
4164	
4165	PRINCE HENRY	By God, thou hast deceived me, Lancaster;
4166	I did not think thee lord of such a spirit:
4167	Before, I loved thee as a brother, John;
4168	But now, I do respect thee as my soul.
4169	
4170	KING HENRY IV	I saw him hold Lord Percy at the point
4171	With lustier maintenance than I did look for
4172	Of such an ungrown warrior.
4173	
4174	PRINCE HENRY	O, this boy
4175	Lends mettle to us all!
4176	
4177	[Exit]
4178	
4179	[Enter DOUGLAS]
4180	
4181	EARL OF DOUGLAS	Another king! they grow like Hydra's heads:
4182	I am the Douglas, fatal to all those
4183	That wear those colours on them: what art thou,
4184	That counterfeit'st the person of a king?
4185	
4186	KING HENRY IV	The king himself; who, Douglas, grieves at heart
4187	So many of his shadows thou hast met
4188	And not the very king. I have two boys
4189	Seek Percy and thyself about the field:
4190	But, seeing thou fall'st on me so luckily,
4191	I will assay thee: so, defend thyself.
4192	
4193	EARL OF DOUGLAS	I fear thou art another counterfeit;
4194	And yet, in faith, thou bear'st thee like a king:
4195	But mine I am sure thou art, whoe'er thou be,
4196	And thus I win thee.
4197	
4198	[They fight. KING HENRY being in danger, PRINCE
4199	HENRY enters]
4200	
4201	PRINCE HENRY	Hold up thy head, vile Scot, or thou art like
4202	Never to hold it up again! the spirits
4203	Of valiant Shirley, Stafford, Blunt, are in my arms:
4204	It is the Prince of Wales that threatens thee;
4205	Who never promiseth but he means to pay.
4206	
4207	[They fight: DOUGLAS flies]
4208	
4209	Cheerly, my lord	how fares your grace?
4210	Sir Nicholas Gawsey hath for succor sent,
4211	And so hath Clifton: I'll to Clifton straight.
4212	
4213	KING HENRY IV	Stay, and breathe awhile:
4214	Thou hast redeem'd thy lost opinion,
4215	And show'd thou makest some tender of my life,
4216	In this fair rescue thou hast brought to me.
4217	
4218	PRINCE HENRY	O God! they did me too much injury
4219	That ever said I hearken'd for your death.
4220	If it were so, I might have let alone
4221	The insulting hand of Douglas over you,
4222	Which would have been as speedy in your end
4223	As all the poisonous potions in the world
4224	And saved the treacherous labour of your son.
4225	
4226	KING HENRY IV	Make up to Clifton: I'll to Sir Nicholas Gawsey.
4227	
4228	[Exit]
4229	
4230	[Enter HOTSPUR]
4231	
4232	HOTSPUR	If I mistake not, thou art Harry Monmouth.
4233	
4234	PRINCE HENRY	Thou speak'st as if I would deny my name.
4235	
4236	HOTSPUR	My name is Harry Percy.
4237	
4238	PRINCE HENRY	Why, then I see
4239	A very valiant rebel of the name.
4240	I am the Prince of Wales; and think not, Percy,
4241	To share with me in glory any more:
4242	Two stars keep not their motion in one sphere;
4243	Nor can one England brook a double reign,
4244	Of Harry Percy and the Prince of Wales.
4245	
4246	HOTSPUR	Nor shall it, Harry; for the hour is come
4247	To end the one of us; and would to God
4248	Thy name in arms were now as great as mine!
4249	
4250	PRINCE HENRY	I'll make it greater ere I part from thee;
4251	And all the budding honours on thy crest
4252	I'll crop, to make a garland for my head.
4253	
4254	HOTSPUR	I can no longer brook thy vanities.
4255	
4256	[They fight]
4257	
4258	[Enter FALSTAFF]
4259	
4260	FALSTAFF	Well said, Hal! to it Hal! Nay, you shall find no
4261	boy's play here, I can tell you.
4262	
4263	[Re-enter DOUGLAS; he fights with FALSTAFF,
4264	who falls down as if he were dead, and exit
4265	DOUGLAS. HOTSPUR is wounded, and falls]
4266	
4267	HOTSPUR	O, Harry, thou hast robb'd me of my youth!
4268	I better brook the loss of brittle life
4269	Than those proud titles thou hast won of me;
4270	They wound my thoughts worse than sword my flesh:
4271	But thought's the slave of life, and life time's fool;
4272	And time, that takes survey of all the world,
4273	Must have a stop. O, I could prophesy,
4274	But that the earthy and cold hand of death
4275	Lies on my tongue: no, Percy, thou art dust
4276	And food for--
4277	
4278	[Dies]
4279	
4280	PRINCE HENRY	For worms, brave Percy: fare thee well, great heart!
4281	Ill-weaved ambition, how much art thou shrunk!
4282	When that this body did contain a spirit,
4283	A kingdom for it was too small a bound;
4284	But now two paces of the vilest earth
4285	Is room enough: this earth that bears thee dead
4286	Bears not alive so stout a gentleman.
4287	If thou wert sensible of courtesy,
4288	I should not make so dear a show of zeal:
4289	But let my favours hide thy mangled face;
4290	And, even in thy behalf, I'll thank myself
4291	For doing these fair rites of tenderness.
4292	Adieu, and take thy praise with thee to heaven!
4293	Thy ignominy sleep with thee in the grave,
4294	But not remember'd in thy epitaph!
4295	
4296	[He spieth FALSTAFF on the ground]
4297	
4298	What, old acquaintance! could not all this flesh
4299	Keep in a little life? Poor Jack, farewell!
4300	I could have better spared a better man:
4301	O, I should have a heavy miss of thee,
4302	If I were much in love with vanity!
4303	Death hath not struck so fat a deer to-day,
4304	Though many dearer, in this bloody fray.
4305	Embowell'd will I see thee by and by:
4306	Till then in blood by noble Percy lie.
4307	
4308	[Exit PRINCE HENRY]
4309	
4310	FALSTAFF	[Rising up]  Embowelled! if thou embowel me to-day,
4311	I'll give you leave to powder me and eat me too
4312	to-morrow. 'Sblood,'twas time to counterfeit, or
4313	that hot termagant Scot had paid me scot and lot too.
4314	Counterfeit? I lie, I am no counterfeit: to die,
4315	is to be a counterfeit; for he is but the
4316	counterfeit of a man who hath not the life of a man:
4317	but to counterfeit dying, when a man thereby
4318	liveth, is to be no counterfeit, but the true and
4319	perfect image of life indeed. The better part of
4320	valour is discretion; in the which better part I
4321	have saved my life.'Zounds, I am afraid of this
4322	gunpowder Percy, though he be dead: how, if he
4323	should counterfeit too and rise? by my faith, I am
4324	afraid he would prove the better counterfeit.
4325	Therefore I'll make him sure; yea, and I'll swear I
4326	killed him. Why may not he rise as well as I?
4327	Nothing confutes me but eyes, and nobody sees me.
4328	Therefore, sirrah,
4329	
4330	[Stabbing him]
4331	
4332	with a new wound in your thigh, come you along with me.
4333	
4334	[Takes up HOTSPUR on his back]
4335	
4336	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY and LORD JOHN OF LANCASTER]
4337	
4338	PRINCE HENRY	Come, brother John; full bravely hast thou flesh'd
4339	Thy maiden sword.
4340	
4341	LANCASTER	                  But, soft! whom have we here?
4342	Did you not tell me this fat man was dead?
4343	
4344	PRINCE HENRY	I did; I saw him dead,
4345	Breathless and bleeding on the ground. Art
4346	thou alive?
4347	Or is it fantasy that plays upon our eyesight?
4348	I prithee, speak; we will not trust our eyes
4349	Without our ears: thou art not what thou seem'st.
4350	
4351	FALSTAFF	No, that's certain; I am not a double man: but if I
4352	be not Jack Falstaff, then am I a Jack. There is Percy:
4353	
4354	[Throwing the body down]
4355	
4356	if your father will do me any honour, so; if not, let
4357	him kill the next Percy himself. I look to be either
4358	earl or duke, I can assure you.
4359	
4360	PRINCE HENRY	Why, Percy I killed myself and saw thee dead.
4361	
4362	FALSTAFF	Didst thou? Lord, Lord, how this world is given to
4363	lying! I grant you I was down and out of breath;
4364	and so was he: but we rose both at an instant and
4365	fought a long hour by Shrewsbury clock. If I may be
4366	believed, so; if not, let them that should reward
4367	valour bear the sin upon their own heads. I'll take
4368	it upon my death, I gave him this wound in the
4369	thigh: if the man were alive and would deny it,
4370	'zounds, I would make him eat a piece of my sword.
4371	
4372	LANCASTER	This is the strangest tale that ever I heard.
4373	
4374	PRINCE HENRY	This is the strangest fellow, brother John.
4375	Come, bring your luggage nobly on your back:
4376	For my part, if a lie may do thee grace,
4377	I'll gild it with the happiest terms I have.
4378	
4379	[A retreat is sounded]
4380	
4381	The trumpet sounds retreat; the day is ours.
4382	Come, brother, let us to the highest of the field,
4383	To see what friends are living, who are dead.
4384	
4385	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY and LANCASTER]
4386	
4387	FALSTAFF	I'll follow, as they say, for reward. He that
4388	rewards me, God reward him! If I do grow great,
4389	I'll grow less; for I'll purge, and leave sack, and
4390	live cleanly as a nobleman should do.

4402	
4403	
4404	SCENE V	Another part of the field.
4405	
4406	
4407	[The trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY IV, PRINCE
4408	HENRY, LORD JOHN LANCASTER, EARL OF WESTMORELAND,
4409	with WORCESTER and VERNON prisoners]
4410	
4411	KING HENRY IV	Thus ever did rebellion find rebuke.
4412	Ill-spirited Worcester! did not we send grace,
4413	Pardon and terms of love to all of you?
4414	And wouldst thou turn our offers contrary?
4415	Misuse the tenor of thy kinsman's trust?
4416	Three knights upon our party slain to-day,
4417	A noble earl and many a creature else
4418	Had been alive this hour,
4419	If like a Christian thou hadst truly borne
4420	Betwixt our armies true intelligence.
4421	
4422	EARL OF WORCESTER	What I have done my safety urged me to;
4423	And I embrace this fortune patiently,
4424	Since not to be avoided it falls on me.
4425	
4426	KING HENRY IV	Bear Worcester to the death and Vernon too:
4427	Other offenders we will pause upon.
4428	
4429	[Exeunt WORCESTER and VERNON, guarded]
4430	
4431	How goes the field?
4432	
4433	PRINCE HENRY	The noble Scot, Lord Douglas, when he saw
4434	The fortune of the day quite turn'd from him,
4435	The noble Percy slain, and all his men
4436	Upon the foot of fear, fled with the rest;
4437	And falling from a hill, he was so bruised
4438	That the pursuers took him. At my tent
4439	The Douglas is; and I beseech your grace
4440	I may dispose of him.
4441	
4442	KING HENRY IV	With all my heart.
4443	
4444	
4445	PRINCE HENRY	Then, brother John of Lancaster, to you
4446	This honourable bounty shall belong:
4447	Go to the Douglas, and deliver him
4448	Up to his pleasure, ransomless and free:
4449	His valour shown upon our crests to-day
4450	Hath taught us how to cherish such high deeds
4451	Even in the bosom of our adversaries.
4452	
4453	LANCASTER	I thank your grace for this high courtesy,
4454	Which I shall give away immediately.
4455	
4456	KING HENRY IV	Then this remains, that we divide our power.
4457	You, son John, and my cousin Westmoreland
4458	Towards York shall bend you with your dearest speed,
4459	To meet Northumberland and the prelate Scroop,
4460	Who, as we hear, are busily in arms:
4461	Myself and you, son Harry, will towards Wales,
4462	To fight with Glendower and the Earl of March.
4463	Rebellion in this land shall lose his sway,
4464	Meeting the cheque of such another day:
4465	And since this business so fair is done,
4466	Let us not leave till all our own be won.
4467	
4468	[Exeunt]

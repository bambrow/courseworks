81	
82	
83	
84	SCENE I	Elsinore. A platform before the castle.
85	
86	
87	[FRANCISCO at his post. Enter to him BERNARDO]
88	
89	BERNARDO	Who's there?
90	
91	FRANCISCO	Nay, answer me: stand, and unfold yourself.
92	
93	BERNARDO	Long live the king!
94	
95	FRANCISCO	Bernardo?
96	
97	BERNARDO	He.
98	
99	FRANCISCO	You come most carefully upon your hour.
100	
101	BERNARDO	'Tis now struck twelve; get thee to bed, Francisco.
102	
103	FRANCISCO	For this relief much thanks: 'tis bitter cold,
104	And I am sick at heart.
105	
106	BERNARDO	Have you had quiet guard?
107	
108	FRANCISCO	Not a mouse stirring.
109	
110	BERNARDO	Well, good night.
111	If you do meet Horatio and Marcellus,
112	The rivals of my watch, bid them make haste.
113	
114	FRANCISCO	I think I hear them. Stand, ho! Who's there?
115	
116	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
117	
118	HORATIO	Friends to this ground.
119	
120	MARCELLUS	And liegemen to the Dane.
121	
122	FRANCISCO	Give you good night.
123	
124	MARCELLUS	O, farewell, honest soldier:
125	Who hath relieved you?
126	
127	FRANCISCO	Bernardo has my place.
128	Give you good night.
129	
130	[Exit]
131	
132	MARCELLUS	Holla! Bernardo!
133	
134	BERNARDO	Say,
135	What, is Horatio there?
136	
137	HORATIO	A piece of him.
138	
139	BERNARDO	Welcome, Horatio: welcome, good Marcellus.
140	
141	MARCELLUS	What, has this thing appear'd again to-night?
142	
143	BERNARDO	I have seen nothing.
144	
145	MARCELLUS	Horatio says 'tis but our fantasy,
146	And will not let belief take hold of him
147	Touching this dreaded sight, twice seen of us:
148	Therefore I have entreated him along
149	With us to watch the minutes of this night;
150	That if again this apparition come,
151	He may approve our eyes and speak to it.
152	
153	HORATIO	Tush, tush, 'twill not appear.
154	
155	BERNARDO	Sit down awhile;
156	And let us once again assail your ears,
157	That are so fortified against our story
158	What we have two nights seen.
159	
160	HORATIO	Well, sit we down,
161	And let us hear Bernardo speak of this.
162	
163	BERNARDO	Last night of all,
164	When yond same star that's westward from the pole
165	Had made his course to illume that part of heaven
166	Where now it burns, Marcellus and myself,
167	The bell then beating one,--
168	
169	[Enter Ghost]
170	
171	MARCELLUS	Peace, break thee off; look, where it comes again!
172	
173	BERNARDO	In the same figure, like the king that's dead.
174	
175	MARCELLUS	Thou art a scholar; speak to it, Horatio.
176	
177	BERNARDO	Looks it not like the king?  mark it, Horatio.
178	
179	HORATIO	Most like: it harrows me with fear and wonder.
180	
181	BERNARDO	It would be spoke to.
182	
183	MARCELLUS	Question it, Horatio.
184	
185	HORATIO	What art thou that usurp'st this time of night,
186	Together with that fair and warlike form
187	In which the majesty of buried Denmark
188	Did sometimes march? by heaven I charge thee, speak!
189	
190	MARCELLUS	It is offended.
191	
192	BERNARDO	                  See, it stalks away!
193	
194	HORATIO	Stay! speak, speak! I charge thee, speak!
195	
196	[Exit Ghost]
197	
198	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone, and will not answer.
199	
200	BERNARDO	How now, Horatio! you tremble and look pale:
201	Is not this something more than fantasy?
202	What think you on't?
203	
204	HORATIO	Before my God, I might not this believe
205	Without the sensible and true avouch
206	Of mine own eyes.
207	
208	MARCELLUS	                  Is it not like the king?
209	
210	HORATIO	As thou art to thyself:
211	Such was the very armour he had on
212	When he the ambitious Norway combated;
213	So frown'd he once, when, in an angry parle,
214	He smote the sledded Polacks on the ice.
215	'Tis strange.
216	
217	MARCELLUS	Thus twice before, and jump at this dead hour,
218	With martial stalk hath he gone by our watch.
219	
220	HORATIO	In what particular thought to work I know not;
221	But in the gross and scope of my opinion,
222	This bodes some strange eruption to our state.
223	
224	MARCELLUS	Good now, sit down, and tell me, he that knows,
225	Why this same strict and most observant watch
226	So nightly toils the subject of the land,
227	And why such daily cast of brazen cannon,
228	And foreign mart for implements of war;
229	Why such impress of shipwrights, whose sore task
230	Does not divide the Sunday from the week;
231	What might be toward, that this sweaty haste
232	Doth make the night joint-labourer with the day:
233	Who is't that can inform me?
234	
235	HORATIO	That can I;
236	At least, the whisper goes so. Our last king,
237	Whose image even but now appear'd to us,
238	Was, as you know, by Fortinbras of Norway,
239	Thereto prick'd on by a most emulate pride,
240	Dared to the combat; in which our valiant Hamlet--
241	For so this side of our known world esteem'd him--
242	Did slay this Fortinbras; who by a seal'd compact,
243	Well ratified by law and heraldry,
244	Did forfeit, with his life, all those his lands
245	Which he stood seized of, to the conqueror:
246	Against the which, a moiety competent
247	Was gaged by our king; which had return'd
248	To the inheritance of Fortinbras,
249	Had he been vanquisher; as, by the same covenant,
250	And carriage of the article design'd,
251	His fell to Hamlet. Now, sir, young Fortinbras,
252	Of unimproved mettle hot and full,
253	Hath in the skirts of Norway here and there
254	Shark'd up a list of lawless resolutes,
255	For food and diet, to some enterprise
256	That hath a stomach in't; which is no other--
257	As it doth well appear unto our state--
258	But to recover of us, by strong hand
259	And terms compulsatory, those foresaid lands
260	So by his father lost: and this, I take it,
261	Is the main motive of our preparations,
262	The source of this our watch and the chief head
263	Of this post-haste and romage in the land.
264	
265	BERNARDO	I think it be no other but e'en so:
266	Well may it sort that this portentous figure
267	Comes armed through our watch; so like the king
268	That was and is the question of these wars.
269	
270	HORATIO	A mote it is to trouble the mind's eye.
271	In the most high and palmy state of Rome,
272	A little ere the mightiest Julius fell,
273	The graves stood tenantless and the sheeted dead
274	Did squeak and gibber in the Roman streets:
275	As stars with trains of fire and dews of blood,
276	Disasters in the sun; and the moist star
277	Upon whose influence Neptune's empire stands
278	Was sick almost to doomsday with eclipse:
279	And even the like precurse of fierce events,
280	As harbingers preceding still the fates
281	And prologue to the omen coming on,
282	Have heaven and earth together demonstrated
283	Unto our climatures and countrymen.--
284	But soft, behold! lo, where it comes again!
285	
286	[Re-enter Ghost]
287	
288	I'll cross it, though it blast me. Stay, illusion!
289	If thou hast any sound, or use of voice,
290	Speak to me:
291	If there be any good thing to be done,
292	That may to thee do ease and grace to me,
293	Speak to me:
294	
295	[Cock crows]
296	
297	If thou art privy to thy country's fate,
298	Which, happily, foreknowing may avoid, O, speak!
299	Or if thou hast uphoarded in thy life
300	Extorted treasure in the womb of earth,
301	For which, they say, you spirits oft walk in death,
302	Speak of it: stay, and speak! Stop it, Marcellus.
303	
304	MARCELLUS	Shall I strike at it with my partisan?
305	
306	HORATIO	Do, if it will not stand.
307	
308	BERNARDO	'Tis here!
309	
310	HORATIO	'Tis here!
311	
312	MARCELLUS	'Tis gone!
313	
314	[Exit Ghost]
315	
316	We do it wrong, being so majestical,
317	To offer it the show of violence;
318	For it is, as the air, invulnerable,
319	And our vain blows malicious mockery.
320	
321	BERNARDO	It was about to speak, when the cock crew.
322	
323	HORATIO	And then it started like a guilty thing
324	Upon a fearful summons. I have heard,
325	The cock, that is the trumpet to the morn,
326	Doth with his lofty and shrill-sounding throat
327	Awake the god of day; and, at his warning,
328	Whether in sea or fire, in earth or air,
329	The extravagant and erring spirit hies
330	To his confine: and of the truth herein
331	This present object made probation.
332	
333	MARCELLUS	It faded on the crowing of the cock.
334	Some say that ever 'gainst that season comes
335	Wherein our Saviour's birth is celebrated,
336	The bird of dawning singeth all night long:
337	And then, they say, no spirit dares stir abroad;
338	The nights are wholesome; then no planets strike,
339	No fairy takes, nor witch hath power to charm,
340	So hallow'd and so gracious is the time.
341	
342	HORATIO	So have I heard and do in part believe it.
343	But, look, the morn, in russet mantle clad,
344	Walks o'er the dew of yon high eastward hill:
345	Break we our watch up; and by my advice,
346	Let us impart what we have seen to-night
347	Unto young Hamlet; for, upon my life,
348	This spirit, dumb to us, will speak to him.
349	Do you consent we shall acquaint him with it,
350	As needful in our loves, fitting our duty?
351	
352	MARCELLUS	Let's do't, I pray; and I this morning know
353	Where we shall find him most conveniently.
354	
355	[Exeunt]
356	
357

359	
360	HAMLET
361	
362	
363	ACT I
364	
365	
366	
367	SCENE II	A room of state in the castle.
368	
369	
370	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, HAMLET,
371	POLONIUS, LAERTES, VOLTIMAND, CORNELIUS, Lords,
372	and Attendants]
373	
374	KING CLAUDIUS	Though yet of Hamlet our dear brother's death
375	The memory be green, and that it us befitted
376	To bear our hearts in grief and our whole kingdom
377	To be contracted in one brow of woe,
378	Yet so far hath discretion fought with nature
379	That we with wisest sorrow think on him,
380	Together with remembrance of ourselves.
381	Therefore our sometime sister, now our queen,
382	The imperial jointress to this warlike state,
383	Have we, as 'twere with a defeated joy,--
384	With an auspicious and a dropping eye,
385	With mirth in funeral and with dirge in marriage,
386	In equal scale weighing delight and dole,--
387	Taken to wife: nor have we herein barr'd
388	Your better wisdoms, which have freely gone
389	With this affair along. For all, our thanks.
390	Now follows, that you know, young Fortinbras,
391	Holding a weak supposal of our worth,
392	Or thinking by our late dear brother's death
393	Our state to be disjoint and out of frame,
394	Colleagued with the dream of his advantage,
395	He hath not fail'd to pester us with message,
396	Importing the surrender of those lands
397	Lost by his father, with all bonds of law,
398	To our most valiant brother. So much for him.
399	Now for ourself and for this time of meeting:
400	Thus much the business is: we have here writ
401	To Norway, uncle of young Fortinbras,--
402	Who, impotent and bed-rid, scarcely hears
403	Of this his nephew's purpose,--to suppress
404	His further gait herein; in that the levies,
405	The lists and full proportions, are all made
406	Out of his subject: and we here dispatch
407	You, good Cornelius, and you, Voltimand,
408	For bearers of this greeting to old Norway;
409	Giving to you no further personal power
410	To business with the king, more than the scope
411	Of these delated articles allow.
412	Farewell, and let your haste commend your duty.
413	
414	
415	CORNELIUS	|
416	|  In that and all things will we show our duty.
417	VOLTIMAND	|
418	
419	
420	KING CLAUDIUS	We doubt it nothing: heartily farewell.
421	
422	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
423	
424	And now, Laertes, what's the news with you?
425	You told us of some suit; what is't, Laertes?
426	You cannot speak of reason to the Dane,
427	And loose your voice: what wouldst thou beg, Laertes,
428	That shall not be my offer, not thy asking?
429	The head is not more native to the heart,
430	The hand more instrumental to the mouth,
431	Than is the throne of Denmark to thy father.
432	What wouldst thou have, Laertes?
433	
434	LAERTES	My dread lord,
435	Your leave and favour to return to France;
436	From whence though willingly I came to Denmark,
437	To show my duty in your coronation,
438	Yet now, I must confess, that duty done,
439	My thoughts and wishes bend again toward France
440	And bow them to your gracious leave and pardon.
441	
442	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you your father's leave? What says Polonius?
443	
444	LORD POLONIUS	He hath, my lord, wrung from me my slow leave
445	By laboursome petition, and at last
446	Upon his will I seal'd my hard consent:
447	I do beseech you, give him leave to go.
448	
449	KING CLAUDIUS	Take thy fair hour, Laertes; time be thine,
450	And thy best graces spend it at thy will!
451	But now, my cousin Hamlet, and my son,--
452	
453	HAMLET	[Aside]  A little more than kin, and less than kind.
454	
455	KING CLAUDIUS	How is it that the clouds still hang on you?
456	
457	HAMLET	Not so, my lord; I am too much i' the sun.
458	
459	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good Hamlet, cast thy nighted colour off,
460	And let thine eye look like a friend on Denmark.
461	Do not for ever with thy vailed lids
462	Seek for thy noble father in the dust:
463	Thou know'st 'tis common; all that lives must die,
464	Passing through nature to eternity.
465	
466	HAMLET	Ay, madam, it is common.
467	
468	QUEEN GERTRUDE	If it be,
469	Why seems it so particular with thee?
470	
471	HAMLET	Seems, madam! nay it is; I know not 'seems.'
472	'Tis not alone my inky cloak, good mother,
473	Nor customary suits of solemn black,
474	Nor windy suspiration of forced breath,
475	No, nor the fruitful river in the eye,
476	Nor the dejected 'havior of the visage,
477	Together with all forms, moods, shapes of grief,
478	That can denote me truly: these indeed seem,
479	For they are actions that a man might play:
480	But I have that within which passeth show;
481	These but the trappings and the suits of woe.
482	
483	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis sweet and commendable in your nature, Hamlet,
484	To give these mourning duties to your father:
485	But, you must know, your father lost a father;
486	That father lost, lost his, and the survivor bound
487	In filial obligation for some term
488	To do obsequious sorrow: but to persever
489	In obstinate condolement is a course
490	Of impious stubbornness; 'tis unmanly grief;
491	It shows a will most incorrect to heaven,
492	A heart unfortified, a mind impatient,
493	An understanding simple and unschool'd:
494	For what we know must be and is as common
495	As any the most vulgar thing to sense,
496	Why should we in our peevish opposition
497	Take it to heart? Fie! 'tis a fault to heaven,
498	A fault against the dead, a fault to nature,
499	To reason most absurd: whose common theme
500	Is death of fathers, and who still hath cried,
501	From the first corse till he that died to-day,
502	'This must be so.' We pray you, throw to earth
503	This unprevailing woe, and think of us
504	As of a father: for let the world take note,
505	You are the most immediate to our throne;
506	And with no less nobility of love
507	Than that which dearest father bears his son,
508	Do I impart toward you. For your intent
509	In going back to school in Wittenberg,
510	It is most retrograde to our desire:
511	And we beseech you, bend you to remain
512	Here, in the cheer and comfort of our eye,
513	Our chiefest courtier, cousin, and our son.
514	
515	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Let not thy mother lose her prayers, Hamlet:
516	I pray thee, stay with us; go not to Wittenberg.
517	
518	HAMLET	I shall in all my best obey you, madam.
519	
520	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, 'tis a loving and a fair reply:
521	Be as ourself in Denmark. Madam, come;
522	This gentle and unforced accord of Hamlet
523	Sits smiling to my heart: in grace whereof,
524	No jocund health that Denmark drinks to-day,
525	But the great cannon to the clouds shall tell,
526	And the king's rouse the heavens all bruit again,
527	Re-speaking earthly thunder. Come away.
528	
529	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]
530	
531	HAMLET	O, that this too too solid flesh would melt
532	Thaw and resolve itself into a dew!
533	Or that the Everlasting had not fix'd
534	His canon 'gainst self-slaughter! O God! God!
535	How weary, stale, flat and unprofitable,
536	Seem to me all the uses of this world!
537	Fie on't! ah fie! 'tis an unweeded garden,
538	That grows to seed; things rank and gross in nature
539	Possess it merely. That it should come to this!
540	But two months dead: nay, not so much, not two:
541	So excellent a king; that was, to this,
542	Hyperion to a satyr; so loving to my mother
543	That he might not beteem the winds of heaven
544	Visit her face too roughly. Heaven and earth!
545	Must I remember? why, she would hang on him,
546	As if increase of appetite had grown
547	By what it fed on: and yet, within a month--
548	Let me not think on't--Frailty, thy name is woman!--
549	A little month, or ere those shoes were old
550	With which she follow'd my poor father's body,
551	Like Niobe, all tears:--why she, even she--
552	O, God! a beast, that wants discourse of reason,
553	Would have mourn'd longer--married with my uncle,
554	My father's brother, but no more like my father
555	Than I to Hercules: within a month:
556	Ere yet the salt of most unrighteous tears
557	Had left the flushing in her galled eyes,
558	She married. O, most wicked speed, to post
559	With such dexterity to incestuous sheets!
560	It is not nor it cannot come to good:
561	But break, my heart; for I must hold my tongue.
562	
563	[Enter HORATIO, MARCELLUS, and BERNARDO]
564	
565	HORATIO	Hail to your lordship!
566	
567	HAMLET	I am glad to see you well:
568	Horatio,--or I do forget myself.
569	
570	HORATIO	The same, my lord, and your poor servant ever.
571	
572	HAMLET	Sir, my good friend; I'll change that name with you:
573	And what make you from Wittenberg, Horatio? Marcellus?
574	
575	MARCELLUS	My good lord--
576	
577	HAMLET	I am very glad to see you. Good even, sir.
578	But what, in faith, make you from Wittenberg?
579	
580	HORATIO	A truant disposition, good my lord.
581	
582	HAMLET	I would not hear your enemy say so,
583	Nor shall you do mine ear that violence,
584	To make it truster of your own report
585	Against yourself: I know you are no truant.
586	But what is your affair in Elsinore?
587	We'll teach you to drink deep ere you depart.
588	
589	HORATIO	My lord, I came to see your father's funeral.
590	
591	HAMLET	I pray thee, do not mock me, fellow-student;
592	I think it was to see my mother's wedding.
593	
594	HORATIO	Indeed, my lord, it follow'd hard upon.
595	
596	HAMLET	Thrift, thrift, Horatio! the funeral baked meats
597	Did coldly furnish forth the marriage tables.
598	Would I had met my dearest foe in heaven
599	Or ever I had seen that day, Horatio!
600	My father!--methinks I see my father.
601	
602	HORATIO	Where, my lord?
603	
604	HAMLET	                  In my mind's eye, Horatio.
605	
606	HORATIO	I saw him once; he was a goodly king.
607	
608	HAMLET	He was a man, take him for all in all,
609	I shall not look upon his like again.
610	
611	HORATIO	My lord, I think I saw him yesternight.
612	
613	HAMLET	Saw? who?
614	
615	HORATIO	My lord, the king your father.
616	
617	HAMLET	The king my father!
618	
619	HORATIO	Season your admiration for awhile
620	With an attent ear, till I may deliver,
621	Upon the witness of these gentlemen,
622	This marvel to you.
623	
624	HAMLET	For God's love, let me hear.
625	
626	HORATIO	Two nights together had these gentlemen,
627	Marcellus and Bernardo, on their watch,
628	In the dead vast and middle of the night,
629	Been thus encounter'd. A figure like your father,
630	Armed at point exactly, cap-a-pe,
631	Appears before them, and with solemn march
632	Goes slow and stately by them: thrice he walk'd
633	By their oppress'd and fear-surprised eyes,
634	Within his truncheon's length; whilst they, distilled
635	Almost to jelly with the act of fear,
636	Stand dumb and speak not to him. This to me
637	In dreadful secrecy impart they did;
638	And I with them the third night kept the watch;
639	Where, as they had deliver'd, both in time,
640	Form of the thing, each word made true and good,
641	The apparition comes: I knew your father;
642	These hands are not more like.
643	
644	HAMLET	But where was this?
645	
646	MARCELLUS	My lord, upon the platform where we watch'd.
647	
648	HAMLET	Did you not speak to it?
649	
650	HORATIO	My lord, I did;
651	But answer made it none: yet once methought
652	It lifted up its head and did address
653	Itself to motion, like as it would speak;
654	But even then the morning cock crew loud,
655	And at the sound it shrunk in haste away,
656	And vanish'd from our sight.
657	
658	HAMLET	'Tis very strange.
659	
660	HORATIO	As I do live, my honour'd lord, 'tis true;
661	And we did think it writ down in our duty
662	To let you know of it.
663	
664	HAMLET	Indeed, indeed, sirs, but this troubles me.
665	Hold you the watch to-night?
666	
667	
668	MARCELLUS	|
669	|	We do, my lord.
670	BERNARDO	|
671	
672	
673	HAMLET	Arm'd, say you?
674	
675	
676	MARCELLUS	|
677	|  Arm'd, my lord.
678	BERNARDO	|
679	
680	
681	HAMLET	From top to toe?
682	
683	
684	MARCELLUS	|
685	|             My lord, from head to foot.
686	BERNARDO	|
687	
688	
689	HAMLET	Then saw you not his face?
690	
691	HORATIO	O, yes, my lord; he wore his beaver up.
692	
693	HAMLET	What, look'd he frowningly?
694	
695	HORATIO	A countenance more in sorrow than in anger.
696	
697	HAMLET	Pale or red?
698	
699	HORATIO	Nay, very pale.
700	
701	HAMLET	                  And fix'd his eyes upon you?
702	
703	HORATIO	Most constantly.
704	
705	HAMLET	                  I would I had been there.
706	
707	HORATIO	It would have much amazed you.
708	
709	HAMLET	Very like, very like. Stay'd it long?
710	
711	HORATIO	While one with moderate haste might tell a hundred.
712	
713	
714	MARCELLUS	|
715	| Longer, longer.
716	BERNARDO	|
717	
718	
719	HORATIO	Not when I saw't.
720	
721	HAMLET	                  His beard was grizzled--no?
722	
723	HORATIO	It was, as I have seen it in his life,
724	A sable silver'd.
725	
726	HAMLET	                  I will watch to-night;
727	Perchance 'twill walk again.
728	
729	HORATIO	I warrant it will.
730	
731	HAMLET	If it assume my noble father's person,
732	I'll speak to it, though hell itself should gape
733	And bid me hold my peace. I pray you all,
734	If you have hitherto conceal'd this sight,
735	Let it be tenable in your silence still;
736	And whatsoever else shall hap to-night,
737	Give it an understanding, but no tongue:
738	I will requite your loves. So, fare you well:
739	Upon the platform, 'twixt eleven and twelve,
740	I'll visit you.
741	
742	All	                  Our duty to your honour.
743	
744	HAMLET	Your loves, as mine to you: farewell.
745	
746	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]
747	
748	My father's spirit in arms! all is not well;
749	I doubt some foul play: would the night were come!
750	Till then sit still, my soul: foul deeds will rise,
751	Though all the earth o'erwhelm them, to men's eyes.
752	
753	[Exit]

758	HAMLET
759	
760	
761	ACT I
762	
763	
764	
765	SCENE III	A room in Polonius' house.
766	
767	
768	[Enter LAERTES and OPHELIA]
769	
770	LAERTES	My necessaries are embark'd: farewell:
771	And, sister, as the winds give benefit
772	And convoy is assistant, do not sleep,
773	But let me hear from you.
774	
775	OPHELIA	Do you doubt that?
776	
777	LAERTES	For Hamlet and the trifling of his favour,
778	Hold it a fashion and a toy in blood,
779	A violet in the youth of primy nature,
780	Forward, not permanent, sweet, not lasting,
781	The perfume and suppliance of a minute; No more.
782	
783	OPHELIA	       No more but so?
784	
785	LAERTES	Think it no more;
786	For nature, crescent, does not grow alone
787	In thews and bulk, but, as this temple waxes,
788	The inward service of the mind and soul
789	Grows wide withal. Perhaps he loves you now,
790	And now no soil nor cautel doth besmirch
791	The virtue of his will: but you must fear,
792	His greatness weigh'd, his will is not his own;
793	For he himself is subject to his birth:
794	He may not, as unvalued persons do,
795	Carve for himself; for on his choice depends
796	The safety and health of this whole state;
797	And therefore must his choice be circumscribed
798	Unto the voice and yielding of that body
799	Whereof he is the head. Then if he says he loves you,
800	It fits your wisdom so far to believe it
801	As he in his particular act and place
802	May give his saying deed; which is no further
803	Than the main voice of Denmark goes withal.
804	Then weigh what loss your honour may sustain,
805	If with too credent ear you list his songs,
806	Or lose your heart, or your chaste treasure open
807	To his unmaster'd importunity.
808	Fear it, Ophelia, fear it, my dear sister,
809	And keep you in the rear of your affection,
810	Out of the shot and danger of desire.
811	The chariest maid is prodigal enough,
812	If she unmask her beauty to the moon:
813	Virtue itself 'scapes not calumnious strokes:
814	The canker galls the infants of the spring,
815	Too oft before their buttons be disclosed,
816	And in the morn and liquid dew of youth
817	Contagious blastments are most imminent.
818	Be wary then; best safety lies in fear:
819	Youth to itself rebels, though none else near.
820	
821	OPHELIA	I shall the effect of this good lesson keep,
822	As watchman to my heart. But, good my brother,
823	Do not, as some ungracious pastors do,
824	Show me the steep and thorny way to heaven;
825	Whiles, like a puff'd and reckless libertine,
826	Himself the primrose path of dalliance treads,
827	And recks not his own rede.
828	
829	LAERTES	O, fear me not.
830	I stay too long: but here my father comes.
831	
832	[Enter POLONIUS]
833	
834	A double blessing is a double grace,
835	Occasion smiles upon a second leave.
836	
837	LORD POLONIUS	Yet here, Laertes! aboard, aboard, for shame!
838	The wind sits in the shoulder of your sail,
839	And you are stay'd for. There; my blessing with thee!
840	And these few precepts in thy memory
841	See thou character. Give thy thoughts no tongue,
842	Nor any unproportioned thought his act.
843	Be thou familiar, but by no means vulgar.
844	Those friends thou hast, and their adoption tried,
845	Grapple them to thy soul with hoops of steel;
846	But do not dull thy palm with entertainment
847	Of each new-hatch'd, unfledged comrade. Beware
848	Of entrance to a quarrel, but being in,
849	Bear't that the opposed may beware of thee.
850	Give every man thy ear, but few thy voice;
851	Take each man's censure, but reserve thy judgment.
852	Costly thy habit as thy purse can buy,
853	But not express'd in fancy; rich, not gaudy;
854	For the apparel oft proclaims the man,
855	And they in France of the best rank and station
856	Are of a most select and generous chief in that.
857	Neither a borrower nor a lender be;
858	For loan oft loses both itself and friend,
859	And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry.
860	This above all: to thine ownself be true,
861	And it must follow, as the night the day,
862	Thou canst not then be false to any man.
863	Farewell: my blessing season this in thee!
864	
865	LAERTES	Most humbly do I take my leave, my lord.
866	
867	LORD POLONIUS	The time invites you; go; your servants tend.
868	
869	LAERTES	Farewell, Ophelia; and remember well
870	What I have said to you.
871	
872	OPHELIA	'Tis in my memory lock'd,
873	And you yourself shall keep the key of it.
874	
875	LAERTES	Farewell.
876	
877	[Exit]
878	
879	LORD POLONIUS	What is't, Ophelia, be hath said to you?
880	
881	OPHELIA	So please you, something touching the Lord Hamlet.
882	
883	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well bethought:
884	'Tis told me, he hath very oft of late
885	Given private time to you; and you yourself
886	Have of your audience been most free and bounteous:
887	If it be so, as so 'tis put on me,
888	And that in way of caution, I must tell you,
889	You do not understand yourself so clearly
890	As it behoves my daughter and your honour.
891	What is between you? give me up the truth.
892	
893	OPHELIA	He hath, my lord, of late made many tenders
894	Of his affection to me.
895	
896	LORD POLONIUS	Affection! pooh! you speak like a green girl,
897	Unsifted in such perilous circumstance.
898	Do you believe his tenders, as you call them?
899	
900	OPHELIA	I do not know, my lord, what I should think.
901	
902	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, I'll teach you: think yourself a baby;
903	That you have ta'en these tenders for true pay,
904	Which are not sterling. Tender yourself more dearly;
905	Or--not to crack the wind of the poor phrase,
906	Running it thus--you'll tender me a fool.
907	
908	OPHELIA	My lord, he hath importuned me with love
909	In honourable fashion.
910	
911	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, fashion you may call it; go to, go to.
912	
913	OPHELIA	And hath given countenance to his speech, my lord,
914	With almost all the holy vows of heaven.
915	
916	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, springes to catch woodcocks. I do know,
917	When the blood burns, how prodigal the soul
918	Lends the tongue vows: these blazes, daughter,
919	Giving more light than heat, extinct in both,
920	Even in their promise, as it is a-making,
921	You must not take for fire. From this time
922	Be somewhat scanter of your maiden presence;
923	Set your entreatments at a higher rate
924	Than a command to parley. For Lord Hamlet,
925	Believe so much in him, that he is young
926	And with a larger tether may he walk
927	Than may be given you: in few, Ophelia,
928	Do not believe his vows; for they are brokers,
929	Not of that dye which their investments show,
930	But mere implorators of unholy suits,
931	Breathing like sanctified and pious bawds,
932	The better to beguile. This is for all:
933	I would not, in plain terms, from this time forth,
934	Have you so slander any moment leisure,
935	As to give words or talk with the Lord Hamlet.
936	Look to't, I charge you: come your ways.
937	
938	OPHELIA	I shall obey, my lord.
939	
940	[Exeunt]
941	
942	
943	
944	
945	HAMLET
946	
947	
948	ACT I
949	
950	
951	
952	SCENE IV	The platform.
953	
954	
955	[Enter HAMLET, HORATIO, and MARCELLUS]
956	
957	HAMLET	The air bites shrewdly; it is very cold.
958	
959	HORATIO	It is a nipping and an eager air.
960	
961	HAMLET	What hour now?
962	
963	HORATIO	                  I think it lacks of twelve.
964	
965	HAMLET	No, it is struck.
966	
967	HORATIO	Indeed? I heard it not: then it draws near the season
968	Wherein the spirit held his wont to walk.
969	
970	[A flourish of trumpets, and ordnance shot off, within]
971	
972	What does this mean, my lord?
973	
974	HAMLET	The king doth wake to-night and takes his rouse,
975	Keeps wassail, and the swaggering up-spring reels;
976	And, as he drains his draughts of Rhenish down,
977	The kettle-drum and trumpet thus bray out
978	The triumph of his pledge.
979	
980	HORATIO	Is it a custom?
981	
982	HAMLET	Ay, marry, is't:
983	But to my mind, though I am native here
984	And to the manner born, it is a custom
985	More honour'd in the breach than the observance.
986	This heavy-headed revel east and west
987	Makes us traduced and tax'd of other nations:
988	They clepe us drunkards, and with swinish phrase
989	Soil our addition; and indeed it takes
990	From our achievements, though perform'd at height,
991	The pith and marrow of our attribute.
992	So, oft it chances in particular men,
993	That for some vicious mole of nature in them,
994	As, in their birth--wherein they are not guilty,
995	Since nature cannot choose his origin--
996	By the o'ergrowth of some complexion,
997	Oft breaking down the pales and forts of reason,
998	Or by some habit that too much o'er-leavens
999	The form of plausive manners, that these men,
1000	Carrying, I say, the stamp of one defect,
1001	Being nature's livery, or fortune's star,--
1002	Their virtues else--be they as pure as grace,
1003	As infinite as man may undergo--
1004	Shall in the general censure take corruption
1005	From that particular fault: the dram of eale
1006	Doth all the noble substance of a doubt
1007	To his own scandal.
1008	
1009	HORATIO	Look, my lord, it comes!
1010	
1011	[Enter Ghost]
1012	
1013	HAMLET	Angels and ministers of grace defend us!
1014	Be thou a spirit of health or goblin damn'd,
1015	Bring with thee airs from heaven or blasts from hell,
1016	Be thy intents wicked or charitable,
1017	Thou comest in such a questionable shape
1018	That I will speak to thee: I'll call thee Hamlet,
1019	King, father, royal Dane: O, answer me!
1020	Let me not burst in ignorance; but tell
1021	Why thy canonized bones, hearsed in death,
1022	Have burst their cerements; why the sepulchre,
1023	Wherein we saw thee quietly inurn'd,
1024	Hath oped his ponderous and marble jaws,
1025	To cast thee up again. What may this mean,
1026	That thou, dead corse, again in complete steel
1027	Revisit'st thus the glimpses of the moon,
1028	Making night hideous; and we fools of nature
1029	So horridly to shake our disposition
1030	With thoughts beyond the reaches of our souls?
1031	Say, why is this? wherefore? what should we do?
1032	
1033	[Ghost beckons HAMLET]
1034	
1035	HORATIO	It beckons you to go away with it,
1036	As if it some impartment did desire
1037	To you alone.
1038	
1039	MARCELLUS	                  Look, with what courteous action
1040	It waves you to a more removed ground:
1041	But do not go with it.
1042	
1043	HORATIO	No, by no means.
1044	
1045	HAMLET	It will not speak; then I will follow it.
1046	
1047	HORATIO	Do not, my lord.
1048	
1049	HAMLET	                  Why, what should be the fear?
1050	I do not set my life in a pin's fee;
1051	And for my soul, what can it do to that,
1052	Being a thing immortal as itself?
1053	It waves me forth again: I'll follow it.
1054	
1055	HORATIO	What if it tempt you toward the flood, my lord,
1056	Or to the dreadful summit of the cliff
1057	That beetles o'er his base into the sea,
1058	And there assume some other horrible form,
1059	Which might deprive your sovereignty of reason
1060	And draw you into madness? think of it:
1061	The very place puts toys of desperation,
1062	Without more motive, into every brain
1063	That looks so many fathoms to the sea
1064	And hears it roar beneath.
1065	
1066	HAMLET	It waves me still.
1067	Go on; I'll follow thee.
1068	
1069	MARCELLUS	You shall not go, my lord.
1070	
1071	HAMLET	Hold off your hands.
1072	
1073	HORATIO	Be ruled; you shall not go.
1074	
1075	HAMLET	My fate cries out,
1076	And makes each petty artery in this body
1077	As hardy as the Nemean lion's nerve.
1078	Still am I call'd. Unhand me, gentlemen.
1079	By heaven, I'll make a ghost of him that lets me!
1080	I say, away! Go on; I'll follow thee.
1081	
1082	[Exeunt Ghost and HAMLET]
1083	
1084	HORATIO	He waxes desperate with imagination.
1085	
1086	MARCELLUS	Let's follow; 'tis not fit thus to obey him.
1087	
1088	HORATIO	Have after. To what issue will this come?
1089	
1090	MARCELLUS	Something is rotten in the state of Denmark.
1091	
1092	HORATIO	Heaven will direct it.
1093	
1094	MARCELLUS	Nay, let's follow him.
1095	
1096	[Exeunt]

1107	
1108	SCENE V	Another part of the platform.
1109	
1110	
1111	[Enter GHOST and HAMLET]
1112	
1113	HAMLET	Where wilt thou lead me? speak; I'll go no further.
1114	
1115	Ghost	Mark me.
1116	
1117	HAMLET	       I will.
1118	
1119	Ghost	                  My hour is almost come,
1120	When I to sulphurous and tormenting flames
1121	Must render up myself.
1122	
1123	HAMLET	Alas, poor ghost!
1124	
1125	Ghost	Pity me not, but lend thy serious hearing
1126	To what I shall unfold.
1127	
1128	HAMLET	Speak; I am bound to hear.
1129	
1130	Ghost	 So art thou to revenge, when thou shalt hear.
1131	
1132	HAMLET	What?
1133	
1134	Ghost	I am thy father's spirit,
1135	Doom'd for a certain term to walk the night,
1136	And for the day confined to fast in fires,
1137	Till the foul crimes done in my days of nature
1138	Are burnt and purged away. But that I am forbid
1139	To tell the secrets of my prison-house,
1140	I could a tale unfold whose lightest word
1141	Would harrow up thy soul, freeze thy young blood,
1142	Make thy two eyes, like stars, start from their spheres,
1143	Thy knotted and combined locks to part
1144	And each particular hair to stand on end,
1145	Like quills upon the fretful porpentine:
1146	But this eternal blazon must not be
1147	To ears of flesh and blood. List, list, O, list!
1148	If thou didst ever thy dear father love--
1149	
1150	HAMLET	O God!
1151	
1152	Ghost	Revenge his foul and most unnatural murder.
1153	
1154	HAMLET	Murder!
1155	
1156	Ghost	Murder most foul, as in the best it is;
1157	But this most foul, strange and unnatural.
1158	
1159	HAMLET	Haste me to know't, that I, with wings as swift
1160	As meditation or the thoughts of love,
1161	May sweep to my revenge.
1162	
1163	Ghost	I find thee apt;
1164	And duller shouldst thou be than the fat weed
1165	That roots itself in ease on Lethe wharf,
1166	Wouldst thou not stir in this. Now, Hamlet, hear:
1167	'Tis given out that, sleeping in my orchard,
1168	A serpent stung me; so the whole ear of Denmark
1169	Is by a forged process of my death
1170	Rankly abused: but know, thou noble youth,
1171	The serpent that did sting thy father's life
1172	Now wears his crown.
1173	
1174	HAMLET	O my prophetic soul! My uncle!
1175	
1176	Ghost	Ay, that incestuous, that adulterate beast,
1177	With witchcraft of his wit, with traitorous gifts,--
1178	O wicked wit and gifts, that have the power
1179	So to seduce!--won to his shameful lust
1180	The will of my most seeming-virtuous queen:
1181	O Hamlet, what a falling-off was there!
1182	From me, whose love was of that dignity
1183	That it went hand in hand even with the vow
1184	I made to her in marriage, and to decline
1185	Upon a wretch whose natural gifts were poor
1186	To those of mine!
1187	But virtue, as it never will be moved,
1188	Though lewdness court it in a shape of heaven,
1189	So lust, though to a radiant angel link'd,
1190	Will sate itself in a celestial bed,
1191	And prey on garbage.
1192	But, soft! methinks I scent the morning air;
1193	Brief let me be. Sleeping within my orchard,
1194	My custom always of the afternoon,
1195	Upon my secure hour thy uncle stole,
1196	With juice of cursed hebenon in a vial,
1197	And in the porches of my ears did pour
1198	The leperous distilment; whose effect
1199	Holds such an enmity with blood of man
1200	That swift as quicksilver it courses through
1201	The natural gates and alleys of the body,
1202	And with a sudden vigour doth posset
1203	And curd, like eager droppings into milk,
1204	The thin and wholesome blood: so did it mine;
1205	And a most instant tetter bark'd about,
1206	Most lazar-like, with vile and loathsome crust,
1207	All my smooth body.
1208	Thus was I, sleeping, by a brother's hand
1209	Of life, of crown, of queen, at once dispatch'd:
1210	Cut off even in the blossoms of my sin,
1211	Unhousel'd, disappointed, unanel'd,
1212	No reckoning made, but sent to my account
1213	With all my imperfections on my head:
1214	O, horrible! O, horrible! most horrible!
1215	If thou hast nature in thee, bear it not;
1216	Let not the royal bed of Denmark be
1217	A couch for luxury and damned incest.
1218	But, howsoever thou pursuest this act,
1219	Taint not thy mind, nor let thy soul contrive
1220	Against thy mother aught: leave her to heaven
1221	And to those thorns that in her bosom lodge,
1222	To prick and sting her. Fare thee well at once!
1223	The glow-worm shows the matin to be near,
1224	And 'gins to pale his uneffectual fire:
1225	Adieu, adieu! Hamlet, remember me.
1226	
1227	[Exit]
1228	
1229	HAMLET	O all you host of heaven! O earth! what else?
1230	And shall I couple hell? O, fie! Hold, hold, my heart;
1231	And you, my sinews, grow not instant old,
1232	But bear me stiffly up. Remember thee!
1233	Ay, thou poor ghost, while memory holds a seat
1234	In this distracted globe. Remember thee!
1235	Yea, from the table of my memory
1236	I'll wipe away all trivial fond records,
1237	All saws of books, all forms, all pressures past,
1238	That youth and observation copied there;
1239	And thy commandment all alone shall live
1240	Within the book and volume of my brain,
1241	Unmix'd with baser matter: yes, by heaven!
1242	O most pernicious woman!
1243	O villain, villain, smiling, damned villain!
1244	My tables,--meet it is I set it down,
1245	That one may smile, and smile, and be a villain;
1246	At least I'm sure it may be so in Denmark:
1247	
1248	[Writing]
1249	
1250	So, uncle, there you are. Now to my word;
1251	It is 'Adieu, adieu! remember me.'
1252	I have sworn 't.
1253	
1254	
1255	MARCELLUS	|
1256	| [Within]  My lord, my lord,--
1257	HORATIO	|
1258	
1259	
1260	MARCELLUS	[Within]	Lord Hamlet,--
1261	
1262	HORATIO	[Within]	Heaven secure him!
1263	
1264	HAMLET	So be it!
1265	
1266	HORATIO	[Within]  Hillo, ho, ho, my lord!
1267	
1268	HAMLET	Hillo, ho, ho, boy! come, bird, come.
1269	
1270	[Enter HORATIO and MARCELLUS]
1271	
1272	MARCELLUS	How is't, my noble lord?
1273	
1274	HORATIO	What news, my lord?
1275	
1276	HAMLET	O, wonderful!
1277	
1278	HORATIO	                  Good my lord, tell it.
1279	
1280	HAMLET	No; you'll reveal it.
1281	
1282	HORATIO	Not I, my lord, by heaven.
1283	
1284	MARCELLUS	Nor I, my lord.
1285	
1286	HAMLET	How say you, then; would heart of man once think it?
1287	But you'll be secret?
1288	
1289	
1290	HORATIO	|
1291	|                   Ay, by heaven, my lord.
1292	MARCELLUS	|
1293	
1294	
1295	HAMLET	There's ne'er a villain dwelling in all Denmark
1296	But he's an arrant knave.
1297	
1298	HORATIO	There needs no ghost, my lord, come from the grave
1299	To tell us this.
1300	
1301	HAMLET	                  Why, right; you are i' the right;
1302	And so, without more circumstance at all,
1303	I hold it fit that we shake hands and part:
1304	You, as your business and desire shall point you;
1305	For every man has business and desire,
1306	Such as it is; and for mine own poor part,
1307	Look you, I'll go pray.
1308	
1309	HORATIO	These are but wild and whirling words, my lord.
1310	
1311	HAMLET	I'm sorry they offend you, heartily;
1312	Yes, 'faith heartily.
1313	
1314	HORATIO	There's no offence, my lord.
1315	
1316	HAMLET	Yes, by Saint Patrick, but there is, Horatio,
1317	And much offence too. Touching this vision here,
1318	It is an honest ghost, that let me tell you:
1319	For your desire to know what is between us,
1320	O'ermaster 't as you may. And now, good friends,
1321	As you are friends, scholars and soldiers,
1322	Give me one poor request.
1323	
1324	HORATIO	What is't, my lord? we will.
1325	
1326	HAMLET	Never make known what you have seen to-night.
1327	
1328	
1329	HORATIO	|
1330	| My lord, we will not.
1331	MARCELLUS	|
1332	
1333	
1334	HAMLET	Nay, but swear't.
1335	
1336	HORATIO	In faith,
1337	My lord, not I.
1338	
1339	MARCELLUS	                  Nor I, my lord, in faith.
1340	
1341	HAMLET	Upon my sword.
1342	
1343	MARCELLUS	                  We have sworn, my lord, already.
1344	
1345	HAMLET	Indeed, upon my sword, indeed.
1346	
1347	Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
1348	
1349	HAMLET	Ah, ha, boy! say'st thou so? art thou there,
1350	truepenny?
1351	Come on--you hear this fellow in the cellarage--
1352	Consent to swear.
1353	
1354	HORATIO	                  Propose the oath, my lord.
1355	
1356	HAMLET	Never to speak of this that you have seen,
1357	Swear by my sword.
1358	
1359	Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
1360	
1361	HAMLET	Hic et ubique? then we'll shift our ground.
1362	Come hither, gentlemen,
1363	And lay your hands again upon my sword:
1364	Never to speak of this that you have heard,
1365	Swear by my sword.
1366	
1367	Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
1368	
1369	HAMLET	Well said, old mole! canst work i' the earth so fast?
1370	A worthy pioner! Once more remove, good friends.
1371	
1372	HORATIO	O day and night, but this is wondrous strange!
1373	
1374	HAMLET	And therefore as a stranger give it welcome.
1375	There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,
1376	Than are dreamt of in your philosophy. But come;
1377	Here, as before, never, so help you mercy,
1378	How strange or odd soe'er I bear myself,
1379	As I perchance hereafter shall think meet
1380	To put an antic disposition on,
1381	That you, at such times seeing me, never shall,
1382	With arms encumber'd thus, or this headshake,
1383	Or by pronouncing of some doubtful phrase,
1384	As 'Well, well, we know,' or 'We could, an if we would,'
1385	Or 'If we list to speak,' or 'There be, an if they might,'
1386	Or such ambiguous giving out, to note
1387	That you know aught of me: this not to do,
1388	So grace and mercy at your most need help you, Swear.
1389	
1390	Ghost	[Beneath]  Swear.
1391	
1392	HAMLET	Rest, rest, perturbed spirit!
1393	
1394	[They swear]
1395	
1396	So, gentlemen,
1397	With all my love I do commend me to you:
1398	And what so poor a man as Hamlet is
1399	May do, to express his love and friending to you,
1400	God willing, shall not lack. Let us go in together;
1401	And still your fingers on your lips, I pray.
1402	The time is out of joint: O cursed spite,
1403	That ever I was born to set it right!
1404	Nay, come, let's go together.
1405	
1406	[Exeunt]

1414	ACT II
1415	
1416	
1417	
1418	SCENE I	A room in POLONIUS' house.
1419	
1420	
1421	[Enter POLONIUS and REYNALDO]
1422	
1423	LORD POLONIUS	Give him this money and these notes, Reynaldo.
1424	
1425	REYNALDO	I will, my lord.
1426	
1427	LORD POLONIUS	You shall do marvellous wisely, good Reynaldo,
1428	Before you visit him, to make inquire
1429	Of his behavior.
1430	
1431	REYNALDO	                  My lord, I did intend it.
1432	
1433	LORD POLONIUS	Marry, well said; very well said. Look you, sir,
1434	Inquire me first what Danskers are in Paris;
1435	And how, and who, what means, and where they keep,
1436	What company, at what expense; and finding
1437	By this encompassment and drift of question
1438	That they do know my son, come you more nearer
1439	Than your particular demands will touch it:
1440	Take you, as 'twere, some distant knowledge of him;
1441	As thus, 'I know his father and his friends,
1442	And in part him: ' do you mark this, Reynaldo?
1443	
1444	REYNALDO	Ay, very well, my lord.
1445	
1446	LORD POLONIUS	'And in part him; but' you may say 'not well:
1447	But, if't be he I mean, he's very wild;
1448	Addicted so and so:' and there put on him
1449	What forgeries you please; marry, none so rank
1450	As may dishonour him; take heed of that;
1451	But, sir, such wanton, wild and usual slips
1452	As are companions noted and most known
1453	To youth and liberty.
1454	
1455	REYNALDO	As gaming, my lord.
1456	
1457	LORD POLONIUS	Ay, or drinking, fencing, swearing, quarrelling,
1458	Drabbing: you may go so far.
1459	
1460	REYNALDO	My lord, that would dishonour him.
1461	
1462	LORD POLONIUS	'Faith, no; as you may season it in the charge
1463	You must not put another scandal on him,
1464	That he is open to incontinency;
1465	That's not my meaning: but breathe his faults so quaintly
1466	That they may seem the taints of liberty,
1467	The flash and outbreak of a fiery mind,
1468	A savageness in unreclaimed blood,
1469	Of general assault.
1470	
1471	REYNALDO	But, my good lord,--
1472	
1473	LORD POLONIUS	Wherefore should you do this?
1474	
1475	REYNALDO	Ay, my lord,
1476	I would know that.
1477	
1478	LORD POLONIUS	                  Marry, sir, here's my drift;
1479	And I believe, it is a fetch of wit:
1480	You laying these slight sullies on my son,
1481	As 'twere a thing a little soil'd i' the working, Mark you,
1482	Your party in converse, him you would sound,
1483	Having ever seen in the prenominate crimes
1484	The youth you breathe of guilty, be assured
1485	He closes with you in this consequence;
1486	'Good sir,' or so, or 'friend,' or 'gentleman,'
1487	According to the phrase or the addition
1488	Of man and country.
1489	
1490	REYNALDO	Very good, my lord.
1491	
1492	LORD POLONIUS	And then, sir, does he this--he does--what was I
1493	about to say? By the mass, I was about to say
1494	something: where did I leave?
1495	
1496	REYNALDO	At 'closes in the consequence,' at 'friend or so,'
1497	and 'gentleman.'
1498	
1499	LORD POLONIUS	At 'closes in the consequence,' ay, marry;
1500	He closes thus: 'I know the gentleman;
1501	I saw him yesterday, or t' other day,
1502	Or then, or then; with such, or such; and, as you say,
1503	There was a' gaming; there o'ertook in's rouse;
1504	There falling out at tennis:' or perchance,
1505	'I saw him enter such a house of sale,'
1506	Videlicet, a brothel, or so forth.
1507	See you now;
1508	Your bait of falsehood takes this carp of truth:
1509	And thus do we of wisdom and of reach,
1510	With windlasses and with assays of bias,
1511	By indirections find directions out:
1512	So by my former lecture and advice,
1513	Shall you my son. You have me, have you not?
1514	
1515	REYNALDO	My lord, I have.
1516	
1517	LORD POLONIUS	                  God be wi' you; fare you well.
1518	
1519	REYNALDO	Good my lord!
1520	
1521	LORD POLONIUS	Observe his inclination in yourself.
1522	
1523	REYNALDO	I shall, my lord.
1524	
1525	LORD POLONIUS	And let him ply his music.
1526	
1527	REYNALDO	Well, my lord.
1528	
1529	LORD POLONIUS	Farewell!
1530	
1531	[Exit REYNALDO]
1532	
1533	[Enter OPHELIA]
1534	
1535	How now, Ophelia! what's the matter?
1536	
1537	OPHELIA	O, my lord, my lord, I have been so affrighted!
1538	
1539	LORD POLONIUS	With what, i' the name of God?
1540	
1541	OPHELIA	My lord, as I was sewing in my closet,
1542	Lord Hamlet, with his doublet all unbraced;
1543	No hat upon his head; his stockings foul'd,
1544	Ungarter'd, and down-gyved to his ancle;
1545	Pale as his shirt; his knees knocking each other;
1546	And with a look so piteous in purport
1547	As if he had been loosed out of hell
1548	To speak of horrors,--he comes before me.
1549	
1550	LORD POLONIUS	Mad for thy love?
1551	
1552	OPHELIA	                  My lord, I do not know;
1553	But truly, I do fear it.
1554	
1555	LORD POLONIUS	What said he?
1556	
1557	OPHELIA	He took me by the wrist and held me hard;
1558	Then goes he to the length of all his arm;
1559	And, with his other hand thus o'er his brow,
1560	He falls to such perusal of my face
1561	As he would draw it. Long stay'd he so;
1562	At last, a little shaking of mine arm
1563	And thrice his head thus waving up and down,
1564	He raised a sigh so piteous and profound
1565	As it did seem to shatter all his bulk
1566	And end his being: that done, he lets me go:
1567	And, with his head over his shoulder turn'd,
1568	He seem'd to find his way without his eyes;
1569	For out o' doors he went without their helps,
1570	And, to the last, bended their light on me.
1571	
1572	LORD POLONIUS	Come, go with me: I will go seek the king.
1573	This is the very ecstasy of love,
1574	Whose violent property fordoes itself
1575	And leads the will to desperate undertakings
1576	As oft as any passion under heaven
1577	That does afflict our natures. I am sorry.
1578	What, have you given him any hard words of late?
1579	
1580	OPHELIA	No, my good lord, but, as you did command,
1581	I did repel his fetters and denied
1582	His access to me.
1583	
1584	LORD POLONIUS	                  That hath made him mad.
1585	I am sorry that with better heed and judgment
1586	I had not quoted him: I fear'd he did but trifle,
1587	And meant to wreck thee; but, beshrew my jealousy!
1588	By heaven, it is as proper to our age
1589	To cast beyond ourselves in our opinions
1590	As it is common for the younger sort
1591	To lack discretion. Come, go we to the king:
1592	This must be known; which, being kept close, might
1593	move
1594	More grief to hide than hate to utter love.
1595

1604	ACT II
1605	
1606	
1607	
1608	SCENE II	A room in the castle.
1609	
1610	
1611	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,
1612	GUILDENSTERN, and Attendants]
1613	
1614	KING CLAUDIUS	Welcome, dear Rosencrantz and Guildenstern!
1615	Moreover that we much did long to see you,
1616	The need we have to use you did provoke
1617	Our hasty sending. Something have you heard
1618	Of Hamlet's transformation; so call it,
1619	Sith nor the exterior nor the inward man
1620	Resembles that it was. What it should be,
1621	More than his father's death, that thus hath put him
1622	So much from the understanding of himself,
1623	I cannot dream of: I entreat you both,
1624	That, being of so young days brought up with him,
1625	And sith so neighbour'd to his youth and havior,
1626	That you vouchsafe your rest here in our court
1627	Some little time: so by your companies
1628	To draw him on to pleasures, and to gather,
1629	So much as from occasion you may glean,
1630	Whether aught, to us unknown, afflicts him thus,
1631	That, open'd, lies within our remedy.
1632	
1633	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Good gentlemen, he hath much talk'd of you;
1634	And sure I am two men there are not living
1635	To whom he more adheres. If it will please you
1636	To show us so much gentry and good will
1637	As to expend your time with us awhile,
1638	For the supply and profit of our hope,
1639	Your visitation shall receive such thanks
1640	As fits a king's remembrance.
1641	
1642	ROSENCRANTZ	Both your majesties
1643	Might, by the sovereign power you have of us,
1644	Put your dread pleasures more into command
1645	Than to entreaty.
1646	
1647	GUILDENSTERN	                  But we both obey,
1648	And here give up ourselves, in the full bent
1649	To lay our service freely at your feet,
1650	To be commanded.
1651	
1652	KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, Rosencrantz and gentle Guildenstern.
1653	
1654	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Thanks, Guildenstern and gentle Rosencrantz:
1655	And I beseech you instantly to visit
1656	My too much changed son. Go, some of you,
1657	And bring these gentlemen where Hamlet is.
1658	
1659	GUILDENSTERN	Heavens make our presence and our practises
1660	Pleasant and helpful to him!
1661	
1662	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay, amen!
1663	
1664	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ, GUILDENSTERN, and some
1665	Attendants]
1666	
1667	[Enter POLONIUS]
1668	
1669	LORD POLONIUS	The ambassadors from Norway, my good lord,
1670	Are joyfully return'd.
1671	
1672	KING CLAUDIUS	Thou still hast been the father of good news.
1673	
1674	LORD POLONIUS	Have I, my lord? I assure my good liege,
1675	I hold my duty, as I hold my soul,
1676	Both to my God and to my gracious king:
1677	And I do think, or else this brain of mine
1678	Hunts not the trail of policy so sure
1679	As it hath used to do, that I have found
1680	The very cause of Hamlet's lunacy.
1681	
1682	KING CLAUDIUS	O, speak of that; that do I long to hear.
1683	
1684	LORD POLONIUS	Give first admittance to the ambassadors;
1685	My news shall be the fruit to that great feast.
1686	
1687	KING CLAUDIUS	Thyself do grace to them, and bring them in.
1688	
1689	[Exit POLONIUS]
1690	
1691	He tells me, my dear Gertrude, he hath found
1692	The head and source of all your son's distemper.
1693	
1694	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I doubt it is no other but the main;
1695	His father's death, and our o'erhasty marriage.
1696	
1697	KING CLAUDIUS	Well, we shall sift him.
1698	
1699	[Re-enter POLONIUS, with VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
1700	
1701	Welcome, my good friends!
1702	Say, Voltimand, what from our brother Norway?
1703	
1704	VOLTIMAND	Most fair return of greetings and desires.
1705	Upon our first, he sent out to suppress
1706	His nephew's levies; which to him appear'd
1707	To be a preparation 'gainst the Polack;
1708	But, better look'd into, he truly found
1709	It was against your highness: whereat grieved,
1710	That so his sickness, age and impotence
1711	Was falsely borne in hand, sends out arrests
1712	On Fortinbras; which he, in brief, obeys;
1713	Receives rebuke from Norway, and in fine
1714	Makes vow before his uncle never more
1715	To give the assay of arms against your majesty.
1716	Whereon old Norway, overcome with joy,
1717	Gives him three thousand crowns in annual fee,
1718	And his commission to employ those soldiers,
1719	So levied as before, against the Polack:
1720	With an entreaty, herein further shown,
1721	
1722	[Giving a paper]
1723	
1724	That it might please you to give quiet pass
1725	Through your dominions for this enterprise,
1726	On such regards of safety and allowance
1727	As therein are set down.
1728	
1729	KING CLAUDIUS	It likes us well;
1730	And at our more consider'd time well read,
1731	Answer, and think upon this business.
1732	Meantime we thank you for your well-took labour:
1733	Go to your rest; at night we'll feast together:
1734	Most welcome home!
1735	
1736	[Exeunt VOLTIMAND and CORNELIUS]
1737	
1738	LORD POLONIUS	                  This business is well ended.
1739	My liege, and madam, to expostulate
1740	What majesty should be, what duty is,
1741	Why day is day, night night, and time is time,
1742	Were nothing but to waste night, day and time.
1743	Therefore, since brevity is the soul of wit,
1744	And tediousness the limbs and outward flourishes,
1745	I will be brief: your noble son is mad:
1746	Mad call I it; for, to define true madness,
1747	What is't but to be nothing else but mad?
1748	But let that go.
1749	
1750	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  More matter, with less art.
1751	
1752	LORD POLONIUS	Madam, I swear I use no art at all.
1753	That he is mad, 'tis true: 'tis true 'tis pity;
1754	And pity 'tis 'tis true: a foolish figure;
1755	But farewell it, for I will use no art.
1756	Mad let us grant him, then: and now remains
1757	That we find out the cause of this effect,
1758	Or rather say, the cause of this defect,
1759	For this effect defective comes by cause:
1760	Thus it remains, and the remainder thus. Perpend.
1761	I have a daughter--have while she is mine--
1762	Who, in her duty and obedience, mark,
1763	Hath given me this: now gather, and surmise.
1764	
1765	[Reads]
1766	
1767	'To the celestial and my soul's idol, the most
1768	beautified Ophelia,'--
1769	That's an ill phrase, a vile phrase; 'beautified' is
1770	a vile phrase: but you shall hear. Thus:
1771	
1772	[Reads]
1773	
1774	'In her excellent white bosom, these, &c.'
1775	
1776	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Came this from Hamlet to her?
1777	
1778	LORD POLONIUS	Good madam, stay awhile; I will be faithful.
1779	
1780	[Reads]
1781	
1782	'Doubt thou the stars are fire;
1783	Doubt that the sun doth move;
1784	Doubt truth to be a liar;
1785	But never doubt I love.
1786	'O dear Ophelia, I am ill at these numbers;
1787	I have not art to reckon my groans: but that
1788	I love thee best, O most best, believe it. Adieu.
1789	'Thine evermore most dear lady, whilst
1790	this machine is to him, HAMLET.'
1791	This, in obedience, hath my daughter shown me,
1792	And more above, hath his solicitings,
1793	As they fell out by time, by means and place,
1794	All given to mine ear.
1795	
1796	KING CLAUDIUS	But how hath she
1797	Received his love?
1798	
1799	LORD POLONIUS	                  What do you think of me?
1800	
1801	KING CLAUDIUS	As of a man faithful and honourable.
1802	
1803	LORD POLONIUS	I would fain prove so. But what might you think,
1804	When I had seen this hot love on the wing--
1805	As I perceived it, I must tell you that,
1806	Before my daughter told me--what might you,
1807	Or my dear majesty your queen here, think,
1808	If I had play'd the desk or table-book,
1809	Or given my heart a winking, mute and dumb,
1810	Or look'd upon this love with idle sight;
1811	What might you think? No, I went round to work,
1812	And my young mistress thus I did bespeak:
1813	'Lord Hamlet is a prince, out of thy star;
1814	This must not be:' and then I precepts gave her,
1815	That she should lock herself from his resort,
1816	Admit no messengers, receive no tokens.
1817	Which done, she took the fruits of my advice;
1818	And he, repulsed--a short tale to make--
1819	Fell into a sadness, then into a fast,
1820	Thence to a watch, thence into a weakness,
1821	Thence to a lightness, and, by this declension,
1822	Into the madness wherein now he raves,
1823	And all we mourn for.
1824	
1825	KING CLAUDIUS	Do you think 'tis this?
1826	
1827	QUEEN GERTRUDE	It may be, very likely.
1828	
1829	LORD POLONIUS	Hath there been such a time--I'd fain know that--
1830	That I have positively said 'Tis so,'
1831	When it proved otherwise?
1832	
1833	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I know.
1834	
1835	LORD POLONIUS	[Pointing to his head and shoulder]
1836	
1837	Take this from this, if this be otherwise:
1838	If circumstances lead me, I will find
1839	Where truth is hid, though it were hid indeed
1840	Within the centre.
1841	
1842	KING CLAUDIUS	                  How may we try it further?
1843	
1844	LORD POLONIUS	You know, sometimes he walks four hours together
1845	Here in the lobby.
1846	
1847	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  So he does indeed.
1848	
1849	LORD POLONIUS	At such a time I'll loose my daughter to him:
1850	Be you and I behind an arras then;
1851	Mark the encounter: if he love her not
1852	And be not from his reason fall'n thereon,
1853	Let me be no assistant for a state,
1854	But keep a farm and carters.
1855	
1856	KING CLAUDIUS	We will try it.
1857	
1858	QUEEN GERTRUDE	But, look, where sadly the poor wretch comes reading.
1859	
1860	LORD POLONIUS	Away, I do beseech you, both away:
1861	I'll board him presently.
1862	
1863	[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, and
1864	Attendants]
1865	
1866	[Enter HAMLET, reading]
1867	
1868	O, give me leave:
1869	How does my good Lord Hamlet?
1870	
1871	HAMLET	Well, God-a-mercy.
1872	
1873	LORD POLONIUS	Do you know me, my lord?
1874	
1875	HAMLET	Excellent well; you are a fishmonger.
1876	
1877	LORD POLONIUS	Not I, my lord.
1878	
1879	HAMLET	Then I would you were so honest a man.
1880	
1881	LORD POLONIUS	Honest, my lord!
1882	
1883	HAMLET	Ay, sir; to be honest, as this world goes, is to be
1884	one man picked out of ten thousand.
1885	
1886	LORD POLONIUS	That's very true, my lord.
1887	
1888	HAMLET	For if the sun breed maggots in a dead dog, being a
1889	god kissing carrion,--Have you a daughter?
1890	
1891	LORD POLONIUS	I have, my lord.
1892	
1893	HAMLET	Let her not walk i' the sun: conception is a
1894	blessing: but not as your daughter may conceive.
1895	Friend, look to 't.
1896	
1897	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  How say you by that? Still harping on my
1898	daughter: yet he knew me not at first; he said I
1899	was a fishmonger: he is far gone, far gone: and
1900	truly in my youth I suffered much extremity for
1901	love; very near this. I'll speak to him again.
1902	What do you read, my lord?
1903	
1904	HAMLET	Words, words, words.
1905	
1906	LORD POLONIUS	What is the matter, my lord?
1907	
1908	HAMLET	Between who?
1909	
1910	LORD POLONIUS	I mean, the matter that you read, my lord.
1911	
1912	HAMLET	Slanders, sir: for the satirical rogue says here
1913	that old men have grey beards, that their faces are
1914	wrinkled, their eyes purging thick amber and
1915	plum-tree gum and that they have a plentiful lack of
1916	wit, together with most weak hams: all which, sir,
1917	though I most powerfully and potently believe, yet
1918	I hold it not honesty to have it thus set down, for
1919	yourself, sir, should be old as I am, if like a crab
1920	you could go backward.
1921	
1922	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Though this be madness, yet there is method
1923	in 't. Will you walk out of the air, my lord?
1924	
1925	HAMLET	Into my grave.
1926	
1927	LORD POLONIUS	Indeed, that is out o' the air.
1928	
1929	[Aside]
1930	
1931	How pregnant sometimes his replies are! a happiness
1932	that often madness hits on, which reason and sanity
1933	could not so prosperously be delivered of. I will
1934	leave him, and suddenly contrive the means of
1935	meeting between him and my daughter.--My honourable
1936	lord, I will most humbly take my leave of you.
1937	
1938	HAMLET	You cannot, sir, take from me any thing that I will
1939	more willingly part withal: except my life, except
1940	my life, except my life.
1941	
1942	LORD POLONIUS	Fare you well, my lord.
1943	
1944	HAMLET	These tedious old fools!
1945	
1946	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
1947	
1948	LORD POLONIUS	You go to seek the Lord Hamlet; there he is.
1949	
1950	ROSENCRANTZ	[To POLONIUS]  God save you, sir!
1951	
1952	[Exit POLONIUS]
1953	
1954	GUILDENSTERN	My honoured lord!
1955	
1956	ROSENCRANTZ	My most dear lord!
1957	
1958	HAMLET	My excellent good friends! How dost thou,
1959	Guildenstern? Ah, Rosencrantz! Good lads, how do ye both?
1960	
1961	ROSENCRANTZ	As the indifferent children of the earth.
1962	
1963	GUILDENSTERN	Happy, in that we are not over-happy;
1964	On fortune's cap we are not the very button.
1965	
1966	HAMLET	Nor the soles of her shoe?
1967	
1968	ROSENCRANTZ	Neither, my lord.
1969	
1970	HAMLET	Then you live about her waist, or in the middle of
1971	her favours?
1972	
1973	GUILDENSTERN	'Faith, her privates we.
1974	
1975	HAMLET	In the secret parts of fortune? O, most true; she
1976	is a strumpet. What's the news?
1977	
1978	ROSENCRANTZ	None, my lord, but that the world's grown honest.
1979	
1980	HAMLET	Then is doomsday near: but your news is not true.
1981	Let me question more in particular: what have you,
1982	my good friends, deserved at the hands of fortune,
1983	that she sends you to prison hither?
1984	
1985	GUILDENSTERN	Prison, my lord!
1986	
1987	HAMLET	Denmark's a prison.
1988	
1989	ROSENCRANTZ	Then is the world one.
1990	
1991	HAMLET	A goodly one; in which there are many confines,
1992	wards and dungeons, Denmark being one o' the worst.
1993	
1994	ROSENCRANTZ	We think not so, my lord.
1995	
1996	HAMLET	Why, then, 'tis none to you; for there is nothing
1997	either good or bad, but thinking makes it so: to me
1998	it is a prison.
1999	
2000	ROSENCRANTZ	Why then, your ambition makes it one; 'tis too
2001	narrow for your mind.
2002	
2003	HAMLET	O God, I could be bounded in a nut shell and count
2004	myself a king of infinite space, were it not that I
2005	have bad dreams.
2006	
2007	GUILDENSTERN	Which dreams indeed are ambition, for the very
2008	substance of the ambitious is merely the shadow of a dream.
2009	
2010	HAMLET	A dream itself is but a shadow.
2011	
2012	ROSENCRANTZ	Truly, and I hold ambition of so airy and light a
2013	quality that it is but a shadow's shadow.
2014	
2015	HAMLET	Then are our beggars bodies, and our monarchs and
2016	outstretched heroes the beggars' shadows. Shall we
2017	to the court? for, by my fay, I cannot reason.
2018	
2019	
2020	ROSENCRANTZ	|
2021	| We'll wait upon you.
2022	GUILDENSTERN	|
2023	
2024	
2025	HAMLET	No such matter: I will not sort you with the rest
2026	of my servants, for, to speak to you like an honest
2027	man, I am most dreadfully attended. But, in the
2028	beaten way of friendship, what make you at Elsinore?
2029	
2030	ROSENCRANTZ	To visit you, my lord; no other occasion.
2031	
2032	HAMLET	Beggar that I am, I am even poor in thanks; but I
2033	thank you: and sure, dear friends, my thanks are
2034	too dear a halfpenny. Were you not sent for? Is it
2035	your own inclining? Is it a free visitation? Come,
2036	deal justly with me: come, come; nay, speak.
2037	
2038	GUILDENSTERN	What should we say, my lord?
2039	
2040	HAMLET	Why, any thing, but to the purpose. You were sent
2041	for; and there is a kind of confession in your looks
2042	which your modesties have not craft enough to colour:
2043	I know the good king and queen have sent for you.
2044	
2045	ROSENCRANTZ	To what end, my lord?
2046	
2047	HAMLET	That you must teach me. But let me conjure you, by
2048	the rights of our fellowship, by the consonancy of
2049	our youth, by the obligation of our ever-preserved
2050	love, and by what more dear a better proposer could
2051	charge you withal, be even and direct with me,
2052	whether you were sent for, or no?
2053	
2054	ROSENCRANTZ	[Aside to GUILDENSTERN]  What say you?
2055	
2056	HAMLET	[Aside]  Nay, then, I have an eye of you.--If you
2057	love me, hold not off.
2058	
2059	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, we were sent for.
2060	
2061	HAMLET	I will tell you why; so shall my anticipation
2062	prevent your discovery, and your secrecy to the king
2063	and queen moult no feather. I have of late--but
2064	wherefore I know not--lost all my mirth, forgone all
2065	custom of exercises; and indeed it goes so heavily
2066	with my disposition that this goodly frame, the
2067	earth, seems to me a sterile promontory, this most
2068	excellent canopy, the air, look you, this brave
2069	o'erhanging firmament, this majestical roof fretted
2070	with golden fire, why, it appears no other thing to
2071	me than a foul and pestilent congregation of vapours.
2072	What a piece of work is a man! how noble in reason!
2073	how infinite in faculty! in form and moving how
2074	express and admirable! in action how like an angel!
2075	in apprehension how like a god! the beauty of the
2076	world! the paragon of animals! And yet, to me,
2077	what is this quintessence of dust? man delights not
2078	me: no, nor woman neither, though by your smiling
2079	you seem to say so.
2080	
2081	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, there was no such stuff in my thoughts.
2082	
2083	HAMLET	Why did you laugh then, when I said 'man delights not me'?
2084	
2085	ROSENCRANTZ	To think, my lord, if you delight not in man, what
2086	lenten entertainment the players shall receive from
2087	you: we coted them on the way; and hither are they
2088	coming, to offer you service.
2089	
2090	HAMLET	He that plays the king shall be welcome; his majesty
2091	shall have tribute of me; the adventurous knight
2092	shall use his foil and target; the lover shall not
2093	sigh gratis; the humourous man shall end his part
2094	in peace; the clown shall make those laugh whose
2095	lungs are tickled o' the sere; and the lady shall
2096	say her mind freely, or the blank verse shall halt
2097	for't. What players are they?
2098	
2099	ROSENCRANTZ	Even those you were wont to take delight in, the
2100	tragedians of the city.
2101	
2102	HAMLET	How chances it they travel? their residence, both
2103	in reputation and profit, was better both ways.
2104	
2105	ROSENCRANTZ	I think their inhibition comes by the means of the
2106	late innovation.
2107	
2108	HAMLET	Do they hold the same estimation they did when I was
2109	in the city? are they so followed?
2110	
2111	ROSENCRANTZ	No, indeed, are they not.
2112	
2113	HAMLET	How comes it? do they grow rusty?
2114	
2115	ROSENCRANTZ	Nay, their endeavour keeps in the wonted pace: but
2116	there is, sir, an aery of children, little eyases,
2117	that cry out on the top of question, and are most
2118	tyrannically clapped for't: these are now the
2119	fashion, and so berattle the common stages--so they
2120	call them--that many wearing rapiers are afraid of
2121	goose-quills and dare scarce come thither.
2122	
2123	HAMLET	What, are they children? who maintains 'em? how are
2124	they escoted? Will they pursue the quality no
2125	longer than they can sing? will they not say
2126	afterwards, if they should grow themselves to common
2127	players--as it is most like, if their means are no
2128	better--their writers do them wrong, to make them
2129	exclaim against their own succession?
2130	
2131	ROSENCRANTZ	'Faith, there has been much to do on both sides; and
2132	the nation holds it no sin to tarre them to
2133	controversy: there was, for a while, no money bid
2134	for argument, unless the poet and the player went to
2135	cuffs in the question.
2136	
2137	HAMLET	Is't possible?
2138	
2139	GUILDENSTERN	O, there has been much throwing about of brains.
2140	
2141	HAMLET	Do the boys carry it away?
2142	
2143	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, that they do, my lord; Hercules and his load too.
2144	
2145	HAMLET	It is not very strange; for mine uncle is king of
2146	Denmark, and those that would make mows at him while
2147	my father lived, give twenty, forty, fifty, an
2148	hundred ducats a-piece for his picture in little.
2149	'Sblood, there is something in this more than
2150	natural, if philosophy could find it out.
2151	
2152	[Flourish of trumpets within]
2153	
2154	GUILDENSTERN	There are the players.
2155	
2156	HAMLET	Gentlemen, you are welcome to Elsinore. Your hands,
2157	come then: the appurtenance of welcome is fashion
2158	and ceremony: let me comply with you in this garb,
2159	lest my extent to the players, which, I tell you,
2160	must show fairly outward, should more appear like
2161	entertainment than yours. You are welcome: but my
2162	uncle-father and aunt-mother are deceived.
2163	
2164	GUILDENSTERN	In what, my dear lord?
2165	
2166	HAMLET	I am but mad north-north-west: when the wind is
2167	southerly I know a hawk from a handsaw.
2168	
2169	[Enter POLONIUS]
2170	
2171	LORD POLONIUS	Well be with you, gentlemen!
2172	
2173	HAMLET	Hark you, Guildenstern; and you too: at each ear a
2174	hearer: that great baby you see there is not yet
2175	out of his swaddling-clouts.
2176	
2177	ROSENCRANTZ	Happily he's the second time come to them; for they
2178	say an old man is twice a child.
2179	
2180	HAMLET	I will prophesy he comes to tell me of the players;
2181	mark it. You say right, sir: o' Monday morning;
2182	'twas so indeed.
2183	
2184	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I have news to tell you.
2185	
2186	HAMLET	My lord, I have news to tell you.
2187	When Roscius was an actor in Rome,--
2188	
2189	LORD POLONIUS	The actors are come hither, my lord.
2190	
2191	HAMLET	Buz, buz!
2192	
2193	LORD POLONIUS	Upon mine honour,--
2194	
2195	HAMLET	Then came each actor on his ass,--
2196	
2197	LORD POLONIUS	The best actors in the world, either for tragedy,
2198	comedy, history, pastoral, pastoral-comical,
2199	historical-pastoral, tragical-historical, tragical-
2200	comical-historical-pastoral, scene individable, or
2201	poem unlimited: Seneca cannot be too heavy, nor
2202	Plautus too light. For the law of writ and the
2203	liberty, these are the only men.
2204	
2205	HAMLET	O Jephthah, judge of Israel, what a treasure hadst thou!
2206	
2207	LORD POLONIUS	What a treasure had he, my lord?
2208	
2209	HAMLET	Why,
2210	'One fair daughter and no more,
2211	The which he loved passing well.'
2212	
2213	LORD POLONIUS	[Aside]  Still on my daughter.
2214	
2215	HAMLET	Am I not i' the right, old Jephthah?
2216	
2217	LORD POLONIUS	If you call me Jephthah, my lord, I have a daughter
2218	that I love passing well.
2219	
2220	HAMLET	Nay, that follows not.
2221	
2222	LORD POLONIUS	What follows, then, my lord?
2223	
2224	HAMLET	Why,
2225	'As by lot, God wot,'
2226	and then, you know,
2227	'It came to pass, as most like it was,'--
2228	the first row of the pious chanson will show you
2229	more; for look, where my abridgement comes.
2230	
2231	[Enter four or five Players]
2232	
2233	You are welcome, masters; welcome, all. I am glad
2234	to see thee well. Welcome, good friends. O, my old
2235	friend! thy face is valenced since I saw thee last:
2236	comest thou to beard me in Denmark? What, my young
2237	lady and mistress! By'r lady, your ladyship is
2238	nearer to heaven than when I saw you last, by the
2239	altitude of a chopine. Pray God, your voice, like
2240	apiece of uncurrent gold, be not cracked within the
2241	ring. Masters, you are all welcome. We'll e'en
2242	to't like French falconers, fly at any thing we see:
2243	we'll have a speech straight: come, give us a taste
2244	of your quality; come, a passionate speech.
2245	
2246	First Player	What speech, my lord?
2247	
2248	HAMLET	I heard thee speak me a speech once, but it was
2249	never acted; or, if it was, not above once; for the
2250	play, I remember, pleased not the million; 'twas
2251	caviare to the general: but it was--as I received
2252	it, and others, whose judgments in such matters
2253	cried in the top of mine--an excellent play, well
2254	digested in the scenes, set down with as much
2255	modesty as cunning. I remember, one said there
2256	were no sallets in the lines to make the matter
2257	savoury, nor no matter in the phrase that might
2258	indict the author of affectation; but called it an
2259	honest method, as wholesome as sweet, and by very
2260	much more handsome than fine. One speech in it I
2261	chiefly loved: 'twas Aeneas' tale to Dido; and
2262	thereabout of it especially, where he speaks of
2263	Priam's slaughter: if it live in your memory, begin
2264	at this line: let me see, let me see--
2265	'The rugged Pyrrhus, like the Hyrcanian beast,'--
2266	it is not so:--it begins with Pyrrhus:--
2267	'The rugged Pyrrhus, he whose sable arms,
2268	Black as his purpose, did the night resemble
2269	When he lay couched in the ominous horse,
2270	Hath now this dread and black complexion smear'd
2271	With heraldry more dismal; head to foot
2272	Now is he total gules; horridly trick'd
2273	With blood of fathers, mothers, daughters, sons,
2274	Baked and impasted with the parching streets,
2275	That lend a tyrannous and damned light
2276	To their lord's murder: roasted in wrath and fire,
2277	And thus o'er-sized with coagulate gore,
2278	With eyes like carbuncles, the hellish Pyrrhus
2279	Old grandsire Priam seeks.'
2280	So, proceed you.
2281	
2282	LORD POLONIUS	'Fore God, my lord, well spoken, with good accent and
2283	good discretion.
2284	
2285	First Player	'Anon he finds him
2286	Striking too short at Greeks; his antique sword,
2287	Rebellious to his arm, lies where it falls,
2288	Repugnant to command: unequal match'd,
2289	Pyrrhus at Priam drives; in rage strikes wide;
2290	But with the whiff and wind of his fell sword
2291	The unnerved father falls. Then senseless Ilium,
2292	Seeming to feel this blow, with flaming top
2293	Stoops to his base, and with a hideous crash
2294	Takes prisoner Pyrrhus' ear: for, lo! his sword,
2295	Which was declining on the milky head
2296	Of reverend Priam, seem'd i' the air to stick:
2297	So, as a painted tyrant, Pyrrhus stood,
2298	And like a neutral to his will and matter,
2299	Did nothing.
2300	But, as we often see, against some storm,
2301	A silence in the heavens, the rack stand still,
2302	The bold winds speechless and the orb below
2303	As hush as death, anon the dreadful thunder
2304	Doth rend the region, so, after Pyrrhus' pause,
2305	Aroused vengeance sets him new a-work;
2306	And never did the Cyclops' hammers fall
2307	On Mars's armour forged for proof eterne
2308	With less remorse than Pyrrhus' bleeding sword
2309	Now falls on Priam.
2310	Out, out, thou strumpet, Fortune! All you gods,
2311	In general synod 'take away her power;
2312	Break all the spokes and fellies from her wheel,
2313	And bowl the round nave down the hill of heaven,
2314	As low as to the fiends!'
2315	
2316	LORD POLONIUS	This is too long.
2317	
2318	HAMLET	It shall to the barber's, with your beard. Prithee,
2319	say on: he's for a jig or a tale of bawdry, or he
2320	sleeps: say on: come to Hecuba.
2321	
2322	First Player	'But who, O, who had seen the mobled queen--'
2323	
2324	HAMLET	'The mobled queen?'
2325	
2326	LORD POLONIUS	That's good; 'mobled queen' is good.
2327	
2328	First Player	'Run barefoot up and down, threatening the flames
2329	With bisson rheum; a clout upon that head
2330	Where late the diadem stood, and for a robe,
2331	About her lank and all o'er-teemed loins,
2332	A blanket, in the alarm of fear caught up;
2333	Who this had seen, with tongue in venom steep'd,
2334	'Gainst Fortune's state would treason have
2335	pronounced:
2336	But if the gods themselves did see her then
2337	When she saw Pyrrhus make malicious sport
2338	In mincing with his sword her husband's limbs,
2339	The instant burst of clamour that she made,
2340	Unless things mortal move them not at all,
2341	Would have made milch the burning eyes of heaven,
2342	And passion in the gods.'
2343	
2344	LORD POLONIUS	Look, whether he has not turned his colour and has
2345	tears in's eyes. Pray you, no more.
2346	
2347	HAMLET	'Tis well: I'll have thee speak out the rest soon.
2348	Good my lord, will you see the players well
2349	bestowed? Do you hear, let them be well used; for
2350	they are the abstract and brief chronicles of the
2351	time: after your death you were better have a bad
2352	epitaph than their ill report while you live.
2353	
2354	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, I will use them according to their desert.
2355	
2356	HAMLET	God's bodykins, man, much better: use every man
2357	after his desert, and who should 'scape whipping?
2358	Use them after your own honour and dignity: the less
2359	they deserve, the more merit is in your bounty.
2360	Take them in.
2361	
2362	LORD POLONIUS	Come, sirs.
2363	
2364	HAMLET	Follow him, friends: we'll hear a play to-morrow.
2365	
2366	[Exit POLONIUS with all the Players but the First]
2367	
2368	Dost thou hear me, old friend; can you play the
2369	Murder of Gonzago?
2370	
2371	First Player	Ay, my lord.
2372	
2373	HAMLET	We'll ha't to-morrow night. You could, for a need,
2374	study a speech of some dozen or sixteen lines, which
2375	I would set down and insert in't, could you not?
2376	
2377	First Player	Ay, my lord.
2378	
2379	HAMLET	Very well. Follow that lord; and look you mock him
2380	not.
2381	
2382	[Exit First Player]
2383	
2384	My good friends, I'll leave you till night: you are
2385	welcome to Elsinore.
2386	
2387	ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord!
2388	
2389	HAMLET	Ay, so, God be wi' ye;
2390	
2391	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
2392	
2393	Now I am alone.
2394	O, what a rogue and peasant slave am I!
2395	Is it not monstrous that this player here,
2396	But in a fiction, in a dream of passion,
2397	Could force his soul so to his own conceit
2398	That from her working all his visage wann'd,
2399	Tears in his eyes, distraction in's aspect,
2400	A broken voice, and his whole function suiting
2401	With forms to his conceit? and all for nothing!
2402	For Hecuba!
2403	What's Hecuba to him, or he to Hecuba,
2404	That he should weep for her? What would he do,
2405	Had he the motive and the cue for passion
2406	That I have? He would drown the stage with tears
2407	And cleave the general ear with horrid speech,
2408	Make mad the guilty and appal the free,
2409	Confound the ignorant, and amaze indeed
2410	The very faculties of eyes and ears. Yet I,
2411	A dull and muddy-mettled rascal, peak,
2412	Like John-a-dreams, unpregnant of my cause,
2413	And can say nothing; no, not for a king,
2414	Upon whose property and most dear life
2415	A damn'd defeat was made. Am I a coward?
2416	Who calls me villain? breaks my pate across?
2417	Plucks off my beard, and blows it in my face?
2418	Tweaks me by the nose? gives me the lie i' the throat,
2419	As deep as to the lungs? who does me this?
2420	Ha!
2421	'Swounds, I should take it: for it cannot be
2422	But I am pigeon-liver'd and lack gall
2423	To make oppression bitter, or ere this
2424	I should have fatted all the region kites
2425	With this slave's offal: bloody, bawdy villain!
2426	Remorseless, treacherous, lecherous, kindless villain!
2427	O, vengeance!
2428	Why, what an ass am I! This is most brave,
2429	That I, the son of a dear father murder'd,
2430	Prompted to my revenge by heaven and hell,
2431	Must, like a whore, unpack my heart with words,
2432	And fall a-cursing, like a very drab,
2433	A scullion!
2434	Fie upon't! foh! About, my brain! I have heard
2435	That guilty creatures sitting at a play
2436	Have by the very cunning of the scene
2437	Been struck so to the soul that presently
2438	They have proclaim'd their malefactions;
2439	For murder, though it have no tongue, will speak
2440	With most miraculous organ. I'll have these players
2441	Play something like the murder of my father
2442	Before mine uncle: I'll observe his looks;
2443	I'll tent him to the quick: if he but blench,
2444	I know my course. The spirit that I have seen
2445	May be the devil: and the devil hath power
2446	To assume a pleasing shape; yea, and perhaps
2447	Out of my weakness and my melancholy,
2448	As he is very potent with such spirits,
2449	Abuses me to damn me: I'll have grounds
2450	More relative than this: the play 's the thing
2451	Wherein I'll catch the conscience of the king.
2452

2461	ACT III
2462	
2463	
2464	
2465	SCENE I	A room in the castle.
2466	
2467	
2468	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS,
2469	OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
2470	
2471	KING CLAUDIUS	And can you, by no drift of circumstance,
2472	Get from him why he puts on this confusion,
2473	Grating so harshly all his days of quiet
2474	With turbulent and dangerous lunacy?
2475	
2476	ROSENCRANTZ	He does confess he feels himself distracted;
2477	But from what cause he will by no means speak.
2478	
2479	GUILDENSTERN	Nor do we find him forward to be sounded,
2480	But, with a crafty madness, keeps aloof,
2481	When we would bring him on to some confession
2482	Of his true state.
2483	
2484	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Did he receive you well?
2485	
2486	ROSENCRANTZ	Most like a gentleman.
2487	
2488	GUILDENSTERN	But with much forcing of his disposition.
2489	
2490	ROSENCRANTZ	Niggard of question; but, of our demands,
2491	Most free in his reply.
2492	
2493	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Did you assay him?
2494	To any pastime?
2495	
2496	ROSENCRANTZ	Madam, it so fell out, that certain players
2497	We o'er-raught on the way: of these we told him;
2498	And there did seem in him a kind of joy
2499	To hear of it: they are about the court,
2500	And, as I think, they have already order
2501	This night to play before him.
2502	
2503	LORD POLONIUS	'Tis most true:
2504	And he beseech'd me to entreat your majesties
2505	To hear and see the matter.
2506	
2507	KING CLAUDIUS	With all my heart; and it doth much content me
2508	To hear him so inclined.
2509	Good gentlemen, give him a further edge,
2510	And drive his purpose on to these delights.
2511	
2512	ROSENCRANTZ	We shall, my lord.
2513	
2514	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
2515	
2516	KING CLAUDIUS	                  Sweet Gertrude, leave us too;
2517	For we have closely sent for Hamlet hither,
2518	That he, as 'twere by accident, may here
2519	Affront Ophelia:
2520	Her father and myself, lawful espials,
2521	Will so bestow ourselves that, seeing, unseen,
2522	We may of their encounter frankly judge,
2523	And gather by him, as he is behaved,
2524	If 't be the affliction of his love or no
2525	That thus he suffers for.
2526	
2527	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I shall obey you.
2528	And for your part, Ophelia, I do wish
2529	That your good beauties be the happy cause
2530	Of Hamlet's wildness: so shall I hope your virtues
2531	Will bring him to his wonted way again,
2532	To both your honours.
2533	
2534	OPHELIA	Madam, I wish it may.
2535	
2536	[Exit QUEEN GERTRUDE]
2537	
2538	LORD POLONIUS	Ophelia, walk you here. Gracious, so please you,
2539	We will bestow ourselves.
2540	
2541	[To OPHELIA]
2542	
2543	Read on this book;
2544	That show of such an exercise may colour
2545	Your loneliness. We are oft to blame in this,--
2546	'Tis too much proved--that with devotion's visage
2547	And pious action we do sugar o'er
2548	The devil himself.
2549	
2550	KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]          O, 'tis too true!
2551	How smart a lash that speech doth give my conscience!
2552	The harlot's cheek, beautied with plastering art,
2553	Is not more ugly to the thing that helps it
2554	Than is my deed to my most painted word:
2555	O heavy burthen!
2556	
2557	LORD POLONIUS	I hear him coming: let's withdraw, my lord.
2558	
2559	[Exeunt KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]
2560	
2561	[Enter HAMLET]
2562	
2563	HAMLET	To be, or not to be: that is the question:
2564	Whether 'tis nobler in the mind to suffer
2565	The slings and arrows of outrageous fortune,
2566	Or to take arms against a sea of troubles,
2567	And by opposing end them? To die: to sleep;
2568	No more; and by a sleep to say we end
2569	The heart-ache and the thousand natural shocks
2570	That flesh is heir to, 'tis a consummation
2571	Devoutly to be wish'd. To die, to sleep;
2572	To sleep: perchance to dream: ay, there's the rub;
2573	For in that sleep of death what dreams may come
2574	When we have shuffled off this mortal coil,
2575	Must give us pause: there's the respect
2576	That makes calamity of so long life;
2577	For who would bear the whips and scorns of time,
2578	The oppressor's wrong, the proud man's contumely,
2579	The pangs of despised love, the law's delay,
2580	The insolence of office and the spurns
2581	That patient merit of the unworthy takes,
2582	When he himself might his quietus make
2583	With a bare bodkin? who would fardels bear,
2584	To grunt and sweat under a weary life,
2585	But that the dread of something after death,
2586	The undiscover'd country from whose bourn
2587	No traveller returns, puzzles the will
2588	And makes us rather bear those ills we have
2589	Than fly to others that we know not of?
2590	Thus conscience does make cowards of us all;
2591	And thus the native hue of resolution
2592	Is sicklied o'er with the pale cast of thought,
2593	And enterprises of great pith and moment
2594	With this regard their currents turn awry,
2595	And lose the name of action.--Soft you now!
2596	The fair Ophelia! Nymph, in thy orisons
2597	Be all my sins remember'd.
2598	
2599	OPHELIA	Good my lord,
2600	How does your honour for this many a day?
2601	
2602	HAMLET	I humbly thank you; well, well, well.
2603	
2604	OPHELIA	My lord, I have remembrances of yours,
2605	That I have longed long to re-deliver;
2606	I pray you, now receive them.
2607	
2608	HAMLET	No, not I;
2609	I never gave you aught.
2610	
2611	OPHELIA	My honour'd lord, you know right well you did;
2612	And, with them, words of so sweet breath composed
2613	As made the things more rich: their perfume lost,
2614	Take these again; for to the noble mind
2615	Rich gifts wax poor when givers prove unkind.
2616	There, my lord.
2617	
2618	HAMLET	Ha, ha! are you honest?
2619	
2620	OPHELIA	My lord?
2621	
2622	HAMLET	Are you fair?
2623	
2624	OPHELIA	What means your lordship?
2625	
2626	HAMLET	That if you be honest and fair, your honesty should
2627	admit no discourse to your beauty.
2628	
2629	OPHELIA	Could beauty, my lord, have better commerce than
2630	with honesty?
2631	
2632	HAMLET	Ay, truly; for the power of beauty will sooner
2633	transform honesty from what it is to a bawd than the
2634	force of honesty can translate beauty into his
2635	likeness: this was sometime a paradox, but now the
2636	time gives it proof. I did love you once.
2637	
2638	OPHELIA	Indeed, my lord, you made me believe so.
2639	
2640	HAMLET	You should not have believed me; for virtue cannot
2641	so inoculate our old stock but we shall relish of
2642	it: I loved you not.
2643	
2644	OPHELIA	I was the more deceived.
2645	
2646	HAMLET	Get thee to a nunnery: why wouldst thou be a
2647	breeder of sinners? I am myself indifferent honest;
2648	but yet I could accuse me of such things that it
2649	were better my mother had not borne me: I am very
2650	proud, revengeful, ambitious, with more offences at
2651	my beck than I have thoughts to put them in,
2652	imagination to give them shape, or time to act them
2653	in. What should such fellows as I do crawling
2654	between earth and heaven? We are arrant knaves,
2655	all; believe none of us. Go thy ways to a nunnery.
2656	Where's your father?
2657	
2658	OPHELIA	At home, my lord.
2659	
2660	HAMLET	Let the doors be shut upon him, that he may play the
2661	fool no where but in's own house. Farewell.
2662	
2663	OPHELIA	O, help him, you sweet heavens!
2664	
2665	HAMLET	If thou dost marry, I'll give thee this plague for
2666	thy dowry: be thou as chaste as ice, as pure as
2667	snow, thou shalt not escape calumny. Get thee to a
2668	nunnery, go: farewell. Or, if thou wilt needs
2669	marry, marry a fool; for wise men know well enough
2670	what monsters you make of them. To a nunnery, go,
2671	and quickly too. Farewell.
2672	
2673	OPHELIA	O heavenly powers, restore him!
2674	
2675	HAMLET	I have heard of your paintings too, well enough; God
2676	has given you one face, and you make yourselves
2677	another: you jig, you amble, and you lisp, and
2678	nick-name God's creatures, and make your wantonness
2679	your ignorance. Go to, I'll no more on't; it hath
2680	made me mad. I say, we will have no more marriages:
2681	those that are married already, all but one, shall
2682	live; the rest shall keep as they are. To a
2683	nunnery, go.
2684	
2685	[Exit]
2686	
2687	OPHELIA	O, what a noble mind is here o'erthrown!
2688	The courtier's, soldier's, scholar's, eye, tongue, sword;
2689	The expectancy and rose of the fair state,
2690	The glass of fashion and the mould of form,
2691	The observed of all observers, quite, quite down!
2692	And I, of ladies most deject and wretched,
2693	That suck'd the honey of his music vows,
2694	Now see that noble and most sovereign reason,
2695	Like sweet bells jangled, out of tune and harsh;
2696	That unmatch'd form and feature of blown youth
2697	Blasted with ecstasy: O, woe is me,
2698	To have seen what I have seen, see what I see!
2699	
2700	[Re-enter KING CLAUDIUS and POLONIUS]
2701	
2702	KING CLAUDIUS	Love! his affections do not that way tend;
2703	Nor what he spake, though it lack'd form a little,
2704	Was not like madness. There's something in his soul,
2705	O'er which his melancholy sits on brood;
2706	And I do doubt the hatch and the disclose
2707	Will be some danger: which for to prevent,
2708	I have in quick determination
2709	Thus set it down: he shall with speed to England,
2710	For the demand of our neglected tribute
2711	Haply the seas and countries different
2712	With variable objects shall expel
2713	This something-settled matter in his heart,
2714	Whereon his brains still beating puts him thus
2715	From fashion of himself. What think you on't?
2716	
2717	LORD POLONIUS	It shall do well: but yet do I believe
2718	The origin and commencement of his grief
2719	Sprung from neglected love. How now, Ophelia!
2720	You need not tell us what Lord Hamlet said;
2721	We heard it all. My lord, do as you please;
2722	But, if you hold it fit, after the play
2723	Let his queen mother all alone entreat him
2724	To show his grief: let her be round with him;
2725	And I'll be placed, so please you, in the ear
2726	Of all their conference. If she find him not,
2727	To England send him, or confine him where
2728	Your wisdom best shall think.
2729	
2730	KING CLAUDIUS	It shall be so:
2731	Madness in great ones must not unwatch'd go.
2732

2740	
2741	ACT III
2742	
2743	
2744	
2745	SCENE II	A hall in the castle.
2746	
2747	
2748	[Enter HAMLET and Players]
2749	
2750	HAMLET	Speak the speech, I pray you, as I pronounced it to
2751	you, trippingly on the tongue: but if you mouth it,
2752	as many of your players do, I had as lief the
2753	town-crier spoke my lines. Nor do not saw the air
2754	too much with your hand, thus, but use all gently;
2755	for in the very torrent, tempest, and, as I may say,
2756	the whirlwind of passion, you must acquire and beget
2757	a temperance that may give it smoothness. O, it
2758	offends me to the soul to hear a robustious
2759	periwig-pated fellow tear a passion to tatters, to
2760	very rags, to split the ears of the groundlings, who
2761	for the most part are capable of nothing but
2762	inexplicable dumbshows and noise: I would have such
2763	a fellow whipped for o'erdoing Termagant; it
2764	out-herods Herod: pray you, avoid it.
2765	
2766	First Player	I warrant your honour.
2767	
2768	HAMLET	Be not too tame neither, but let your own discretion
2769	be your tutor: suit the action to the word, the
2770	word to the action; with this special o'erstep not
2771	the modesty of nature: for any thing so overdone is
2772	from the purpose of playing, whose end, both at the
2773	first and now, was and is, to hold, as 'twere, the
2774	mirror up to nature; to show virtue her own feature,
2775	scorn her own image, and the very age and body of
2776	the time his form and pressure. Now this overdone,
2777	or come tardy off, though it make the unskilful
2778	laugh, cannot but make the judicious grieve; the
2779	censure of the which one must in your allowance
2780	o'erweigh a whole theatre of others. O, there be
2781	players that I have seen play, and heard others
2782	praise, and that highly, not to speak it profanely,
2783	that, neither having the accent of Christians nor
2784	the gait of Christian, pagan, nor man, have so
2785	strutted and bellowed that I have thought some of
2786	nature's journeymen had made men and not made them
2787	well, they imitated humanity so abominably.
2788	
2789	First Player	I hope we have reformed that indifferently with us,
2790	sir.
2791	
2792	HAMLET	O, reform it altogether. And let those that play
2793	your clowns speak no more than is set down for them;
2794	for there be of them that will themselves laugh, to
2795	set on some quantity of barren spectators to laugh
2796	too; though, in the mean time, some necessary
2797	question of the play be then to be considered:
2798	that's villanous, and shows a most pitiful ambition
2799	in the fool that uses it. Go, make you ready.
2800	
2801	[Exeunt Players]
2802	
2803	[Enter POLONIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
2804	
2805	How now, my lord! I will the king hear this piece of work?
2806	
2807	LORD POLONIUS	And the queen too, and that presently.
2808	
2809	HAMLET	Bid the players make haste.
2810	
2811	[Exit POLONIUS]
2812	
2813	Will you two help to hasten them?
2814	
2815	
2816	ROSENCRANTZ	|
2817	|  We will, my lord.
2818	GUILDENSTERN	|
2819	
2820	
2821	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
2822	
2823	HAMLET	What ho! Horatio!
2824	
2825	[Enter HORATIO]
2826	
2827	HORATIO	Here, sweet lord, at your service.
2828	
2829	HAMLET	Horatio, thou art e'en as just a man
2830	As e'er my conversation coped withal.
2831	
2832	HORATIO	O, my dear lord,--
2833	
2834	HAMLET	                  Nay, do not think I flatter;
2835	For what advancement may I hope from thee
2836	That no revenue hast but thy good spirits,
2837	To feed and clothe thee? Why should the poor be flatter'd?
2838	No, let the candied tongue lick absurd pomp,
2839	And crook the pregnant hinges of the knee
2840	Where thrift may follow fawning. Dost thou hear?
2841	Since my dear soul was mistress of her choice
2842	And could of men distinguish, her election
2843	Hath seal'd thee for herself; for thou hast been
2844	As one, in suffering all, that suffers nothing,
2845	A man that fortune's buffets and rewards
2846	Hast ta'en with equal thanks: and blest are those
2847	Whose blood and judgment are so well commingled,
2848	That they are not a pipe for fortune's finger
2849	To sound what stop she please. Give me that man
2850	That is not passion's slave, and I will wear him
2851	In my heart's core, ay, in my heart of heart,
2852	As I do thee.--Something too much of this.--
2853	There is a play to-night before the king;
2854	One scene of it comes near the circumstance
2855	Which I have told thee of my father's death:
2856	I prithee, when thou seest that act afoot,
2857	Even with the very comment of thy soul
2858	Observe mine uncle: if his occulted guilt
2859	Do not itself unkennel in one speech,
2860	It is a damned ghost that we have seen,
2861	And my imaginations are as foul
2862	As Vulcan's stithy. Give him heedful note;
2863	For I mine eyes will rivet to his face,
2864	And after we will both our judgments join
2865	In censure of his seeming.
2866	
2867	HORATIO	Well, my lord:
2868	If he steal aught the whilst this play is playing,
2869	And 'scape detecting, I will pay the theft.
2870	
2871	HAMLET	They are coming to the play; I must be idle:
2872	Get you a place.
2873	
2874	[Danish march. A flourish. Enter KING CLAUDIUS,
2875	QUEEN GERTRUDE, POLONIUS, OPHELIA, ROSENCRANTZ,
2876	GUILDENSTERN, and others]
2877	
2878	KING CLAUDIUS	How fares our cousin Hamlet?
2879	
2880	HAMLET	Excellent, i' faith; of the chameleon's dish: I eat
2881	the air, promise-crammed: you cannot feed capons so.
2882	
2883	KING CLAUDIUS	I have nothing with this answer, Hamlet; these words
2884	are not mine.
2885	
2886	HAMLET	No, nor mine now.
2887	
2888	[To POLONIUS]
2889	
2890	My lord, you played once i' the university, you say?
2891	
2892	LORD POLONIUS	That did I, my lord; and was accounted a good actor.
2893	
2894	HAMLET	What did you enact?
2895	
2896	LORD POLONIUS	I did enact Julius Caesar: I was killed i' the
2897	Capitol; Brutus killed me.
2898	
2899	HAMLET	It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf
2900	there. Be the players ready?
2901	
2902	ROSENCRANTZ	Ay, my lord; they stay upon your patience.
2903	
2904	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come hither, my dear Hamlet, sit by me.
2905	
2906	HAMLET	No, good mother, here's metal more attractive.
2907	
2908	LORD POLONIUS	[To KING CLAUDIUS]  O, ho! do you mark that?
2909	
2910	HAMLET	Lady, shall I lie in your lap?
2911	
2912	[Lying down at OPHELIA's feet]
2913	
2914	OPHELIA	No, my lord.
2915	
2916	HAMLET	I mean, my head upon your lap?
2917	
2918	OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
2919	
2920	HAMLET	Do you think I meant country matters?
2921	
2922	OPHELIA	I think nothing, my lord.
2923	
2924	HAMLET	That's a fair thought to lie between maids' legs.
2925	
2926	OPHELIA	What is, my lord?
2927	
2928	HAMLET	Nothing.
2929	
2930	OPHELIA	You are merry, my lord.
2931	
2932	HAMLET	Who, I?
2933	
2934	OPHELIA	Ay, my lord.
2935	
2936	HAMLET	O God, your only jig-maker. What should a man do
2937	but be merry? for, look you, how cheerfully my
2938	mother looks, and my father died within these two hours.
2939	
2940	OPHELIA	Nay, 'tis twice two months, my lord.
2941	
2942	HAMLET	So long? Nay then, let the devil wear black, for
2943	I'll have a suit of sables. O heavens! die two
2944	months ago, and not forgotten yet? Then there's
2945	hope a great man's memory may outlive his life half
2946	a year: but, by'r lady, he must build churches,
2947	then; or else shall he suffer not thinking on, with
2948	the hobby-horse, whose epitaph is 'For, O, for, O,
2949	the hobby-horse is forgot.'
2950	
2951	[Hautboys play. The dumb-show enters]
2952	
2953	[Enter a King and a Queen very lovingly; the Queen
2954	embracing him, and he her. She kneels, and makes
2955	show of protestation unto him. He takes her up,
2956	and declines his head upon her neck: lays him down
2957	upon a bank of flowers: she, seeing him asleep,
2958	leaves him. Anon comes in a fellow, takes off his
2959	crown, kisses it, and pours poison in the King's
2960	ears, and exit. The Queen returns; finds the King
2961	dead, and makes passionate action. The Poisoner,
2962	with some two or three Mutes, comes in again,
2963	seeming to lament with her. The dead body is
2964	carried away. The Poisoner wooes the Queen with
2965	gifts: she seems loath and unwilling awhile, but
2966	in the end accepts his love]
2967	
2968	[Exeunt]
2969	
2970	OPHELIA	What means this, my lord?
2971	
2972	HAMLET	Marry, this is miching mallecho; it means mischief.
2973	
2974	OPHELIA	Belike this show imports the argument of the play.
2975	
2976	[Enter Prologue]
2977	
2978	HAMLET	We shall know by this fellow: the players cannot
2979	keep counsel; they'll tell all.
2980	
2981	OPHELIA	Will he tell us what this show meant?
2982	
2983	HAMLET	Ay, or any show that you'll show him: be not you
2984	ashamed to show, he'll not shame to tell you what it means.
2985	
2986	OPHELIA	You are naught, you are naught: I'll mark the play.
2987	
2988	Prologue	     For us, and for our tragedy,
2989	Here stooping to your clemency,
2990	We beg your hearing patiently.
2991	
2992	[Exit]
2993	
2994	HAMLET	Is this a prologue, or the posy of a ring?
2995	
2996	OPHELIA	'Tis brief, my lord.
2997	
2998	HAMLET	As woman's love.
2999	
3000	[Enter two Players, King and Queen]
3001	
3002	Player King	   Full thirty times hath Phoebus' cart gone round
3003	Neptune's salt wash and Tellus' orbed ground,
3004	And thirty dozen moons with borrow'd sheen
3005	About the world have times twelve thirties been,
3006	Since love our hearts and Hymen did our hands
3007	Unite commutual in most sacred bands.
3008	
3009	Player Queen	   So many journeys may the sun and moon
3010	Make us again count o'er ere love be done!
3011	But, woe is me, you are so sick of late,
3012	So far from cheer and from your former state,
3013	That I distrust you. Yet, though I distrust,
3014	Discomfort you, my lord, it nothing must:
3015	For women's fear and love holds quantity;
3016	In neither aught, or in extremity.
3017	Now, what my love is, proof hath made you know;
3018	And as my love is sized, my fear is so:
3019	Where love is great, the littlest doubts are fear;
3020	Where little fears grow great, great love grows there.
3021	
3022	Player King	'Faith, I must leave thee, love, and shortly too;
3023	My operant powers their functions leave to do:
3024	And thou shalt live in this fair world behind,
3025	Honour'd, beloved; and haply one as kind
3026	For husband shalt thou--
3027	
3028	Player Queen	O, confound the rest!
3029	Such love must needs be treason in my breast:
3030	In second husband let me be accurst!
3031	None wed the second but who kill'd the first.
3032	
3033	HAMLET	[Aside]  Wormwood, wormwood.
3034	
3035	Player Queen	   The instances that second marriage move
3036	Are base respects of thrift, but none of love:
3037	A second time I kill my husband dead,
3038	When second husband kisses me in bed.
3039	
3040	Player King	   I do believe you think what now you speak;
3041	But what we do determine oft we break.
3042	Purpose is but the slave to memory,
3043	Of violent birth, but poor validity;
3044	Which now, like fruit unripe, sticks on the tree;
3045	But fall, unshaken, when they mellow be.
3046	Most necessary 'tis that we forget
3047	To pay ourselves what to ourselves is debt:
3048	What to ourselves in passion we propose,
3049	The passion ending, doth the purpose lose.
3050	The violence of either grief or joy
3051	Their own enactures with themselves destroy:
3052	Where joy most revels, grief doth most lament;
3053	Grief joys, joy grieves, on slender accident.
3054	This world is not for aye, nor 'tis not strange
3055	That even our loves should with our fortunes change;
3056	For 'tis a question left us yet to prove,
3057	Whether love lead fortune, or else fortune love.
3058	The great man down, you mark his favourite flies;
3059	The poor advanced makes friends of enemies.
3060	And hitherto doth love on fortune tend;
3061	For who not needs shall never lack a friend,
3062	And who in want a hollow friend doth try,
3063	Directly seasons him his enemy.
3064	But, orderly to end where I begun,
3065	Our wills and fates do so contrary run
3066	That our devices still are overthrown;
3067	Our thoughts are ours, their ends none of our own:
3068	So think thou wilt no second husband wed;
3069	But die thy thoughts when thy first lord is dead.
3070	
3071	Player Queen	   Nor earth to me give food, nor heaven light!
3072	Sport and repose lock from me day and night!
3073	To desperation turn my trust and hope!
3074	An anchor's cheer in prison be my scope!
3075	Each opposite that blanks the face of joy
3076	Meet what I would have well and it destroy!
3077	Both here and hence pursue me lasting strife,
3078	If, once a widow, ever I be wife!
3079	
3080	HAMLET	If she should break it now!
3081	
3082	Player King	'Tis deeply sworn. Sweet, leave me here awhile;
3083	My spirits grow dull, and fain I would beguile
3084	The tedious day with sleep.
3085	
3086	[Sleeps]
3087	
3088	Player Queen	Sleep rock thy brain,
3089	And never come mischance between us twain!
3090	
3091	[Exit]
3092	
3093	HAMLET	Madam, how like you this play?
3094	
3095	QUEEN GERTRUDE	The lady protests too much, methinks.
3096	
3097	HAMLET	O, but she'll keep her word.
3098	
3099	KING CLAUDIUS	Have you heard the argument? Is there no offence in 't?
3100	
3101	HAMLET	No, no, they do but jest, poison in jest; no offence
3102	i' the world.
3103	
3104	KING CLAUDIUS	What do you call the play?
3105	
3106	HAMLET	The Mouse-trap. Marry, how? Tropically. This play
3107	is the image of a murder done in Vienna: Gonzago is
3108	the duke's name; his wife, Baptista: you shall see
3109	anon; 'tis a knavish piece of work: but what o'
3110	that? your majesty and we that have free souls, it
3111	touches us not: let the galled jade wince, our
3112	withers are unwrung.
3113	
3114	[Enter LUCIANUS]
3115	
3116	This is one Lucianus, nephew to the king.
3117	
3118	OPHELIA	You are as good as a chorus, my lord.
3119	
3120	HAMLET	I could interpret between you and your love, if I
3121	could see the puppets dallying.
3122	
3123	OPHELIA	You are keen, my lord, you are keen.
3124	
3125	HAMLET	It would cost you a groaning to take off my edge.
3126	
3127	OPHELIA	Still better, and worse.
3128	
3129	HAMLET	So you must take your husbands. Begin, murderer;
3130	pox, leave thy damnable faces, and begin. Come:
3131	'the croaking raven doth bellow for revenge.'
3132	
3133	LUCIANUS	   Thoughts black, hands apt, drugs fit, and time agreeing;
3134	Confederate season, else no creature seeing;
3135	Thou mixture rank, of midnight weeds collected,
3136	With Hecate's ban thrice blasted, thrice infected,
3137	Thy natural magic and dire property,
3138	On wholesome life usurp immediately.
3139	
3140	[Pours the poison into the sleeper's ears]
3141	
3142	HAMLET	He poisons him i' the garden for's estate. His
3143	name's Gonzago: the story is extant, and writ in
3144	choice Italian: you shall see anon how the murderer
3145	gets the love of Gonzago's wife.
3146	
3147	OPHELIA	The king rises.
3148	
3149	HAMLET	What, frighted with false fire!
3150	
3151	QUEEN GERTRUDE	How fares my lord?
3152	
3153	LORD POLONIUS	Give o'er the play.
3154	
3155	KING CLAUDIUS	Give me some light: away!
3156	
3157	All	Lights, lights, lights!
3158	
3159	[Exeunt all but HAMLET and HORATIO]
3160	
3161	HAMLET	     Why, let the stricken deer go weep,
3162	The hart ungalled play;
3163	For some must watch, while some must sleep:
3164	So runs the world away.
3165	Would not this, sir, and a forest of feathers-- if
3166	the rest of my fortunes turn Turk with me--with two
3167	Provincial roses on my razed shoes, get me a
3168	fellowship in a cry of players, sir?
3169	
3170	HORATIO	Half a share.
3171	
3172	HAMLET	A whole one, I.
3173	For thou dost know, O Damon dear,
3174	This realm dismantled was
3175	Of Jove himself; and now reigns here
3176	A very, very--pajock.
3177	
3178	HORATIO	You might have rhymed.
3179	
3180	HAMLET	O good Horatio, I'll take the ghost's word for a
3181	thousand pound. Didst perceive?
3182	
3183	HORATIO	Very well, my lord.
3184	
3185	HAMLET	Upon the talk of the poisoning?
3186	
3187	HORATIO	I did very well note him.
3188	
3189	HAMLET	Ah, ha! Come, some music! come, the recorders!
3190	For if the king like not the comedy,
3191	Why then, belike, he likes it not, perdy.
3192	Come, some music!
3193	
3194	[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
3195	
3196	GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, vouchsafe me a word with you.
3197	
3198	HAMLET	Sir, a whole history.
3199	
3200	GUILDENSTERN	The king, sir,--
3201	
3202	HAMLET	Ay, sir, what of him?
3203	
3204	GUILDENSTERN	Is in his retirement marvellous distempered.
3205	
3206	HAMLET	With drink, sir?
3207	
3208	GUILDENSTERN	No, my lord, rather with choler.
3209	
3210	HAMLET	Your wisdom should show itself more richer to
3211	signify this to his doctor; for, for me to put him
3212	to his purgation would perhaps plunge him into far
3213	more choler.
3214	
3215	GUILDENSTERN	Good my lord, put your discourse into some frame and
3216	start not so wildly from my affair.
3217	
3218	HAMLET	I am tame, sir: pronounce.
3219	
3220	GUILDENSTERN	The queen, your mother, in most great affliction of
3221	spirit, hath sent me to you.
3222	
3223	HAMLET	You are welcome.
3224	
3225	GUILDENSTERN	Nay, good my lord, this courtesy is not of the right
3226	breed. If it shall please you to make me a
3227	wholesome answer, I will do your mother's
3228	commandment: if not, your pardon and my return
3229	shall be the end of my business.
3230	
3231	HAMLET	Sir, I cannot.
3232	
3233	GUILDENSTERN	What, my lord?
3234	
3235	HAMLET	Make you a wholesome answer; my wit's diseased: but,
3236	sir, such answer as I can make, you shall command;
3237	or, rather, as you say, my mother: therefore no
3238	more, but to the matter: my mother, you say,--
3239	
3240	ROSENCRANTZ	Then thus she says; your behavior hath struck her
3241	into amazement and admiration.
3242	
3243	HAMLET	O wonderful son, that can so astonish a mother! But
3244	is there no sequel at the heels of this mother's
3245	admiration? Impart.
3246	
3247	ROSENCRANTZ	She desires to speak with you in her closet, ere you
3248	go to bed.
3249	
3250	HAMLET	We shall obey, were she ten times our mother. Have
3251	you any further trade with us?
3252	
3253	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you once did love me.
3254	
3255	HAMLET	So I do still, by these pickers and stealers.
3256	
3257	ROSENCRANTZ	Good my lord, what is your cause of distemper? you
3258	do, surely, bar the door upon your own liberty, if
3259	you deny your griefs to your friend.
3260	
3261	HAMLET	Sir, I lack advancement.
3262	
3263	ROSENCRANTZ	How can that be, when you have the voice of the king
3264	himself for your succession in Denmark?
3265	
3266	HAMLET	Ay, but sir, 'While the grass grows,'--the proverb
3267	is something musty.
3268	
3269	[Re-enter Players with recorders]
3270	
3271	O, the recorders! let me see one. To withdraw with
3272	you:--why do you go about to recover the wind of me,
3273	as if you would drive me into a toil?
3274	
3275	GUILDENSTERN	O, my lord, if my duty be too bold, my love is too
3276	unmannerly.
3277	
3278	HAMLET	I do not well understand that. Will you play upon
3279	this pipe?
3280	
3281	GUILDENSTERN	My lord, I cannot.
3282	
3283	HAMLET	I pray you.
3284	
3285	GUILDENSTERN	Believe me, I cannot.
3286	
3287	HAMLET	I do beseech you.
3288	
3289	GUILDENSTERN	I know no touch of it, my lord.
3290	
3291	HAMLET	'Tis as easy as lying: govern these ventages with
3292	your lingers and thumb, give it breath with your
3293	mouth, and it will discourse most eloquent music.
3294	Look you, these are the stops.
3295	
3296	GUILDENSTERN	But these cannot I command to any utterance of
3297	harmony; I have not the skill.
3298	
3299	HAMLET	Why, look you now, how unworthy a thing you make of
3300	me! You would play upon me; you would seem to know
3301	my stops; you would pluck out the heart of my
3302	mystery; you would sound me from my lowest note to
3303	the top of my compass: and there is much music,
3304	excellent voice, in this little organ; yet cannot
3305	you make it speak. 'Sblood, do you think I am
3306	easier to be played on than a pipe? Call me what
3307	instrument you will, though you can fret me, yet you
3308	cannot play upon me.
3309	
3310	[Enter POLONIUS]
3311	
3312	God bless you, sir!
3313	
3314	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, the queen would speak with you, and
3315	presently.
3316	
3317	HAMLET	Do you see yonder cloud that's almost in shape of a camel?
3318	
3319	LORD POLONIUS	By the mass, and 'tis like a camel, indeed.
3320	
3321	HAMLET	Methinks it is like a weasel.
3322	
3323	LORD POLONIUS	It is backed like a weasel.
3324	
3325	HAMLET	Or like a whale?
3326	
3327	LORD POLONIUS	Very like a whale.
3328	
3329	HAMLET	Then I will come to my mother by and by. They fool
3330	me to the top of my bent. I will come by and by.
3331	
3332	LORD POLONIUS	I will say so.
3333	
3334	HAMLET	By and by is easily said.
3335	
3336	[Exit POLONIUS]
3337	
3338	Leave me, friends.
3339	
3340	[Exeunt all but HAMLET]
3341	
3342	Tis now the very witching time of night,
3343	When churchyards yawn and hell itself breathes out
3344	Contagion to this world: now could I drink hot blood,
3345	And do such bitter business as the day
3346	Would quake to look on. Soft! now to my mother.
3347	O heart, lose not thy nature; let not ever
3348	The soul of Nero enter this firm bosom:
3349	Let me be cruel, not unnatural:
3350	I will speak daggers to her, but use none;
3351	My tongue and soul in this be hypocrites;
3352	How in my words soever she be shent,
3353	To give them seals never, my soul, consent!

3366	SCENE III	A room in the castle.
3367	
3368	
3369	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, ROSENCRANTZ, and GUILDENSTERN]
3370	
3371	KING CLAUDIUS	I like him not, nor stands it safe with us
3372	To let his madness range. Therefore prepare you;
3373	I your commission will forthwith dispatch,
3374	And he to England shall along with you:
3375	The terms of our estate may not endure
3376	Hazard so dangerous as doth hourly grow
3377	Out of his lunacies.
3378	
3379	GUILDENSTERN	We will ourselves provide:
3380	Most holy and religious fear it is
3381	To keep those many many bodies safe
3382	That live and feed upon your majesty.
3383	
3384	ROSENCRANTZ	The single and peculiar life is bound,
3385	With all the strength and armour of the mind,
3386	To keep itself from noyance; but much more
3387	That spirit upon whose weal depend and rest
3388	The lives of many. The cease of majesty
3389	Dies not alone; but, like a gulf, doth draw
3390	What's near it with it: it is a massy wheel,
3391	Fix'd on the summit of the highest mount,
3392	To whose huge spokes ten thousand lesser things
3393	Are mortised and adjoin'd; which, when it falls,
3394	Each small annexment, petty consequence,
3395	Attends the boisterous ruin. Never alone
3396	Did the king sigh, but with a general groan.
3397	
3398	KING CLAUDIUS	Arm you, I pray you, to this speedy voyage;
3399	For we will fetters put upon this fear,
3400	Which now goes too free-footed.
3401	
3402	
3403	ROSENCRANTZ	|
3404	|	We will haste us.

3408	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
3409	
3410	[Enter POLONIUS]
3411	
3412	LORD POLONIUS	My lord, he's going to his mother's closet:
3413	Behind the arras I'll convey myself,
3414	To hear the process; and warrant she'll tax him home:
3415	And, as you said, and wisely was it said,
3416	'Tis meet that some more audience than a mother,
3417	Since nature makes them partial, should o'erhear
3418	The speech, of vantage. Fare you well, my liege:
3419	I'll call upon you ere you go to bed,
3420	And tell you what I know.
3421	
3422	KING CLAUDIUS	Thanks, dear my lord.
3423	
3424	[Exit POLONIUS]
3425	
3426	O, my offence is rank it smells to heaven;
3427	It hath the primal eldest curse upon't,
3428	A brother's murder. Pray can I not,
3429	Though inclination be as sharp as will:
3430	My stronger guilt defeats my strong intent;
3431	And, like a man to double business bound,
3432	I stand in pause where I shall first begin,
3433	And both neglect. What if this cursed hand
3434	Were thicker than itself with brother's blood,
3435	Is there not rain enough in the sweet heavens
3436	To wash it white as snow? Whereto serves mercy
3437	But to confront the visage of offence?
3438	And what's in prayer but this two-fold force,
3439	To be forestalled ere we come to fall,
3440	Or pardon'd being down? Then I'll look up;
3441	My fault is past. But, O, what form of prayer
3442	Can serve my turn? 'Forgive me my foul murder'?
3443	That cannot be; since I am still possess'd
3444	Of those effects for which I did the murder,
3445	My crown, mine own ambition and my queen.
3446	May one be pardon'd and retain the offence?
3447	In the corrupted currents of this world
3448	Offence's gilded hand may shove by justice,
3449	And oft 'tis seen the wicked prize itself
3450	Buys out the law: but 'tis not so above;
3451	There is no shuffling, there the action lies
3452	In his true nature; and we ourselves compell'd,
3453	Even to the teeth and forehead of our faults,
3454	To give in evidence. What then? what rests?
3455	Try what repentance can: what can it not?
3456	Yet what can it when one can not repent?
3457	O wretched state! O bosom black as death!
3458	O limed soul, that, struggling to be free,
3459	Art more engaged! Help, angels! Make assay!
3460	Bow, stubborn knees; and, heart with strings of steel,
3461	Be soft as sinews of the newborn babe!
3462	All may be well.
3463	
3464	[Retires and kneels]
3465	
3466	[Enter HAMLET]
3467	
3468	HAMLET	Now might I do it pat, now he is praying;
3469	And now I'll do't. And so he goes to heaven;
3470	And so am I revenged. That would be scann'd:
3471	A villain kills my father; and for that,
3472	I, his sole son, do this same villain send
3473	To heaven.
3474	O, this is hire and salary, not revenge.
3475	He took my father grossly, full of bread;
3476	With all his crimes broad blown, as flush as May;
3477	And how his audit stands who knows save heaven?
3478	But in our circumstance and course of thought,
3479	'Tis heavy with him: and am I then revenged,
3480	To take him in the purging of his soul,
3481	When he is fit and season'd for his passage?
3482	No!
3483	Up, sword; and know thou a more horrid hent:
3484	When he is drunk asleep, or in his rage,
3485	Or in the incestuous pleasure of his bed;
3486	At gaming, swearing, or about some act
3487	That has no relish of salvation in't;
3488	Then trip him, that his heels may kick at heaven,
3489	And that his soul may be as damn'd and black
3490	As hell, whereto it goes. My mother stays:
3491	This physic but prolongs thy sickly days.
3492	
3493	[Exit]
3494	
3495	KING CLAUDIUS	[Rising]  My words fly up, my thoughts remain below:

3511	
3512	
3513	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and POLONIUS]
3514	
3515	LORD POLONIUS	He will come straight. Look you lay home to him:
3516	Tell him his pranks have been too broad to bear with,
3517	And that your grace hath screen'd and stood between
3518	Much heat and him. I'll sconce me even here.
3519	Pray you, be round with him.
3520	
3521	HAMLET	[Within]  Mother, mother, mother!
3522	
3523	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I'll warrant you,
3524	Fear me not: withdraw, I hear him coming.
3525	
3526	[POLONIUS hides behind the arras]
3527	
3528	[Enter HAMLET]
3529	
3530	HAMLET	Now, mother, what's the matter?
3531	
3532	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Hamlet, thou hast thy father much offended.
3533	
3534	HAMLET	Mother, you have my father much offended.
3535	
3536	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come, come, you answer with an idle tongue.
3537	
3538	HAMLET	Go, go, you question with a wicked tongue.
3539	
3540	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Why, how now, Hamlet!
3541	
3542	HAMLET	What's the matter now?
3543	
3544	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Have you forgot me?
3545	
3546	HAMLET	No, by the rood, not so:
3547	You are the queen, your husband's brother's wife;
3548	And--would it were not so!--you are my mother.
3549	
3550	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nay, then, I'll set those to you that can speak.
3551	
3552	HAMLET	Come, come, and sit you down; you shall not budge;
3553	You go not till I set you up a glass
3554	Where you may see the inmost part of you.
3555	
3556	QUEEN GERTRUDE	What wilt thou do? thou wilt not murder me?
3557	Help, help, ho!
3558	
3559	LORD POLONIUS	[Behind]  What, ho! help, help, help!
3560	
3561	HAMLET	[Drawing]  How now! a rat? Dead, for a ducat, dead!
3562	
3563	[Makes a pass through the arras]
3564	
3565	LORD POLONIUS	[Behind]  O, I am slain!
3566	
3567	[Falls and dies]
3568	
3569	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O me, what hast thou done?
3570	
3571	HAMLET	Nay, I know not:
3572	Is it the king?
3573	
3574	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, what a rash and bloody deed is this!
3575	
3576	HAMLET	A bloody deed! almost as bad, good mother,
3577	As kill a king, and marry with his brother.
3578	
3579	QUEEN GERTRUDE	As kill a king!
3580	
3581	HAMLET	                  Ay, lady, 'twas my word.
3582	
3583	[Lifts up the array and discovers POLONIUS]
3584	
3585	Thou wretched, rash, intruding fool, farewell!
3586	I took thee for thy better: take thy fortune;
3587	Thou find'st to be too busy is some danger.
3588	Leave wringing of your hands: peace! sit you down,
3589	And let me wring your heart; for so I shall,
3590	If it be made of penetrable stuff,
3591	If damned custom have not brass'd it so
3592	That it is proof and bulwark against sense.
3593	
3594	QUEEN GERTRUDE	What have I done, that thou darest wag thy tongue
3595	In noise so rude against me?
3596	
3597	HAMLET	Such an act
3598	That blurs the grace and blush of modesty,
3599	Calls virtue hypocrite, takes off the rose
3600	From the fair forehead of an innocent love
3601	And sets a blister there, makes marriage-vows
3602	As false as dicers' oaths: O, such a deed
3603	As from the body of contraction plucks
3604	The very soul, and sweet religion makes
3605	A rhapsody of words: heaven's face doth glow:
3606	Yea, this solidity and compound mass,
3607	With tristful visage, as against the doom,
3608	Is thought-sick at the act.
3609	
3610	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Ay me, what act,
3611	That roars so loud, and thunders in the index?
3612	
3613	HAMLET	Look here, upon this picture, and on this,
3614	The counterfeit presentment of two brothers.
3615	See, what a grace was seated on this brow;
3616	Hyperion's curls; the front of Jove himself;
3617	An eye like Mars, to threaten and command;
3618	A station like the herald Mercury
3619	New-lighted on a heaven-kissing hill;
3620	A combination and a form indeed,
3621	Where every god did seem to set his seal,
3622	To give the world assurance of a man:
3623	This was your husband. Look you now, what follows:
3624	Here is your husband; like a mildew'd ear,
3625	Blasting his wholesome brother. Have you eyes?
3626	Could you on this fair mountain leave to feed,
3627	And batten on this moor? Ha! have you eyes?
3628	You cannot call it love; for at your age
3629	The hey-day in the blood is tame, it's humble,
3630	And waits upon the judgment: and what judgment
3631	Would step from this to this? Sense, sure, you have,
3632	Else could you not have motion; but sure, that sense
3633	Is apoplex'd; for madness would not err,
3634	Nor sense to ecstasy was ne'er so thrall'd
3635	But it reserved some quantity of choice,
3636	To serve in such a difference. What devil was't
3637	That thus hath cozen'd you at hoodman-blind?
3638	Eyes without feeling, feeling without sight,
3639	Ears without hands or eyes, smelling sans all,
3640	Or but a sickly part of one true sense
3641	Could not so mope.
3642	O shame! where is thy blush? Rebellious hell,
3643	If thou canst mutine in a matron's bones,
3644	To flaming youth let virtue be as wax,
3645	And melt in her own fire: proclaim no shame
3646	When the compulsive ardour gives the charge,
3647	Since frost itself as actively doth burn
3648	And reason panders will.
3649	
3650	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, speak no more:
3651	Thou turn'st mine eyes into my very soul;
3652	And there I see such black and grained spots
3653	As will not leave their tinct.
3654	
3655	HAMLET	Nay, but to live
3656	In the rank sweat of an enseamed bed,
3657	Stew'd in corruption, honeying and making love
3658	Over the nasty sty,--
3659	
3660	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O, speak to me no more;
3661	These words, like daggers, enter in mine ears;
3662	No more, sweet Hamlet!
3663	
3664	HAMLET	A murderer and a villain;
3665	A slave that is not twentieth part the tithe
3666	Of your precedent lord; a vice of kings;
3667	A cutpurse of the empire and the rule,
3668	That from a shelf the precious diadem stole,
3669	And put it in his pocket!
3670	
3671	QUEEN GERTRUDE	No more!
3672	
3673	HAMLET	A king of shreds and patches,--
3674	
3675	[Enter Ghost]
3676	
3677	Save me, and hover o'er me with your wings,
3678	You heavenly guards! What would your gracious figure?
3679	
3680	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, he's mad!
3681	
3682	HAMLET	Do you not come your tardy son to chide,
3683	That, lapsed in time and passion, lets go by
3684	The important acting of your dread command? O, say!
3685	
3686	Ghost	Do not forget: this visitation
3687	Is but to whet thy almost blunted purpose.
3688	But, look, amazement on thy mother sits:
3689	O, step between her and her fighting soul:
3690	Conceit in weakest bodies strongest works:
3691	Speak to her, Hamlet.
3692	
3693	HAMLET	How is it with you, lady?
3694	
3695	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, how is't with you,
3696	That you do bend your eye on vacancy
3697	And with the incorporal air do hold discourse?
3698	Forth at your eyes your spirits wildly peep;
3699	And, as the sleeping soldiers in the alarm,
3700	Your bedded hair, like life in excrements,
3701	Starts up, and stands on end. O gentle son,
3702	Upon the heat and flame of thy distemper
3703	Sprinkle cool patience. Whereon do you look?
3704	
3705	HAMLET	On him, on him! Look you, how pale he glares!
3706	His form and cause conjoin'd, preaching to stones,
3707	Would make them capable. Do not look upon me;
3708	Lest with this piteous action you convert
3709	My stern effects: then what I have to do
3710	Will want true colour; tears perchance for blood.
3711	
3712	QUEEN GERTRUDE	To whom do you speak this?
3713	
3714	HAMLET	Do you see nothing there?
3715	
3716	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nothing at all; yet all that is I see.
3717	
3718	HAMLET	Nor did you nothing hear?
3719	
3720	QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, nothing but ourselves.
3721	
3722	HAMLET	Why, look you there! look, how it steals away!
3723	My father, in his habit as he lived!
3724	Look, where he goes, even now, out at the portal!
3725	
3726	[Exit Ghost]
3727	
3728	QUEEN GERTRUDE	This the very coinage of your brain:
3729	This bodiless creation ecstasy
3730	Is very cunning in.
3731	
3732	HAMLET	Ecstasy!
3733	My pulse, as yours, doth temperately keep time,
3734	And makes as healthful music: it is not madness
3735	That I have utter'd: bring me to the test,
3736	And I the matter will re-word; which madness
3737	Would gambol from. Mother, for love of grace,
3738	Lay not that mattering unction to your soul,
3739	That not your trespass, but my madness speaks:
3740	It will but skin and film the ulcerous place,
3741	Whilst rank corruption, mining all within,
3742	Infects unseen. Confess yourself to heaven;
3743	Repent what's past; avoid what is to come;
3744	And do not spread the compost on the weeds,
3745	To make them ranker. Forgive me this my virtue;
3746	For in the fatness of these pursy times
3747	Virtue itself of vice must pardon beg,
3748	Yea, curb and woo for leave to do him good.
3749	
3750	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O Hamlet, thou hast cleft my heart in twain.
3751	
3752	HAMLET	O, throw away the worser part of it,
3753	And live the purer with the other half.
3754	Good night: but go not to mine uncle's bed;
3755	Assume a virtue, if you have it not.
3756	That monster, custom, who all sense doth eat,
3757	Of habits devil, is angel yet in this,
3758	That to the use of actions fair and good
3759	He likewise gives a frock or livery,
3760	That aptly is put on. Refrain to-night,
3761	And that shall lend a kind of easiness
3762	To the next abstinence: the next more easy;
3763	For use almost can change the stamp of nature,
3764	And either [         ] the devil, or throw him out
3765	With wondrous potency. Once more, good night:
3766	And when you are desirous to be bless'd,
3767	I'll blessing beg of you. For this same lord,
3768	
3769	[Pointing to POLONIUS]
3770	
3771	I do repent: but heaven hath pleased it so,
3772	To punish me with this and this with me,
3773	That I must be their scourge and minister.
3774	I will bestow him, and will answer well
3775	The death I gave him. So, again, good night.
3776	I must be cruel, only to be kind:
3777	Thus bad begins and worse remains behind.
3778	One word more, good lady.
3779	
3780	QUEEN GERTRUDE	What shall I do?
3781	
3782	HAMLET	Not this, by no means, that I bid you do:
3783	Let the bloat king tempt you again to bed;
3784	Pinch wanton on your cheek; call you his mouse;
3785	And let him, for a pair of reechy kisses,
3786	Or paddling in your neck with his damn'd fingers,
3787	Make you to ravel all this matter out,
3788	That I essentially am not in madness,
3789	But mad in craft. 'Twere good you let him know;
3790	For who, that's but a queen, fair, sober, wise,
3791	Would from a paddock, from a bat, a gib,
3792	Such dear concernings hide? who would do so?
3793	No, in despite of sense and secrecy,
3794	Unpeg the basket on the house's top.
3795	Let the birds fly, and, like the famous ape,
3796	To try conclusions, in the basket creep,
3797	And break your own neck down.
3798	
3799	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Be thou assured, if words be made of breath,
3800	And breath of life, I have no life to breathe
3801	What thou hast said to me.
3802	
3803	HAMLET	I must to England; you know that?
3804	
3805	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack,
3806	I had forgot: 'tis so concluded on.
3807	
3808	HAMLET	There's letters seal'd: and my two schoolfellows,
3809	Whom I will trust as I will adders fang'd,
3810	They bear the mandate; they must sweep my way,
3811	And marshal me to knavery. Let it work;
3812	For 'tis the sport to have the engineer
3813	Hoist with his own petard: and 't shall go hard
3814	But I will delve one yard below their mines,
3815	And blow them at the moon: O, 'tis most sweet,
3816	When in one line two crafts directly meet.
3817	This man shall set me packing:
3818	I'll lug the guts into the neighbour room.
3819	Mother, good night. Indeed this counsellor
3820	Is now most still, most secret and most grave,
3821	Who was in life a foolish prating knave.
3822	Come, sir, to draw toward an end with you.
3823	Good night, mother.

3838	
3839	
3840	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, ROSENCRANTZ,
3841	and GUILDENSTERN]
3842	
3843	KING CLAUDIUS	There's matter in these sighs, these profound heaves:
3844	You must translate: 'tis fit we understand them.
3845	Where is your son?
3846	
3847	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Bestow this place on us a little while.
3848	
3849	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
3850	
3851	Ah, my good lord, what have I seen to-night!
3852	
3853	KING CLAUDIUS	What, Gertrude? How does Hamlet?
3854	
3855	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Mad as the sea and wind, when both contend
3856	Which is the mightier: in his lawless fit,
3857	Behind the arras hearing something stir,
3858	Whips out his rapier, cries, 'A rat, a rat!'
3859	And, in this brainish apprehension, kills
3860	The unseen good old man.
3861	
3862	KING CLAUDIUS	O heavy deed!
3863	It had been so with us, had we been there:
3864	His liberty is full of threats to all;
3865	To you yourself, to us, to every one.
3866	Alas, how shall this bloody deed be answer'd?
3867	It will be laid to us, whose providence
3868	Should have kept short, restrain'd and out of haunt,
3869	This mad young man: but so much was our love,
3870	We would not understand what was most fit;
3871	But, like the owner of a foul disease,
3872	To keep it from divulging, let it feed
3873	Even on the pith of Life. Where is he gone?
3874	
3875	QUEEN GERTRUDE	To draw apart the body he hath kill'd:
3876	O'er whom his very madness, like some ore
3877	Among a mineral of metals base,
3878	Shows itself pure; he weeps for what is done.
3879	
3880	KING CLAUDIUS	O Gertrude, come away!
3881	The sun no sooner shall the mountains touch,
3882	But we will ship him hence: and this vile deed
3883	We must, with all our majesty and skill,
3884	Both countenance and excuse. Ho, Guildenstern!
3885	
3886	[Re-enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
3887	
3888	Friends both, go join you with some further aid:
3889	Hamlet in madness hath Polonius slain,
3890	And from his mother's closet hath he dragg'd him:
3891	Go seek him out; speak fair, and bring the body
3892	Into the chapel. I pray you, haste in this.
3893	
3894	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
3895	
3896	Come, Gertrude, we'll call up our wisest friends;
3897	And let them know, both what we mean to do,
3898	And what's untimely done [                ]
3899	Whose whisper o'er the world's diameter,
3900	As level as the cannon to his blank,
3901	Transports his poison'd shot, may miss our name,
3902	And hit the woundless air. O, come away!
3903	My soul is full of discord and dismay.

3927	GUILDENSTERN:	|
3928	
3929	
3930	HAMLET	What noise? who calls on Hamlet?
3931	O, here they come.
3932	
3933	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
3934	
3935	ROSENCRANTZ	What have you done, my lord, with the dead body?
3936	
3937	HAMLET	Compounded it with dust, whereto 'tis kin.
3938	
3939	ROSENCRANTZ	Tell us where 'tis, that we may take it thence
3940	And bear it to the chapel.
3941	
3942	HAMLET	Do not believe it.
3943	
3944	ROSENCRANTZ	Believe what?
3945	
3946	HAMLET	That I can keep your counsel and not mine own.
3947	Besides, to be demanded of a sponge! what
3948	replication should be made by the son of a king?
3949	
3950	ROSENCRANTZ	Take you me for a sponge, my lord?
3951	
3952	HAMLET	Ay, sir, that soaks up the king's countenance, his
3953	rewards, his authorities. But such officers do the
3954	king best service in the end: he keeps them, like
3955	an ape, in the corner of his jaw; first mouthed, to
3956	be last swallowed: when he needs what you have
3957	gleaned, it is but squeezing you, and, sponge, you
3958	shall be dry again.
3959	
3960	ROSENCRANTZ	I understand you not, my lord.
3961	
3962	HAMLET	I am glad of it: a knavish speech sleeps in a
3963	foolish ear.
3964	
3965	ROSENCRANTZ	My lord, you must tell us where the body is, and go
3966	with us to the king.
3967	
3968	HAMLET	The body is with the king, but the king is not with
3969	the body. The king is a thing--
3970	
3971	GUILDENSTERN	A thing, my lord!
3972	
3973	HAMLET	Of nothing: bring me to him. Hide fox, and all after.

3988	
3989	
3990	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, attended]
3991	
3992	KING CLAUDIUS	I have sent to seek him, and to find the body.
3993	How dangerous is it that this man goes loose!
3994	Yet must not we put the strong law on him:
3995	He's loved of the distracted multitude,
3996	Who like not in their judgment, but their eyes;
3997	And where tis so, the offender's scourge is weigh'd,
3998	But never the offence. To bear all smooth and even,
3999	This sudden sending him away must seem
4000	Deliberate pause: diseases desperate grown
4001	By desperate appliance are relieved,
4002	Or not at all.
4003	
4004	[Enter ROSENCRANTZ]
4005	
4006	How now! what hath befall'n?
4007	
4008	ROSENCRANTZ	Where the dead body is bestow'd, my lord,
4009	We cannot get from him.
4010	
4011	KING CLAUDIUS	But where is he?
4012	
4013	ROSENCRANTZ	Without, my lord; guarded, to know your pleasure.
4014	
4015	KING CLAUDIUS	Bring him before us.
4016	
4017	ROSENCRANTZ	Ho, Guildenstern! bring in my lord.
4018	
4019	[Enter HAMLET and GUILDENSTERN]
4020	
4021	KING CLAUDIUS	Now, Hamlet, where's Polonius?
4022	
4023	HAMLET	At supper.
4024	
4025	KING CLAUDIUS	At supper! where?
4026	
4027	HAMLET	Not where he eats, but where he is eaten: a certain
4028	convocation of politic worms are e'en at him. Your
4029	worm is your only emperor for diet: we fat all
4030	creatures else to fat us, and we fat ourselves for
4031	maggots: your fat king and your lean beggar is but
4032	variable service, two dishes, but to one table:
4033	that's the end.
4034	
4035	KING CLAUDIUS	Alas, alas!
4036	
4037	HAMLET	A man may fish with the worm that hath eat of a
4038	king, and cat of the fish that hath fed of that worm.
4039	
4040	KING CLAUDIUS	What dost you mean by this?
4041	
4042	HAMLET	Nothing but to show you how a king may go a
4043	progress through the guts of a beggar.
4044	
4045	KING CLAUDIUS	Where is Polonius?
4046	
4047	HAMLET	In heaven; send hither to see: if your messenger
4048	find him not there, seek him i' the other place
4049	yourself. But indeed, if you find him not within
4050	this month, you shall nose him as you go up the
4051	stairs into the lobby.
4052	
4053	KING CLAUDIUS	Go seek him there.
4054	
4055	[To some Attendants]
4056	
4057	HAMLET	He will stay till ye come.
4058	
4059	[Exeunt Attendants]
4060	
4061	KING CLAUDIUS	Hamlet, this deed, for thine especial safety,--
4062	Which we do tender, as we dearly grieve
4063	For that which thou hast done,--must send thee hence
4064	With fiery quickness: therefore prepare thyself;
4065	The bark is ready, and the wind at help,
4066	The associates tend, and every thing is bent
4067	For England.
4068	
4069	HAMLET	                  For England!
4070	
4071	KING CLAUDIUS	Ay, Hamlet.
4072	
4073	HAMLET	Good.
4074	
4075	KING CLAUDIUS	So is it, if thou knew'st our purposes.
4076	
4077	HAMLET	I see a cherub that sees them. But, come; for
4078	England! Farewell, dear mother.
4079	
4080	KING CLAUDIUS	Thy loving father, Hamlet.
4081	
4082	HAMLET	My mother: father and mother is man and wife; man
4083	and wife is one flesh; and so, my mother. Come, for England!
4084	
4085	[Exit]
4086	
4087	KING CLAUDIUS	Follow him at foot; tempt him with speed aboard;
4088	Delay it not; I'll have him hence to-night:
4089	Away! for every thing is seal'd and done
4090	That else leans on the affair: pray you, make haste.
4091	
4092	[Exeunt ROSENCRANTZ and GUILDENSTERN]
4093	
4094	And, England, if my love thou hold'st at aught--
4095	As my great power thereof may give thee sense,
4096	Since yet thy cicatrice looks raw and red
4097	After the Danish sword, and thy free awe
4098	Pays homage to us--thou mayst not coldly set
4099	Our sovereign process; which imports at full,
4100	By letters congruing to that effect,
4101	The present death of Hamlet. Do it, England;
4102	For like the hectic in my blood he rages,
4103	And thou must cure me: till I know 'tis done,
4104	Howe'er my haps, my joys were ne'er begun.

4124	Tell him that, by his licence, Fortinbras
4125	Craves the conveyance of a promised march
4126	Over his kingdom. You know the rendezvous.
4127	If that his majesty would aught with us,
4128	We shall express our duty in his eye;
4129	And let him know so.
4130	
4131	Captain	I will do't, my lord.

4138	
4139	HAMLET	Good sir, whose powers are these?
4140	
4141	Captain	They are of Norway, sir.
4142	
4143	HAMLET	How purposed, sir, I pray you?
4144	
4145	Captain	Against some part of Poland.
4146	
4147	HAMLET	Who commands them, sir?
4148	
4149	Captain	The nephews to old Norway, Fortinbras.
4150	
4151	HAMLET	Goes it against the main of Poland, sir,
4152	Or for some frontier?
4153	
4154	Captain	Truly to speak, and with no addition,
4155	We go to gain a little patch of ground
4156	That hath in it no profit but the name.
4157	To pay five ducats, five, I would not farm it;
4158	Nor will it yield to Norway or the Pole
4159	A ranker rate, should it be sold in fee.
4160	
4161	HAMLET	Why, then the Polack never will defend it.
4162	
4163	Captain	Yes, it is already garrison'd.
4164	
4165	HAMLET	Two thousand souls and twenty thousand ducats
4166	Will not debate the question of this straw:
4167	This is the imposthume of much wealth and peace,
4168	That inward breaks, and shows no cause without
4169	Why the man dies. I humbly thank you, sir.
4170	
4171	Captain	God be wi' you, sir.
4172	
4173	[Exit]
4174	
4175	ROSENCRANTZ	Wilt please you go, my lord?

4177	HAMLET	I'll be with you straight go a little before.
4178	
4179	[Exeunt all except HAMLET]
4180	
4181	How all occasions do inform against me,
4182	And spur my dull revenge! What is a man,
4183	If his chief good and market of his time
4184	Be but to sleep and feed? a beast, no more.
4185	Sure, he that made us with such large discourse,
4186	Looking before and after, gave us not
4187	That capability and god-like reason
4188	To fust in us unused. Now, whether it be
4189	Bestial oblivion, or some craven scruple
4190	Of thinking too precisely on the event,
4191	A thought which, quarter'd, hath but one part wisdom
4192	And ever three parts coward, I do not know
4193	Why yet I live to say 'This thing's to do;'
4194	Sith I have cause and will and strength and means
4195	To do't. Examples gross as earth exhort me:
4196	Witness this army of such mass and charge
4197	Led by a delicate and tender prince,
4198	Whose spirit with divine ambition puff'd
4199	Makes mouths at the invisible event,
4200	Exposing what is mortal and unsure
4201	To all that fortune, death and danger dare,
4202	Even for an egg-shell. Rightly to be great
4203	Is not to stir without great argument,
4204	But greatly to find quarrel in a straw
4205	When honour's at the stake. How stand I then,
4206	That have a father kill'd, a mother stain'd,
4207	Excitements of my reason and my blood,
4208	And let all sleep? while, to my shame, I see
4209	The imminent death of twenty thousand men,
4210	That, for a fantasy and trick of fame,
4211	Go to their graves like beds, fight for a plot
4212	Whereon the numbers cannot try the cause,
4213	Which is not tomb enough and continent
4214	To hide the slain? O, from this time forth,
4215	My thoughts be bloody, or be nothing worth!

4228	SCENE V	Elsinore. A room in the castle.
4229	
4230	
4231	[Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE, HORATIO, and a Gentleman]
4232	
4233	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I will not speak with her.
4234	
4235	Gentleman	She is importunate, indeed distract:
4236	Her mood will needs be pitied.
4237	
4238	QUEEN GERTRUDE	What would she have?
4239	
4240	Gentleman	She speaks much of her father; says she hears
4241	There's tricks i' the world; and hems, and beats her heart;
4242	Spurns enviously at straws; speaks things in doubt,
4243	That carry but half sense: her speech is nothing,
4244	Yet the unshaped use of it doth move
4245	The hearers to collection; they aim at it,
4246	And botch the words up fit to their own thoughts;
4247	Which, as her winks, and nods, and gestures
4248	yield them,
4249	Indeed would make one think there might be thought,
4250	Though nothing sure, yet much unhappily.
4251	
4252	HORATIO	'Twere good she were spoken with; for she may strew
4253	Dangerous conjectures in ill-breeding minds.
4254	
4255	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Let her come in.
4256	
4257	[Exit HORATIO]
4258	
4259	To my sick soul, as sin's true nature is,
4260	Each toy seems prologue to some great amiss:
4261	So full of artless jealousy is guilt,
4262	It spills itself in fearing to be spilt.
4263	
4264	[Re-enter HORATIO, with OPHELIA]
4265	
4266	OPHELIA	Where is the beauteous majesty of Denmark?
4267	
4268	QUEEN GERTRUDE	How now, Ophelia!
4269	
4270	OPHELIA	[Sings]
4271	
4272	How should I your true love know
4273	From another one?
4274	By his cockle hat and staff,
4275	And his sandal shoon.
4276	
4277	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, sweet lady, what imports this song?
4278	
4279	OPHELIA	Say you? nay, pray you, mark.
4280	
4281	[Sings]
4282	
4283	He is dead and gone, lady,
4284	He is dead and gone;
4285	At his head a grass-green turf,
4286	At his heels a stone.
4287	
4288	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Nay, but, Ophelia,--
4289	
4290	OPHELIA	Pray you, mark.
4291	
4292	[Sings]
4293	
4294	White his shroud as the mountain snow,--
4295	
4296	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS]
4297	
4298	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alas, look here, my lord.
4299	
4300	OPHELIA	[Sings]
4301	
4302	Larded with sweet flowers
4303	Which bewept to the grave did go
4304	With true-love showers.
4305	
4306	KING CLAUDIUS	How do you, pretty lady?
4307	
4308	OPHELIA	Well, God 'ild you! They say the owl was a baker's
4309	daughter. Lord, we know what we are, but know not
4310	what we may be. God be at your table!
4311	
4312	KING CLAUDIUS	Conceit upon her father.
4313	
4314	OPHELIA	Pray you, let's have no words of this; but when they
4315	ask you what it means, say you this:
4316	
4317	[Sings]
4318	
4319	To-morrow is Saint Valentine's day,
4320	All in the morning betime,
4321	And I a maid at your window,
4322	To be your Valentine.
4323	Then up he rose, and donn'd his clothes,
4324	And dupp'd the chamber-door;
4325	Let in the maid, that out a maid
4326	Never departed more.
4327	
4328	KING CLAUDIUS	Pretty Ophelia!
4329	
4330	OPHELIA	Indeed, la, without an oath, I'll make an end on't:
4331	
4332	[Sings]
4333	
4334	By Gis and by Saint Charity,
4335	Alack, and fie for shame!
4336	Young men will do't, if they come to't;
4337	By cock, they are to blame.
4338	Quoth she, before you tumbled me,
4339	You promised me to wed.
4340	So would I ha' done, by yonder sun,
4341	An thou hadst not come to my bed.
4342	
4343	KING CLAUDIUS	How long hath she been thus?
4344	
4345	OPHELIA	I hope all will be well. We must be patient: but I
4346	cannot choose but weep, to think they should lay him
4347	i' the cold ground. My brother shall know of it:
4348	and so I thank you for your good counsel. Come, my
4349	coach! Good night, ladies; good night, sweet ladies;
4350	good night, good night.
4351	
4352	[Exit]
4353	
4354	KING CLAUDIUS	Follow her close; give her good watch,
4355	I pray you.
4356	
4357	[Exit HORATIO]
4358	
4359	O, this is the poison of deep grief; it springs
4360	All from her father's death. O Gertrude, Gertrude,
4361	When sorrows come, they come not single spies
4362	But in battalions. First, her father slain:
4363	Next, your son gone; and he most violent author
4364	Of his own just remove: the people muddied,
4365	Thick and unwholesome in their thoughts and whispers,
4366	For good Polonius' death; and we have done but greenly,
4367	In hugger-mugger to inter him: poor Ophelia
4368	Divided from herself and her fair judgment,
4369	Without the which we are pictures, or mere beasts:
4370	Last, and as much containing as all these,
4371	Her brother is in secret come from France;
4372	Feeds on his wonder, keeps himself in clouds,
4373	And wants not buzzers to infect his ear
4374	With pestilent speeches of his father's death;
4375	Wherein necessity, of matter beggar'd,
4376	Will nothing stick our person to arraign
4377	In ear and ear. O my dear Gertrude, this,
4378	Like to a murdering-piece, in many places
4379	Gives me superfluous death.
4380	
4381	[A noise within]
4382	
4383	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Alack, what noise is this?
4384	
4385	KING CLAUDIUS	Where are my Switzers? Let them guard the door.
4386	
4387	[Enter another Gentleman]
4388	
4389	What is the matter?
4390	
4391	Gentleman	Save yourself, my lord:
4392	The ocean, overpeering of his list,
4393	Eats not the flats with more impetuous haste
4394	Than young Laertes, in a riotous head,
4395	O'erbears your officers. The rabble call him lord;
4396	And, as the world were now but to begin,
4397	Antiquity forgot, custom not known,
4398	The ratifiers and props of every word,
4399	They cry 'Choose we: Laertes shall be king:'
4400	Caps, hands, and tongues, applaud it to the clouds:
4401	'Laertes shall be king, Laertes king!'
4402	
4403	QUEEN GERTRUDE	How cheerfully on the false trail they cry!
4404	O, this is counter, you false Danish dogs!
4405	
4406	KING CLAUDIUS	The doors are broke.
4407	
4408	[Noise within]
4409	
4410	[Enter LAERTES, armed; Danes following]
4411	
4412	LAERTES	Where is this king? Sirs, stand you all without.
4413	
4414	Danes	No, let's come in.
4415	
4416	LAERTES	                  I pray you, give me leave.
4417	
4418	Danes	We will, we will.
4419	
4420	[They retire without the door]
4421	
4422	LAERTES	I thank you: keep the door. O thou vile king,
4423	Give me my father!
4424	
4425	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  Calmly, good Laertes.
4426	
4427	LAERTES	That drop of blood that's calm proclaims me bastard,
4428	Cries cuckold to my father, brands the harlot
4429	Even here, between the chaste unsmirched brow
4430	Of my true mother.
4431	
4432	KING CLAUDIUS	                  What is the cause, Laertes,
4433	That thy rebellion looks so giant-like?
4434	Let him go, Gertrude; do not fear our person:
4435	There's such divinity doth hedge a king,
4436	That treason can but peep to what it would,
4437	Acts little of his will. Tell me, Laertes,
4438	Why thou art thus incensed. Let him go, Gertrude.
4439	Speak, man.
4440	
4441	LAERTES	Where is my father?
4442	
4443	KING CLAUDIUS	Dead.
4444	
4445	QUEEN GERTRUDE	But not by him.
4446	
4447	KING CLAUDIUS	Let him demand his fill.
4448	
4449	LAERTES	How came he dead? I'll not be juggled with:
4450	To hell, allegiance! vows, to the blackest devil!
4451	Conscience and grace, to the profoundest pit!
4452	I dare damnation. To this point I stand,
4453	That both the worlds I give to negligence,
4454	Let come what comes; only I'll be revenged
4455	Most thoroughly for my father.
4456	
4457	KING CLAUDIUS	Who shall stay you?
4458	
4459	LAERTES	My will, not all the world:
4460	And for my means, I'll husband them so well,
4461	They shall go far with little.
4462	
4463	KING CLAUDIUS	Good Laertes,
4464	If you desire to know the certainty
4465	Of your dear father's death, is't writ in your revenge,
4466	That, swoopstake, you will draw both friend and foe,
4467	Winner and loser?
4468	
4469	LAERTES	None but his enemies.
4470	
4471	KING CLAUDIUS	Will you know them then?
4472	
4473	LAERTES	To his good friends thus wide I'll ope my arms;
4474	And like the kind life-rendering pelican,
4475	Repast them with my blood.
4476	
4477	KING CLAUDIUS	Why, now you speak
4478	Like a good child and a true gentleman.
4479	That I am guiltless of your father's death,
4480	And am most sensible in grief for it,
4481	It shall as level to your judgment pierce
4482	As day does to your eye.
4483	
4484	Danes	[Within]                Let her come in.
4485	
4486	LAERTES	How now! what noise is that?
4487	
4488	[Re-enter OPHELIA]
4489	
4490	O heat, dry up my brains! tears seven times salt,
4491	Burn out the sense and virtue of mine eye!
4492	By heaven, thy madness shall be paid by weight,
4493	Till our scale turn the beam. O rose of May!
4494	Dear maid, kind sister, sweet Ophelia!
4495	O heavens! is't possible, a young maid's wits
4496	Should be as moral as an old man's life?
4497	Nature is fine in love, and where 'tis fine,
4498	It sends some precious instance of itself
4499	After the thing it loves.
4500	
4501	OPHELIA	[Sings]
4502	
4503	They bore him barefaced on the bier;
4504	Hey non nonny, nonny, hey nonny;
4505	And in his grave rain'd many a tear:--
4506	Fare you well, my dove!
4507	
4508	LAERTES	Hadst thou thy wits, and didst persuade revenge,
4509	It could not move thus.
4510	
4511	OPHELIA	[Sings]
4512	
4513	You must sing a-down a-down,
4514	An you call him a-down-a.
4515	O, how the wheel becomes it! It is the false
4516	steward, that stole his master's daughter.
4517	
4518	LAERTES	This nothing's more than matter.
4519	
4520	OPHELIA	There's rosemary, that's for remembrance; pray,
4521	love, remember: and there is pansies. that's for thoughts.
4522	
4523	LAERTES	A document in madness, thoughts and remembrance fitted.
4524	
4525	OPHELIA	There's fennel for you, and columbines: there's rue
4526	for you; and here's some for me: we may call it
4527	herb-grace o' Sundays: O you must wear your rue with
4528	a difference. There's a daisy: I would give you
4529	some violets, but they withered all when my father
4530	died: they say he made a good end,--
4531	
4532	[Sings]
4533	
4534	For bonny sweet Robin is all my joy.
4535	
4536	LAERTES	Thought and affliction, passion, hell itself,
4537	She turns to favour and to prettiness.
4538	
4539	OPHELIA	[Sings]
4540	
4541	And will he not come again?
4542	And will he not come again?
4543	No, no, he is dead:
4544	Go to thy death-bed:
4545	He never will come again.
4546	
4547	His beard was as white as snow,
4548	All flaxen was his poll:
4549	He is gone, he is gone,
4550	And we cast away moan:
4551	God ha' mercy on his soul!
4552	
4553	And of all Christian souls, I pray God. God be wi' ye.
4554	
4555	[Exit]
4556	
4557	LAERTES	Do you see this, O God?
4558	
4559	KING CLAUDIUS	Laertes, I must commune with your grief,
4560	Or you deny me right. Go but apart,
4561	Make choice of whom your wisest friends you will.
4562	And they shall hear and judge 'twixt you and me:
4563	If by direct or by collateral hand
4564	They find us touch'd, we will our kingdom give,
4565	Our crown, our life, and all that we can ours,
4566	To you in satisfaction; but if not,
4567	Be you content to lend your patience to us,
4568	And we shall jointly labour with your soul
4569	To give it due content.
4570	
4571	LAERTES	Let this be so;
4572	His means of death, his obscure funeral--
4573	No trophy, sword, nor hatchment o'er his bones,
4574	No noble rite nor formal ostentation--
4575	Cry to be heard, as 'twere from heaven to earth,
4576	That I must call't in question.
4577	
4578	KING CLAUDIUS	So you shall;
4579	And where the offence is let the great axe fall.
4580	I pray you, go with me.

4616	First Sailor	He shall, sir, an't please him. There's a letter for
4617	you, sir; it comes from the ambassador that was
4618	bound for England; if your name be Horatio, as I am
4619	let to know it is.
4620	
4621	HORATIO	[Reads]  'Horatio, when thou shalt have overlooked
4622	this, give these fellows some means to the king:
4623	they have letters for him. Ere we were two days old
4624	at sea, a pirate of very warlike appointment gave us
4625	chase. Finding ourselves too slow of sail, we put on
4626	a compelled valour, and in the grapple I boarded
4627	them: on the instant they got clear of our ship; so
4628	I alone became their prisoner. They have dealt with
4629	me like thieves of mercy: but they knew what they
4630	did; I am to do a good turn for them. Let the king
4631	have the letters I have sent; and repair thou to me
4632	with as much speed as thou wouldst fly death. I
4633	have words to speak in thine ear will make thee
4634	dumb; yet are they much too light for the bore of
4635	the matter. These good fellows will bring thee
4636	where I am. Rosencrantz and Guildenstern hold their
4637	course for England: of them I have much to tell
4638	thee. Farewell.
4639	'He that thou knowest thine, HAMLET.'
4640	Come, I will make you way for these your letters;
4641	And do't the speedier, that you may direct me

4655	SCENE VII	Another room in the castle.
4656	
4657	
4658	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS and LAERTES]
4659	
4660	KING CLAUDIUS	Now must your conscience my acquaintance seal,
4661	And you must put me in your heart for friend,
4662	Sith you have heard, and with a knowing ear,
4663	That he which hath your noble father slain
4664	Pursued my life.
4665	
4666	LAERTES	                  It well appears: but tell me
4667	Why you proceeded not against these feats,
4668	So crimeful and so capital in nature,
4669	As by your safety, wisdom, all things else,
4670	You mainly were stirr'd up.
4671	
4672	KING CLAUDIUS	O, for two special reasons;
4673	Which may to you, perhaps, seem much unsinew'd,
4674	But yet to me they are strong. The queen his mother
4675	Lives almost by his looks; and for myself--
4676	My virtue or my plague, be it either which--
4677	She's so conjunctive to my life and soul,
4678	That, as the star moves not but in his sphere,
4679	I could not but by her. The other motive,
4680	Why to a public count I might not go,
4681	Is the great love the general gender bear him;
4682	Who, dipping all his faults in their affection,
4683	Would, like the spring that turneth wood to stone,
4684	Convert his gyves to graces; so that my arrows,
4685	Too slightly timber'd for so loud a wind,
4686	Would have reverted to my bow again,
4687	And not where I had aim'd them.
4688	
4689	LAERTES	And so have I a noble father lost;
4690	A sister driven into desperate terms,
4691	Whose worth, if praises may go back again,
4692	Stood challenger on mount of all the age
4693	For her perfections: but my revenge will come.
4694	
4695	KING CLAUDIUS	Break not your sleeps for that: you must not think
4696	That we are made of stuff so flat and dull
4697	That we can let our beard be shook with danger
4698	And think it pastime. You shortly shall hear more:
4699	I loved your father, and we love ourself;
4700	And that, I hope, will teach you to imagine--
4701

4708	
4709	KING CLAUDIUS	From Hamlet! who brought them?
4710	
4711	Messenger	Sailors, my lord, they say; I saw them not:
4712	They were given me by Claudio; he received them
4713	Of him that brought them.

4724	pardon thereunto, recount the occasion of my sudden
4725	and more strange return.                  'HAMLET.'
4726	What should this mean? Are all the rest come back?
4727	Or is it some abuse, and no such thing?
4728	
4729	LAERTES	Know you the hand?
4730	
4731	KING CLAUDIUS	'Tis Hamlets character. 'Naked!
4732	And in a postscript here, he says 'alone.'
4733	Can you advise me?
4734	
4735	LAERTES	I'm lost in it, my lord. But let him come;
4736	It warms the very sickness in my heart,
4737	That I shall live and tell him to his teeth,
4738	'Thus didest thou.'
4739	
4740	KING CLAUDIUS	If it be so, Laertes--
4741	As how should it be so? how otherwise?--
4742	Will you be ruled by me?
4743	
4744	LAERTES	Ay, my lord;
4745	So you will not o'errule me to a peace.
4746	
4747	KING CLAUDIUS	To thine own peace. If he be now return'd,
4748	As checking at his voyage, and that he means
4749	No more to undertake it, I will work him
4750	To an exploit, now ripe in my device,
4751	Under the which he shall not choose but fall:
4752	And for his death no wind of blame shall breathe,
4753	But even his mother shall uncharge the practise
4754	And call it accident.
4755	
4756	LAERTES	My lord, I will be ruled;
4757	The rather, if you could devise it so
4758	That I might be the organ.
4759	
4760	KING CLAUDIUS	It falls right.
4761	You have been talk'd of since your travel much,
4762	And that in Hamlet's hearing, for a quality
4763	Wherein, they say, you shine: your sum of parts
4764	Did not together pluck such envy from him
4765	As did that one, and that, in my regard,
4766	Of the unworthiest siege.
4767	
4768	LAERTES	What part is that, my lord?
4769	
4770	KING CLAUDIUS	A very riband in the cap of youth,
4771	Yet needful too; for youth no less becomes
4772	The light and careless livery that it wears
4773	Than settled age his sables and his weeds,
4774	Importing health and graveness. Two months since,
4775	Here was a gentleman of Normandy:--
4776	I've seen myself, and served against, the French,
4777	And they can well on horseback: but this gallant
4778	Had witchcraft in't; he grew unto his seat;
4779	And to such wondrous doing brought his horse,
4780	As he had been incorpsed and demi-natured
4781	With the brave beast: so far he topp'd my thought,
4782	That I, in forgery of shapes and tricks,
4783	Come short of what he did.
4784	
4785	LAERTES	A Norman was't?
4786	
4787	KING CLAUDIUS	A Norman.
4788	
4789	LAERTES	Upon my life, Lamond.
4790	
4791	KING CLAUDIUS	The very same.
4792	
4793	LAERTES	I know him well: he is the brooch indeed
4794	And gem of all the nation.
4795	
4796	KING CLAUDIUS	He made confession of you,
4797	And gave you such a masterly report
4798	For art and exercise in your defence
4799	And for your rapier most especially,
4800	That he cried out, 'twould be a sight indeed,
4801	If one could match you: the scrimers of their nation,
4802	He swore, had had neither motion, guard, nor eye,
4803	If you opposed them. Sir, this report of his
4804	Did Hamlet so envenom with his envy
4805	That he could nothing do but wish and beg
4806	Your sudden coming o'er, to play with him.
4807	Now, out of this,--
4808	
4809	LAERTES	What out of this, my lord?
4810	
4811	KING CLAUDIUS	Laertes, was your father dear to you?
4812	Or are you like the painting of a sorrow,
4813	A face without a heart?
4814	
4815	LAERTES	Why ask you this?
4816	
4817	KING CLAUDIUS	Not that I think you did not love your father;
4818	But that I know love is begun by time;
4819	And that I see, in passages of proof,
4820	Time qualifies the spark and fire of it.
4821	There lives within the very flame of love
4822	A kind of wick or snuff that will abate it;
4823	And nothing is at a like goodness still;
4824	For goodness, growing to a plurisy,
4825	Dies in his own too much: that we would do
4826	We should do when we would; for this 'would' changes
4827	And hath abatements and delays as many
4828	As there are tongues, are hands, are accidents;
4829	And then this 'should' is like a spendthrift sigh,
4830	That hurts by easing. But, to the quick o' the ulcer:--
4831	Hamlet comes back: what would you undertake,
4832	To show yourself your father's son in deed
4833	More than in words?
4834	
4835	LAERTES	To cut his throat i' the church.
4836	
4837	KING CLAUDIUS	No place, indeed, should murder sanctuarize;
4838	Revenge should have no bounds. But, good Laertes,
4839	Will you do this, keep close within your chamber.
4840	Hamlet return'd shall know you are come home:
4841	We'll put on those shall praise your excellence
4842	And set a double varnish on the fame
4843	The Frenchman gave you, bring you in fine together
4844	And wager on your heads: he, being remiss,
4845	Most generous and free from all contriving,
4846	Will not peruse the foils; so that, with ease,
4847	Or with a little shuffling, you may choose
4848	A sword unbated, and in a pass of practise
4849	Requite him for your father.
4850	
4851	LAERTES	I will do't:
4852	And, for that purpose, I'll anoint my sword.
4853	I bought an unction of a mountebank,
4854	So mortal that, but dip a knife in it,
4855	Where it draws blood no cataplasm so rare,
4856	Collected from all simples that have virtue
4857	Under the moon, can save the thing from death
4858	That is but scratch'd withal: I'll touch my point
4859	With this contagion, that, if I gall him slightly,
4860	It may be death.
4861	
4862	KING CLAUDIUS	                  Let's further think of this;
4863	Weigh what convenience both of time and means
4864	May fit us to our shape: if this should fail,
4865	And that our drift look through our bad performance,
4866	'Twere better not assay'd: therefore this project
4867	Should have a back or second, that might hold,
4868	If this should blast in proof. Soft! let me see:
4869	We'll make a solemn wager on your cunnings: I ha't.
4870	When in your motion you are hot and dry--
4871	As make your bouts more violent to that end--
4872	And that he calls for drink, I'll have prepared him
4873	A chalice for the nonce, whereon but sipping,
4874	If he by chance escape your venom'd stuck,
4875	Our purpose may hold there.
4876	
4877	[Enter QUEEN GERTRUDE]
4878	
4879	How now, sweet queen!
4880	
4881	QUEEN GERTRUDE	One woe doth tread upon another's heel,
4882	So fast they follow; your sister's drown'd, Laertes.
4883	
4884	LAERTES	Drown'd! O, where?
4885	
4886	QUEEN GERTRUDE	There is a willow grows aslant a brook,
4887	That shows his hoar leaves in the glassy stream;
4888	There with fantastic garlands did she come
4889	Of crow-flowers, nettles, daisies, and long purples
4890	That liberal shepherds give a grosser name,
4891	But our cold maids do dead men's fingers call them:
4892	There, on the pendent boughs her coronet weeds
4893	Clambering to hang, an envious sliver broke;
4894	When down her weedy trophies and herself
4895	Fell in the weeping brook. Her clothes spread wide;
4896	And, mermaid-like, awhile they bore her up:
4897	Which time she chanted snatches of old tunes;
4898	As one incapable of her own distress,
4899	Or like a creature native and indued
4900	Unto that element: but long it could not be
4901	Till that her garments, heavy with their drink,
4902	Pull'd the poor wretch from her melodious lay
4903	To muddy death.
4904	
4905	LAERTES	                  Alas, then, she is drown'd?
4906	
4907	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Drown'd, drown'd.
4908	
4909	LAERTES	Too much of water hast thou, poor Ophelia,
4910	And therefore I forbid my tears: but yet
4911	It is our trick; nature her custom holds,
4912	Let shame say what it will: when these are gone,
4913	The woman will be out. Adieu, my lord:
4914	I have a speech of fire, that fain would blaze,
4915	But that this folly douts it.
4916	
4917	[Exit]
4918	
4919	KING CLAUDIUS	Let's follow, Gertrude:
4920	How much I had to do to calm his rage!
4921	Now fear I this will give it start again;
4922	Therefore let's follow.
4923	
4924	[Exeunt]
4925	
4926

4929	HAMLET
4930	
4931	
4932	ACT V
4933	
4934	
4935	
4936	SCENE I	A churchyard.
4937	
4938	
4939	[Enter two Clowns, with spades, &c]
4940	
4941	First Clown	Is she to be buried in Christian burial that
4942	wilfully seeks her own salvation?
4943	
4944	Second Clown	I tell thee she is: and therefore make her grave
4945	straight: the crowner hath sat on her, and finds it
4946	Christian burial.
4947	
4948	First Clown	How can that be, unless she drowned herself in her
4949	own defence?
4950	
4951	Second Clown	Why, 'tis found so.
4952	
4953	First Clown	It must be 'se offendendo;' it cannot be else. For
4954	here lies the point:  if I drown myself wittingly,
4955	it argues an act: and an act hath three branches: it
4956	is, to act, to do, to perform: argal, she drowned
4957	herself wittingly.
4958	
4959	Second Clown	Nay, but hear you, goodman delver,--
4960	
4961	First Clown	Give me leave. Here lies the water; good: here
4962	stands the man; good; if the man go to this water,
4963	and drown himself, it is, will he, nill he, he
4964	goes,--mark you that; but if the water come to him
4965	and drown him, he drowns not himself: argal, he
4966	that is not guilty of his own death shortens not his own life.
4967	
4968	Second Clown	But is this law?
4969	
4970	First Clown	Ay, marry, is't; crowner's quest law.
4971	
4972	Second Clown	Will you ha' the truth on't? If this had not been
4973	a gentlewoman, she should have been buried out o'
4974	Christian burial.
4975	
4976	First Clown	Why, there thou say'st: and the more pity that
4977	great folk should have countenance in this world to
4978	drown or hang themselves, more than their even
4979	Christian. Come, my spade. There is no ancient
4980	gentleman but gardeners, ditchers, and grave-makers:
4981	they hold up Adam's profession.
4982	
4983	Second Clown	Was he a gentleman?
4984	
4985	First Clown	He was the first that ever bore arms.
4986	
4987	Second Clown	Why, he had none.
4988	
4989	First Clown	What, art a heathen? How dost thou understand the
4990	Scripture? The Scripture says 'Adam digged:'
4991	could he dig without arms? I'll put another
4992	question to thee: if thou answerest me not to the
4993	purpose, confess thyself--
4994	
4995	Second Clown	Go to.
4996	
4997	First Clown	What is he that builds stronger than either the
4998	mason, the shipwright, or the carpenter?
4999	
5000	Second Clown	The gallows-maker; for that frame outlives a
5001	thousand tenants.
5002	
5003	First Clown	I like thy wit well, in good faith: the gallows
5004	does well; but how does it well? it does well to
5005	those that do in: now thou dost ill to say the
5006	gallows is built stronger than the church: argal,
5007	the gallows may do well to thee. To't again, come.
5008	
5009	Second Clown	'Who builds stronger than a mason, a shipwright, or
5010	a carpenter?'
5011	
5012	First Clown	Ay, tell me that, and unyoke.
5013	
5014	Second Clown	Marry, now I can tell.
5015	
5016	First Clown	To't.
5017	
5018	Second Clown	Mass, I cannot tell.
5019	
5020	[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO, at a distance]
5021	
5022	First Clown	Cudgel thy brains no more about it, for your dull
5023	ass will not mend his pace with beating; and, when
5024	you are asked this question next, say 'a
5025	grave-maker: 'the houses that he makes last till
5026	doomsday. Go, get thee to Yaughan: fetch me a
5027	stoup of liquor.
5028	
5029	[Exit Second Clown]
5030	
5031	[He digs and sings]
5032	
5033	In youth, when I did love, did love,
5034	Methought it was very sweet,
5035	To contract, O, the time, for, ah, my behove,
5036	O, methought, there was nothing meet.
5037	
5038	HAMLET	Has this fellow no feeling of his business, that he
5039	sings at grave-making?
5040	
5041	HORATIO	Custom hath made it in him a property of easiness.
5042	
5043	HAMLET	'Tis e'en so: the hand of little employment hath
5044	the daintier sense.
5045	
5046	First Clown	[Sings]
5047	
5048	But age, with his stealing steps,
5049	Hath claw'd me in his clutch,
5050	And hath shipped me intil the land,
5051	As if I had never been such.
5052	
5053	[Throws up a skull]
5054	
5055	HAMLET	That skull had a tongue in it, and could sing once:
5056	how the knave jowls it to the ground, as if it were
5057	Cain's jaw-bone, that did the first murder! It
5058	might be the pate of a politician, which this ass
5059	now o'er-reaches; one that would circumvent God,
5060	might it not?
5061	
5062	HORATIO	It might, my lord.
5063	
5064	HAMLET	Or of a courtier; which could say 'Good morrow,
5065	sweet lord! How dost thou, good lord?' This might
5066	be my lord such-a-one, that praised my lord
5067	such-a-one's horse, when he meant to beg it; might it not?
5068	
5069	HORATIO	Ay, my lord.
5070	
5071	HAMLET	Why, e'en so: and now my Lady Worm's; chapless, and
5072	knocked about the mazzard with a sexton's spade:
5073	here's fine revolution, an we had the trick to
5074	see't. Did these bones cost no more the breeding,
5075	but to play at loggats with 'em? mine ache to think on't.
5076	
5077	First Clown: [Sings]
5078	
5079	A pick-axe, and a spade, a spade,
5080	For and a shrouding sheet:
5081	O, a pit of clay for to be made
5082	For such a guest is meet.
5083	
5084	[Throws up another skull]
5085	
5086	HAMLET	There's another: why may not that be the skull of a
5087	lawyer? Where be his quiddities now, his quillets,
5088	his cases, his tenures, and his tricks? why does he
5089	suffer this rude knave now to knock him about the
5090	sconce with a dirty shovel, and will not tell him of
5091	his action of battery? Hum! This fellow might be
5092	in's time a great buyer of land, with his statutes,
5093	his recognizances, his fines, his double vouchers,
5094	his recoveries: is this the fine of his fines, and
5095	the recovery of his recoveries, to have his fine
5096	pate full of fine dirt? will his vouchers vouch him
5097	no more of his purchases, and double ones too, than
5098	the length and breadth of a pair of indentures? The
5099	very conveyances of his lands will hardly lie in
5100	this box; and must the inheritor himself have no more, ha?
5101	
5102	HORATIO	Not a jot more, my lord.
5103	
5104	HAMLET	Is not parchment made of sheepskins?
5105	
5106	HORATIO	Ay, my lord, and of calf-skins too.
5107	
5108	HAMLET	They are sheep and calves which seek out assurance
5109	in that. I will speak to this fellow. Whose
5110	grave's this, sirrah?
5111	
5112	First Clown	Mine, sir.
5113	
5114	[Sings]
5115	
5116	O, a pit of clay for to be made
5117	For such a guest is meet.
5118	
5119	HAMLET	I think it be thine, indeed; for thou liest in't.
5120	
5121	First Clown	You lie out on't, sir, and therefore it is not
5122	yours: for my part, I do not lie in't, and yet it is mine.
5123	
5124	HAMLET	'Thou dost lie in't, to be in't and say it is thine:
5125	'tis for the dead, not for the quick; therefore thou liest.
5126	
5127	First Clown	'Tis a quick lie, sir; 'twill away gain, from me to
5128	you.
5129	
5130	HAMLET	What man dost thou dig it for?
5131	
5132	First Clown	For no man, sir.
5133	
5134	HAMLET	What woman, then?
5135	
5136	First Clown	For none, neither.
5137	
5138	HAMLET	Who is to be buried in't?
5139	
5140	First Clown	One that was a woman, sir; but, rest her soul, she's dead.
5141	
5142	HAMLET	How absolute the knave is! we must speak by the
5143	card, or equivocation will undo us. By the Lord,
5144	Horatio, these three years I have taken a note of
5145	it; the age is grown so picked that the toe of the
5146	peasant comes so near the heel of the courtier, he
5147	gaffs his kibe. How long hast thou been a
5148	grave-maker?
5149	
5150	First Clown	Of all the days i' the year, I came to't that day
5151	that our last king Hamlet overcame Fortinbras.
5152	
5153	HAMLET	How long is that since?
5154	
5155	First Clown	Cannot you tell that? every fool can tell that: it
5156	was the very day that young Hamlet was born; he that
5157	is mad, and sent into England.
5158	
5159	HAMLET	Ay, marry, why was he sent into England?
5160	
5161	First Clown	Why, because he was mad: he shall recover his wits
5162	there; or, if he do not, it's no great matter there.
5163	
5164	HAMLET	Why?
5165	
5166	First Clown	'Twill, a not be seen in him there; there the men
5167	are as mad as he.
5168	
5169	HAMLET	How came he mad?
5170	
5171	First Clown	Very strangely, they say.
5172	
5173	HAMLET	How strangely?
5174	
5175	First Clown	Faith, e'en with losing his wits.
5176	
5177	HAMLET	Upon what ground?
5178	
5179	First Clown	Why, here in Denmark: I have been sexton here, man
5180	and boy, thirty years.
5181	
5182	HAMLET	How long will a man lie i' the earth ere he rot?
5183	
5184	First Clown	I' faith, if he be not rotten before he die--as we
5185	have many pocky corses now-a-days, that will scarce
5186	hold the laying in--he will last you some eight year
5187	or nine year: a tanner will last you nine year.
5188	
5189	HAMLET	Why he more than another?
5190	
5191	First Clown	Why, sir, his hide is so tanned with his trade, that
5192	he will keep out water a great while; and your water
5193	is a sore decayer of your whoreson dead body.
5194	Here's a skull now; this skull has lain in the earth
5195	three and twenty years.
5196	
5197	HAMLET	Whose was it?
5198	
5199	First Clown	A whoreson mad fellow's it was: whose do you think it was?
5200	
5201	HAMLET	Nay, I know not.
5202	
5203	First Clown	A pestilence on him for a mad rogue! a' poured a
5204	flagon of Rhenish on my head once. This same skull,
5205	sir, was Yorick's skull, the king's jester.
5206	
5207	HAMLET	This?
5208	
5209	First Clown	E'en that.
5210	
5211	HAMLET	Let me see.
5212	
5213	[Takes the skull]
5214	
5215	Alas, poor Yorick! I knew him, Horatio: a fellow
5216	of infinite jest, of most excellent fancy: he hath
5217	borne me on his back a thousand times; and now, how
5218	abhorred in my imagination it is! my gorge rims at
5219	it. Here hung those lips that I have kissed I know
5220	not how oft. Where be your gibes now? your
5221	gambols? your songs? your flashes of merriment,
5222	that were wont to set the table on a roar? Not one
5223	now, to mock your own grinning? quite chap-fallen?
5224	Now get you to my lady's chamber, and tell her, let
5225	her paint an inch thick, to this favour she must
5226	come; make her laugh at that. Prithee, Horatio, tell
5227	me one thing.
5228	
5229	HORATIO	What's that, my lord?
5230	
5231	HAMLET	Dost thou think Alexander looked o' this fashion i'
5232	the earth?
5233	
5234	HORATIO	E'en so.
5235	
5236	HAMLET	And smelt so? pah!
5237	
5238	[Puts down the skull]
5239	
5240	HORATIO	E'en so, my lord.
5241	
5242	HAMLET	To what base uses we may return, Horatio! Why may
5243	not imagination trace the noble dust of Alexander,
5244	till he find it stopping a bung-hole?
5245	
5246	HORATIO	'Twere to consider too curiously, to consider so.
5247	
5248	HAMLET	No, faith, not a jot; but to follow him thither with
5249	modesty enough, and likelihood to lead it: as
5250	thus: Alexander died, Alexander was buried,
5251	Alexander returneth into dust; the dust is earth; of
5252	earth we make loam; and why of that loam, whereto he
5253	was converted, might they not stop a beer-barrel?
5254	Imperious Caesar, dead and turn'd to clay,
5255	Might stop a hole to keep the wind away:
5256	O, that that earth, which kept the world in awe,
5257	Should patch a wall to expel the winter flaw!
5258	But soft! but soft! aside: here comes the king.
5259	
5260	[Enter Priest, &c. in procession; the Corpse of
5261	OPHELIA, LAERTES and Mourners following; KING
5262	CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, their trains, &c]
5263	
5264	The queen, the courtiers: who is this they follow?
5265	And with such maimed rites? This doth betoken
5266	The corse they follow did with desperate hand
5267	Fordo its own life: 'twas of some estate.
5268	Couch we awhile, and mark.
5269	
5270	[Retiring with HORATIO]
5271	
5272	LAERTES	What ceremony else?
5273	
5274	HAMLET	That is Laertes,
5275	A very noble youth: mark.
5276	
5277	LAERTES	What ceremony else?
5278	
5279	First Priest	Her obsequies have been as far enlarged
5280	As we have warrantise: her death was doubtful;
5281	And, but that great command o'ersways the order,
5282	She should in ground unsanctified have lodged
5283	Till the last trumpet: for charitable prayers,
5284	Shards, flints and pebbles should be thrown on her;
5285	Yet here she is allow'd her virgin crants,
5286	Her maiden strewments and the bringing home
5287	Of bell and burial.
5288	
5289	LAERTES	Must there no more be done?
5290	
5291	First Priest	No more be done:
5292	We should profane the service of the dead
5293	To sing a requiem and such rest to her
5294	As to peace-parted souls.
5295	
5296	LAERTES	Lay her i' the earth:
5297	And from her fair and unpolluted flesh
5298	May violets spring! I tell thee, churlish priest,
5299	A ministering angel shall my sister be,
5300	When thou liest howling.
5301	
5302	HAMLET	What, the fair Ophelia!
5303	
5304	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Sweets to the sweet: farewell!
5305	
5306	[Scattering flowers]
5307	
5308	I hoped thou shouldst have been my Hamlet's wife;
5309	I thought thy bride-bed to have deck'd, sweet maid,
5310	And not have strew'd thy grave.
5311	
5312	LAERTES	O, treble woe
5313	Fall ten times treble on that cursed head,
5314	Whose wicked deed thy most ingenious sense
5315	Deprived thee of! Hold off the earth awhile,
5316	Till I have caught her once more in mine arms:
5317	
5318	[Leaps into the grave]
5319	
5320	Now pile your dust upon the quick and dead,
5321	Till of this flat a mountain you have made,
5322	To o'ertop old Pelion, or the skyish head
5323	Of blue Olympus.
5324	
5325	HAMLET	[Advancing]     What is he whose grief
5326	Bears such an emphasis? whose phrase of sorrow
5327	Conjures the wandering stars, and makes them stand
5328	Like wonder-wounded hearers? This is I,
5329	Hamlet the Dane.
5330	
5331	[Leaps into the grave]
5332	
5333	LAERTES	                  The devil take thy soul!
5334	
5335	[Grappling with him]
5336	
5337	HAMLET	Thou pray'st not well.
5338	I prithee, take thy fingers from my throat;
5339	For, though I am not splenitive and rash,
5340	Yet have I something in me dangerous,
5341	Which let thy wiseness fear: hold off thy hand.
5342	
5343	KING CLAUDIUS	Pluck them asunder.
5344	
5345	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Hamlet, Hamlet!
5346	
5347	All	Gentlemen,--
5348	
5349	HORATIO	                  Good my lord, be quiet.
5350	
5351	[The Attendants part them, and they come out of the grave]
5352	
5353	HAMLET	Why I will fight with him upon this theme
5354	Until my eyelids will no longer wag.
5355	
5356	QUEEN GERTRUDE	O my son, what theme?
5357	
5358	HAMLET	I loved Ophelia: forty thousand brothers
5359	Could not, with all their quantity of love,
5360	Make up my sum. What wilt thou do for her?
5361	
5362	KING CLAUDIUS	O, he is mad, Laertes.
5363	
5364	QUEEN GERTRUDE	For love of God, forbear him.
5365	
5366	HAMLET	'Swounds, show me what thou'lt do:
5367	Woo't weep? woo't fight? woo't fast? woo't tear thyself?
5368	Woo't drink up eisel? eat a crocodile?
5369	I'll do't. Dost thou come here to whine?
5370	To outface me with leaping in her grave?
5371	Be buried quick with her, and so will I:
5372	And, if thou prate of mountains, let them throw
5373	Millions of acres on us, till our ground,
5374	Singeing his pate against the burning zone,
5375	Make Ossa like a wart! Nay, an thou'lt mouth,
5376	I'll rant as well as thou.
5377	
5378	QUEEN GERTRUDE	This is mere madness:
5379	And thus awhile the fit will work on him;
5380	Anon, as patient as the female dove,
5381	When that her golden couplets are disclosed,
5382	His silence will sit drooping.
5383	
5384	HAMLET	Hear you, sir;
5385	What is the reason that you use me thus?
5386	I loved you ever: but it is no matter;
5387	Let Hercules himself do what he may,
5388	The cat will mew and dog will have his day.
5389	
5390	[Exit]
5391	
5392	KING CLAUDIUS	I pray you, good Horatio, wait upon him.
5393	
5394	[Exit HORATIO]
5395	
5396	[To LAERTES]
5397	
5398	Strengthen your patience in our last night's speech;
5399	We'll put the matter to the present push.
5400	Good Gertrude, set some watch over your son.
5401	This grave shall have a living monument:
5402	An hour of quiet shortly shall we see;
5403	Till then, in patience our proceeding be.
5404	
5405	[Exeunt]
5406	
5407	
5408	
5409	HAMLET
5410	
5411	
5412	ACT V
5413	
5414	
5415	
5416	SCENE II	A hall in the castle.
5417	
5418	
5419	[Enter HAMLET and HORATIO]
5420	
5421	HAMLET	So much for this, sir: now shall you see the other;
5422	You do remember all the circumstance?
5423	
5424	HORATIO	Remember it, my lord?
5425	
5426	HAMLET	Sir, in my heart there was a kind of fighting,
5427	That would not let me sleep: methought I lay
5428	Worse than the mutines in the bilboes. Rashly,
5429	And praised be rashness for it, let us know,
5430	Our indiscretion sometimes serves us well,
5431	When our deep plots do pall: and that should teach us
5432	There's a divinity that shapes our ends,
5433	Rough-hew them how we will,--
5434	
5435	HORATIO	That is most certain.
5436	
5437	HAMLET	Up from my cabin,
5438	My sea-gown scarf'd about me, in the dark
5439	Groped I to find out them; had my desire.
5440	Finger'd their packet, and in fine withdrew
5441	To mine own room again; making so bold,
5442	My fears forgetting manners, to unseal
5443	Their grand commission; where I found, Horatio,--
5444	O royal knavery!--an exact command,
5445	Larded with many several sorts of reasons
5446	Importing Denmark's health and England's too,
5447	With, ho! such bugs and goblins in my life,
5448	That, on the supervise, no leisure bated,
5449	No, not to stay the grinding of the axe,
5450	My head should be struck off.
5451	
5452	HORATIO	Is't possible?
5453	
5454	HAMLET	Here's the commission: read it at more leisure.
5455	But wilt thou hear me how I did proceed?
5456	
5457	HORATIO	I beseech you.
5458	
5459	HAMLET	Being thus be-netted round with villanies,--
5460	Ere I could make a prologue to my brains,
5461	They had begun the play--I sat me down,
5462	Devised a new commission, wrote it fair:
5463	I once did hold it, as our statists do,
5464	A baseness to write fair and labour'd much
5465	How to forget that learning, but, sir, now
5466	It did me yeoman's service: wilt thou know
5467	The effect of what I wrote?
5468	
5469	HORATIO	Ay, good my lord.
5470	
5471	HAMLET	An earnest conjuration from the king,
5472	As England was his faithful tributary,
5473	As love between them like the palm might flourish,
5474	As peace should stiff her wheaten garland wear
5475	And stand a comma 'tween their amities,
5476	And many such-like 'As'es of great charge,
5477	That, on the view and knowing of these contents,
5478	Without debatement further, more or less,
5479	He should the bearers put to sudden death,
5480	Not shriving-time allow'd.
5481	
5482	HORATIO	How was this seal'd?
5483	
5484	HAMLET	Why, even in that was heaven ordinant.
5485	I had my father's signet in my purse,
5486	Which was the model of that Danish seal;
5487	Folded the writ up in form of the other,
5488	Subscribed it, gave't the impression, placed it safely,
5489	The changeling never known. Now, the next day
5490	Was our sea-fight; and what to this was sequent
5491	Thou know'st already.
5492	
5493	HORATIO	So Guildenstern and Rosencrantz go to't.
5494	
5495	HAMLET	Why, man, they did make love to this employment;
5496	They are not near my conscience; their defeat
5497	Does by their own insinuation grow:
5498	'Tis dangerous when the baser nature comes
5499	Between the pass and fell incensed points
5500	Of mighty opposites.
5501	
5502	HORATIO	Why, what a king is this!
5503	
5504	HAMLET	Does it not, think'st thee, stand me now upon--
5505	He that hath kill'd my king and whored my mother,
5506	Popp'd in between the election and my hopes,
5507	Thrown out his angle for my proper life,
5508	And with such cozenage--is't not perfect conscience,
5509	To quit him with this arm? and is't not to be damn'd,
5510	To let this canker of our nature come
5511	In further evil?
5512	
5513	HORATIO	It must be shortly known to him from England
5514	What is the issue of the business there.
5515	
5516	HAMLET	It will be short: the interim is mine;
5517	And a man's life's no more than to say 'One.'
5518	But I am very sorry, good Horatio,
5519	That to Laertes I forgot myself;
5520	For, by the image of my cause, I see
5521	The portraiture of his: I'll court his favours.
5522	But, sure, the bravery of his grief did put me
5523	Into a towering passion.
5524	
5525	HORATIO	Peace! who comes here?
5526	
5527	[Enter OSRIC]
5528	
5529	OSRIC	Your lordship is right welcome back to Denmark.
5530	
5531	HAMLET	I humbly thank you, sir. Dost know this water-fly?
5532	
5533	HORATIO	No, my good lord.
5534	
5535	HAMLET	Thy state is the more gracious; for 'tis a vice to
5536	know him. He hath much land, and fertile: let a
5537	beast be lord of beasts, and his crib shall stand at
5538	the king's mess: 'tis a chough; but, as I say,
5539	spacious in the possession of dirt.
5540	
5541	OSRIC	Sweet lord, if your lordship were at leisure, I
5542	should impart a thing to you from his majesty.
5543	
5544	HAMLET	I will receive it, sir, with all diligence of
5545	spirit. Put your bonnet to his right use; 'tis for the head.
5546	
5547	OSRIC	I thank your lordship, it is very hot.
5548	
5549	HAMLET	No, believe me, 'tis very cold; the wind is
5550	northerly.
5551	
5552	OSRIC	It is indifferent cold, my lord, indeed.
5553	
5554	HAMLET	But yet methinks it is very sultry and hot for my
5555	complexion.
5556	
5557	OSRIC	Exceedingly, my lord; it is very sultry,--as
5558	'twere,--I cannot tell how. But, my lord, his
5559	majesty bade me signify to you that he has laid a
5560	great wager on your head: sir, this is the matter,--
5561	
5562	HAMLET	I beseech you, remember--
5563	
5564	[HAMLET moves him to put on his hat]
5565	
5566	OSRIC	Nay, good my lord; for mine ease, in good faith.
5567	Sir, here is newly come to court Laertes; believe
5568	me, an absolute gentleman, full of most excellent
5569	differences, of very soft society and great showing:
5570	indeed, to speak feelingly of him, he is the card or
5571	calendar of gentry, for you shall find in him the
5572	continent of what part a gentleman would see.
5573	
5574	HAMLET	Sir, his definement suffers no perdition in you;
5575	though, I know, to divide him inventorially would
5576	dizzy the arithmetic of memory, and yet but yaw
5577	neither, in respect of his quick sail. But, in the
5578	verity of extolment, I take him to be a soul of
5579	great article; and his infusion of such dearth and
5580	rareness, as, to make true diction of him, his
5581	semblable is his mirror; and who else would trace
5582	him, his umbrage, nothing more.
5583	
5584	OSRIC	Your lordship speaks most infallibly of him.
5585	
5586	HAMLET	The concernancy, sir? why do we wrap the gentleman
5587	in our more rawer breath?
5588	
5589	OSRIC	Sir?
5590	
5591	HORATIO	Is't not possible to understand in another tongue?
5592	You will do't, sir, really.
5593	
5594	HAMLET	What imports the nomination of this gentleman?
5595	
5596	OSRIC	Of Laertes?
5597	
5598	HORATIO	His purse is empty already; all's golden words are spent.
5599	
5600	HAMLET	Of him, sir.
5601	
5602	OSRIC	I know you are not ignorant--
5603	
5604	HAMLET	I would you did, sir; yet, in faith, if you did,
5605	it would not much approve me. Well, sir?
5606	
5607	OSRIC	You are not ignorant of what excellence Laertes is--
5608	
5609	HAMLET	I dare not confess that, lest I should compare with
5610	him in excellence; but, to know a man well, were to
5611	know himself.
5612	
5613	OSRIC	I mean, sir, for his weapon; but in the imputation
5614	laid on him by them, in his meed he's unfellowed.
5615	
5616	HAMLET	What's his weapon?
5617	
5618	OSRIC	Rapier and dagger.
5619	
5620	HAMLET	That's two of his weapons: but, well.
5621	
5622	OSRIC	The king, sir, hath wagered with him six Barbary
5623	horses: against the which he has imponed, as I take
5624	it, six French rapiers and poniards, with their
5625	assigns, as girdle, hangers, and so: three of the
5626	carriages, in faith, are very dear to fancy, very
5627	responsive to the hilts, most delicate carriages,
5628	and of very liberal conceit.
5629	
5630	HAMLET	What call you the carriages?
5631	
5632	HORATIO	I knew you must be edified by the margent ere you had done.
5633	
5634	OSRIC	The carriages, sir, are the hangers.
5635	
5636	HAMLET	The phrase would be more german to the matter, if we
5637	could carry cannon by our sides: I would it might
5638	be hangers till then. But, on: six Barbary horses
5639	against six French swords, their assigns, and three
5640	liberal-conceited carriages; that's the French bet
5641	against the Danish. Why is this 'imponed,' as you call it?
5642	
5643	OSRIC	The king, sir, hath laid, that in a dozen passes
5644	between yourself and him, he shall not exceed you
5645	three hits: he hath laid on twelve for nine; and it
5646	would come to immediate trial, if your lordship
5647	would vouchsafe the answer.
5648	
5649	HAMLET	How if I answer 'no'?
5650	
5651	OSRIC	I mean, my lord, the opposition of your person in trial.
5652	
5653	HAMLET	Sir, I will walk here in the hall: if it please his
5654	majesty, 'tis the breathing time of day with me; let
5655	the foils be brought, the gentleman willing, and the
5656	king hold his purpose, I will win for him an I can;
5657	if not, I will gain nothing but my shame and the odd hits.
5658	
5659	OSRIC	Shall I re-deliver you e'en so?
5660	
5661	HAMLET	To this effect, sir; after what flourish your nature will.
5662	
5663	OSRIC	I commend my duty to your lordship.
5664	
5665	HAMLET	Yours, yours.
5666	
5667	[Exit OSRIC]
5668	
5669	He does well to commend it himself; there are no
5670	tongues else for's turn.
5671	
5672	HORATIO	This lapwing runs away with the shell on his head.
5673	
5674	HAMLET	He did comply with his dug, before he sucked it.
5675	Thus has he--and many more of the same bevy that I
5676	know the dressy age dotes on--only got the tune of
5677	the time and outward habit of encounter; a kind of
5678	yesty collection, which carries them through and
5679	through the most fond and winnowed opinions; and do
5680	but blow them to their trial, the bubbles are out.
5681	
5682	[Enter a Lord]
5683	
5684	Lord	My lord, his majesty commended him to you by young
5685	Osric, who brings back to him that you attend him in
5686	the hall: he sends to know if your pleasure hold to
5687	play with Laertes, or that you will take longer time.
5688	
5689	HAMLET	I am constant to my purpose; they follow the king's
5690	pleasure: if his fitness speaks, mine is ready; now
5691	or whensoever, provided I be so able as now.
5692	
5693	Lord	The king and queen and all are coming down.
5694	
5695	HAMLET	In happy time.
5696	
5697	Lord	The queen desires you to use some gentle
5698	entertainment to Laertes before you fall to play.
5699	
5700	HAMLET	She well instructs me.
5701	
5702	[Exit Lord]
5703	
5704	HORATIO	You will lose this wager, my lord.
5705	
5706	HAMLET	I do not think so: since he went into France, I
5707	have been in continual practise: I shall win at the
5708	odds. But thou wouldst not think how ill all's here
5709	about my heart: but it is no matter.
5710	
5711	HORATIO	Nay, good my lord,--
5712	
5713	HAMLET	It is but foolery; but it is such a kind of
5714	gain-giving, as would perhaps trouble a woman.
5715	
5716	HORATIO	If your mind dislike any thing, obey it: I will
5717	forestall their repair hither, and say you are not
5718	fit.
5719	
5720	HAMLET	Not a whit, we defy augury: there's a special
5721	providence in the fall of a sparrow. If it be now,
5722	'tis not to come; if it be not to come, it will be
5723	now; if it be not now, yet it will come: the
5724	readiness is all: since no man has aught of what he
5725	leaves, what is't to leave betimes?
5726	
5727	[Enter KING CLAUDIUS, QUEEN GERTRUDE, LAERTES,
5728	Lords, OSRIC, and Attendants with foils, &c]
5729	
5730	KING CLAUDIUS	Come, Hamlet, come, and take this hand from me.
5731	
5732	[KING CLAUDIUS puts LAERTES' hand into HAMLET's]
5733	
5734	HAMLET	Give me your pardon, sir: I've done you wrong;
5735	But pardon't, as you are a gentleman.
5736	This presence knows,
5737	And you must needs have heard, how I am punish'd
5738	With sore distraction. What I have done,
5739	That might your nature, honour and exception
5740	Roughly awake, I here proclaim was madness.
5741	Was't Hamlet wrong'd Laertes? Never Hamlet:
5742	If Hamlet from himself be ta'en away,
5743	And when he's not himself does wrong Laertes,
5744	Then Hamlet does it not, Hamlet denies it.
5745	Who does it, then? His madness: if't be so,
5746	Hamlet is of the faction that is wrong'd;
5747	His madness is poor Hamlet's enemy.
5748	Sir, in this audience,
5749	Let my disclaiming from a purposed evil
5750	Free me so far in your most generous thoughts,
5751	That I have shot mine arrow o'er the house,
5752	And hurt my brother.
5753	
5754	LAERTES	I am satisfied in nature,
5755	Whose motive, in this case, should stir me most
5756	To my revenge: but in my terms of honour
5757	I stand aloof; and will no reconcilement,
5758	Till by some elder masters, of known honour,
5759	I have a voice and precedent of peace,
5760	To keep my name ungored. But till that time,
5761	I do receive your offer'd love like love,
5762	And will not wrong it.
5763	
5764	HAMLET	I embrace it freely;
5765	And will this brother's wager frankly play.
5766	Give us the foils. Come on.
5767	
5768	LAERTES	Come, one for me.
5769	
5770	HAMLET	I'll be your foil, Laertes: in mine ignorance
5771	Your skill shall, like a star i' the darkest night,
5772	Stick fiery off indeed.
5773	
5774	LAERTES	You mock me, sir.
5775	
5776	HAMLET	No, by this hand.
5777	
5778	KING CLAUDIUS	Give them the foils, young Osric. Cousin Hamlet,
5779	You know the wager?
5780	
5781	HAMLET	Very well, my lord
5782	Your grace hath laid the odds o' the weaker side.
5783	
5784	KING CLAUDIUS	I do not fear it; I have seen you both:
5785	But since he is better'd, we have therefore odds.
5786	
5787	LAERTES	This is too heavy, let me see another.
5788	
5789	HAMLET	This likes me well. These foils have all a length?
5790	
5791	[They prepare to play]
5792	
5793	OSRIC	Ay, my good lord.
5794	
5795	KING CLAUDIUS	Set me the stoops of wine upon that table.
5796	If Hamlet give the first or second hit,
5797	Or quit in answer of the third exchange,
5798	Let all the battlements their ordnance fire:
5799	The king shall drink to Hamlet's better breath;
5800	And in the cup an union shall he throw,
5801	Richer than that which four successive kings
5802	In Denmark's crown have worn. Give me the cups;
5803	And let the kettle to the trumpet speak,
5804	The trumpet to the cannoneer without,
5805	The cannons to the heavens, the heavens to earth,
5806	'Now the king dunks to Hamlet.' Come, begin:
5807	And you, the judges, bear a wary eye.
5808	
5809	HAMLET	Come on, sir.
5810	
5811	LAERTES	                  Come, my lord.
5812	
5813	[They play]
5814	
5815	HAMLET	One.
5816	
5817	LAERTES	No.
5818	
5819	HAMLET	Judgment.
5820	
5821	OSRIC	A hit, a very palpable hit.
5822	
5823	LAERTES	Well; again.
5824	
5825	KING CLAUDIUS	Stay; give me drink. Hamlet, this pearl is thine;
5826	Here's to thy health.
5827	
5828	[Trumpets sound, and cannon shot off within]
5829	
5830	Give him the cup.
5831	
5832	HAMLET	I'll play this bout first; set it by awhile. Come.
5833	
5834	[They play]
5835	
5836	Another hit; what say you?
5837	
5838	LAERTES	A touch, a touch, I do confess.
5839	
5840	KING CLAUDIUS	Our son shall win.
5841	
5842	QUEEN GERTRUDE	                  He's fat, and scant of breath.
5843	Here, Hamlet, take my napkin, rub thy brows;
5844	The queen carouses to thy fortune, Hamlet.
5845	
5846	HAMLET	Good madam!
5847	
5848	KING CLAUDIUS	          Gertrude, do not drink.
5849	
5850	QUEEN GERTRUDE	I will, my lord; I pray you, pardon me.
5851	
5852	KING CLAUDIUS	[Aside]  It is the poison'd cup: it is too late.
5853	
5854	HAMLET	I dare not drink yet, madam; by and by.
5855	
5856	QUEEN GERTRUDE	Come, let me wipe thy face.
5857	
5858	LAERTES	My lord, I'll hit him now.
5859	
5860	KING CLAUDIUS	I do not think't.
5861	
5862	LAERTES	[Aside]  And yet 'tis almost 'gainst my conscience.
5863	
5864	HAMLET	Come, for the third, Laertes: you but dally;
5865	I pray you, pass with your best violence;
5866	I am afeard you make a wanton of me.
5867	
5868	LAERTES	Say you so? come on.
5869	
5870	[They play]
5871	
5872	OSRIC	Nothing, neither way.
5873	
5874	LAERTES	Have at you now!
5875	
5876	[LAERTES wounds HAMLET; then in scuffling, they
5877	change rapiers, and HAMLET wounds LAERTES]
5878	
5879	KING CLAUDIUS	Part them; they are incensed.
5880	
5881	HAMLET	Nay, come, again.
5882	
5883	[QUEEN GERTRUDE falls]
5884	
5885	OSRIC	                  Look to the queen there, ho!
5886	
5887	HORATIO	They bleed on both sides. How is it, my lord?
5888	
5889	OSRIC	How is't, Laertes?
5890	
5891	LAERTES	Why, as a woodcock to mine own springe, Osric;
5892	I am justly kill'd with mine own treachery.
5893	
5894	HAMLET	How does the queen?
5895	
5896	KING CLAUDIUS	She swounds to see them bleed.
5897	
5898	QUEEN GERTRUDE	No, no, the drink, the drink,--O my dear Hamlet,--
5899	The drink, the drink! I am poison'd.
5900	
5901	[Dies]
5902	
5903	HAMLET	O villany! Ho! let the door be lock'd:
5904	Treachery! Seek it out.
5905	
5906	LAERTES	It is here, Hamlet: Hamlet, thou art slain;
5907	No medicine in the world can do thee good;
5908	In thee there is not half an hour of life;
5909	The treacherous instrument is in thy hand,
5910	Unbated and envenom'd: the foul practise
5911	Hath turn'd itself on me lo, here I lie,
5912	Never to rise again: thy mother's poison'd:
5913	I can no more: the king, the king's to blame.
5914	
5915	HAMLET	The point!--envenom'd too!
5916	Then, venom, to thy work.
5917	
5918	[Stabs KING CLAUDIUS]
5919	
5920	All	Treason! treason!
5921	
5922	KING CLAUDIUS	O, yet defend me, friends; I am but hurt.
5923	
5924	HAMLET	Here, thou incestuous, murderous, damned Dane,
5925	Drink off this potion. Is thy union here?
5926	Follow my mother.
5927	
5928	[KING CLAUDIUS dies]
5929	
5930	LAERTES	                  He is justly served;
5931	It is a poison temper'd by himself.
5932	Exchange forgiveness with me, noble Hamlet:
5933	Mine and my father's death come not upon thee,
5934	Nor thine on me.
5935	
5936	[Dies]
5937	
5938	HAMLET	Heaven make thee free of it! I follow thee.
5939	I am dead, Horatio. Wretched queen, adieu!
5940	You that look pale and tremble at this chance,
5941	That are but mutes or audience to this act,
5942	Had I but time--as this fell sergeant, death,
5943	Is strict in his arrest--O, I could tell you--
5944	But let it be. Horatio, I am dead;
5945	Thou livest; report me and my cause aright
5946	To the unsatisfied.
5947	
5948	HORATIO	Never believe it:
5949	I am more an antique Roman than a Dane:
5950	Here's yet some liquor left.
5951	
5952	HAMLET	As thou'rt a man,
5953	Give me the cup: let go; by heaven, I'll have't.
5954	O good Horatio, what a wounded name,
5955	Things standing thus unknown, shall live behind me!
5956	If thou didst ever hold me in thy heart
5957	Absent thee from felicity awhile,
5958	And in this harsh world draw thy breath in pain,
5959	To tell my story.
5960	
5961	[March afar off, and shot within]
5962	
5963	What warlike noise is this?
5964	
5965	OSRIC	Young Fortinbras, with conquest come from Poland,
5966	To the ambassadors of England gives
5967	This warlike volley.
5968	
5969	HAMLET	O, I die, Horatio;
5970	The potent poison quite o'er-crows my spirit:
5971	I cannot live to hear the news from England;
5972	But I do prophesy the election lights
5973	On Fortinbras: he has my dying voice;
5974	So tell him, with the occurrents, more and less,
5975	Which have solicited. The rest is silence.
5976	
5977	[Dies]
5978	
5979	HORATIO	Now cracks a noble heart. Good night sweet prince:
5980	And flights of angels sing thee to thy rest!
5981	Why does the drum come hither?
5982	
5983	[March within]
5984	
5985	[Enter FORTINBRAS, the English Ambassadors,
5986	and others]
5987	
5988	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Where is this sight?
5989	
5990	HORATIO	What is it ye would see?
5991	If aught of woe or wonder, cease your search.
5992	
5993	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	This quarry cries on havoc. O proud death,
5994	What feast is toward in thine eternal cell,
5995	That thou so many princes at a shot
5996	So bloodily hast struck?
5997	
5998	First Ambassador	The sight is dismal;
5999	And our affairs from England come too late:
6000	The ears are senseless that should give us hearing,
6001	To tell him his commandment is fulfill'd,
6002	That Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are dead:
6003	Where should we have our thanks?
6004	
6005	HORATIO	Not from his mouth,
6006	Had it the ability of life to thank you:
6007	He never gave commandment for their death.
6008	But since, so jump upon this bloody question,
6009	You from the Polack wars, and you from England,
6010	Are here arrived give order that these bodies
6011	High on a stage be placed to the view;
6012	And let me speak to the yet unknowing world
6013	How these things came about: so shall you hear
6014	Of carnal, bloody, and unnatural acts,
6015	Of accidental judgments, casual slaughters,
6016	Of deaths put on by cunning and forced cause,
6017	And, in this upshot, purposes mistook
6018	Fall'n on the inventors' reads: all this can I
6019	Truly deliver.
6020	
6021	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	                  Let us haste to hear it,
6022	And call the noblest to the audience.
6023	For me, with sorrow I embrace my fortune:
6024	I have some rights of memory in this kingdom,
6025	Which now to claim my vantage doth invite me.
6026	
6027	HORATIO	Of that I shall have also cause to speak,
6028	And from his mouth whose voice will draw on more;
6029	But let this same be presently perform'd,
6030	Even while men's minds are wild; lest more mischance
6031	On plots and errors, happen.
6032	
6033	PRINCE FORTINBRAS	Let four captains
6034	Bear Hamlet, like a soldier, to the stage;
6035	For he was likely, had he been put on,
6036	To have proved most royally: and, for his passage,
6037	The soldiers' music and the rites of war
6038	Speak loudly for him.
6039	Take up the bodies: such a sight as this
6040	Becomes the field, but here shows much amiss.
6041	Go, bid the soldiers shoot.
6042	
6043	[A dead march. Exeunt, bearing off the dead
6044	bodies; after which a peal of ordnance is shot off]

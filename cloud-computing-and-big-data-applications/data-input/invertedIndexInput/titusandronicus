78	ACT I
79	
80	
81	
82	SCENE I	Rome. Before the Capitol.
83	
84	
85	[The Tomb of the ANDRONICI appearing; the Tribunes
86	and Senators aloft. Enter, below, from one side,
87	SATURNINUS and his Followers; and, from the other
88	side, BASSIANUS and his Followers; with drum and colours]
89	
90	SATURNINUS	Noble patricians, patrons of my right,
91	Defend the justice of my cause with arms,
92	And, countrymen, my loving followers,
93	Plead my successive title with your swords:
94	I am his first-born son, that was the last
95	That wore the imperial diadem of Rome;
96	Then let my father's honours live in me,
97	Nor wrong mine age with this indignity.
98	
99	BASSIANUS	Romans, friends, followers, favorers of my right,
100	If ever Bassianus, Caesar's son,
101	Were gracious in the eyes of royal Rome,
102	Keep then this passage to the Capitol
103	And suffer not dishonour to approach
104	The imperial seat, to virtue consecrate,
105	To justice, continence and nobility;
106	But let desert in pure election shine,
107	And, Romans, fight for freedom in your choice.
108	
109	[Enter MARCUS ANDRONICUS, aloft, with the crown]
110	
111	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Princes, that strive by factions and by friends
112	Ambitiously for rule and empery,
113	Know that the people of Rome, for whom we stand
114	A special party, have, by common voice,
115	In election for the Roman empery,
116	Chosen Andronicus, surnamed Pius
117	For many good and great deserts to Rome:
118	A nobler man, a braver warrior,
119	Lives not this day within the city walls:
120	He by the senate is accit'd home
121	From weary wars against the barbarous Goths;
122	That, with his sons, a terror to our foes,
123	Hath yoked a nation strong, train'd up in arms.
124	Ten years are spent since first he undertook
125	This cause of Rome and chastised with arms
126	Our enemies' pride: five times he hath return'd
127	Bleeding to Rome, bearing his valiant sons
128	In coffins from the field;
129	And now at last, laden with horror's spoils,
130	Returns the good Andronicus to Rome,
131	Renowned Titus, flourishing in arms.
132	Let us entreat, by honour of his name,
133	Whom worthily you would have now succeed.
134	And in the Capitol and senate's right,
135	Whom you pretend to honour and adore,
136	That you withdraw you and abate your strength;
137	Dismiss your followers and, as suitors should,
138	Plead your deserts in peace and humbleness.
139	
140	SATURNINUS	How fair the tribune speaks to calm my thoughts!
141	
142	BASSIANUS	Marcus Andronicus, so I do ally
143	In thy uprightness and integrity,
144	And so I love and honour thee and thine,
145	Thy noble brother Titus and his sons,
146	And her to whom my thoughts are humbled all,
147	Gracious Lavinia, Rome's rich ornament,
148	That I will here dismiss my loving friends,
149	And to my fortunes and the people's favor
150	Commit my cause in balance to be weigh'd.
151	
152	[Exeunt the followers of BASSIANUS]
153	
154	SATURNINUS	Friends, that have been thus forward in my right,
155	I thank you all and here dismiss you all,
156	And to the love and favor of my country
157	Commit myself, my person and the cause.
158	
159	[Exeunt the followers of SATURNINUS]
160	
161	Rome, be as just and gracious unto me
162	As I am confident and kind to thee.
163	Open the gates, and let me in.
164	
165	BASSIANUS	Tribunes, and me, a poor competitor.
166	
167	[Flourish. SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS go up into the Capitol]
168	
169	[Enter a Captain]
170	
171	Captain	Romans, make way: the good Andronicus.
172	Patron of virtue, Rome's best champion,
173	Successful in the battles that he fights,
174	With honour and with fortune is return'd
175	From where he circumscribed with his sword,
176	And brought to yoke, the enemies of Rome.
177	
178	[Drums and trumpets sounded. Enter MARTIUS and
179	MUTIUS; After them, two Men bearing a coffin
180	covered with black; then LUCIUS and QUINTUS. After
181	them, TITUS ANDRONICUS; and then TAMORA, with
182	ALARBUS, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON, AARON, and other Goths,
183	prisoners; Soldiers and people following. The
184	Bearers set down the coffin, and TITUS speaks]
185	
186	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Hail, Rome, victorious in thy mourning weeds!
187	Lo, as the bark, that hath discharged her fraught,
188	Returns with precious jading to the bay
189	From whence at first she weigh'd her anchorage,
190	Cometh Andronicus, bound with laurel boughs,
191	To re-salute his country with his tears,
192	Tears of true joy for his return to Rome.
193	Thou great defender of this Capitol,
194	Stand gracious to the rites that we intend!
195	Romans, of five and twenty valiant sons,
196	Half of the number that King Priam had,
197	Behold the poor remains, alive and dead!
198	These that survive let Rome reward with love;
199	These that I bring unto their latest home,
200	With burial amongst their ancestors:
201	Here Goths have given me leave to sheathe my sword.
202	Titus, unkind and careless of thine own,
203	Why suffer'st thou thy sons, unburied yet,
204	To hover on the dreadful shore of Styx?
205	Make way to lay them by their brethren.
206	
207	[The tomb is opened]
208	
209	There greet in silence, as the dead are wont,
210	And sleep in peace, slain in your country's wars!
211	O sacred receptacle of my joys,
212	Sweet cell of virtue and nobility,
213	How many sons of mine hast thou in store,
214	That thou wilt never render to me more!
215	
216	LUCIUS	Give us the proudest prisoner of the Goths,
217	That we may hew his limbs, and on a pile
218	Ad manes fratrum sacrifice his flesh,
219	Before this earthy prison of their bones;
220	That so the shadows be not unappeased,
221	Nor we disturb'd with prodigies on earth.
222	
223	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I give him you, the noblest that survives,
224	The eldest son of this distressed queen.
225	
226	TAMORA	Stay, Roman brethren! Gracious conqueror,
227	Victorious Titus, rue the tears I shed,
228	A mother's tears in passion for her son:
229	And if thy sons were ever dear to thee,
230	O, think my son to be as dear to me!
231	Sufficeth not that we are brought to Rome,
232	To beautify thy triumphs and return,
233	Captive to thee and to thy Roman yoke,
234	But must my sons be slaughter'd in the streets,
235	For valiant doings in their country's cause?
236	O, if to fight for king and commonweal
237	Were piety in thine, it is in these.
238	Andronicus, stain not thy tomb with blood:
239	Wilt thou draw near the nature of the gods?
240	Draw near them then in being merciful:
241	Sweet mercy is nobility's true badge:
242	Thrice noble Titus, spare my first-born son.
243	
244	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Patient yourself, madam, and pardon me.
245	These are their brethren, whom you Goths beheld
246	Alive and dead, and for their brethren slain
247	Religiously they ask a sacrifice:
248	To this your son is mark'd, and die he must,
249	To appease their groaning shadows that are gone.
250	
251	LUCIUS	Away with him! and make a fire straight;
252	And with our swords, upon a pile of wood,
253	Let's hew his limbs till they be clean consumed.
254	
255	[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS, and MUTIUS, with ALARBUS]
256	
257	TAMORA	O cruel, irreligious piety!
258	
259	CHIRON	Was ever Scythia half so barbarous?
260	
261	DEMETRIUS	Oppose not Scythia to ambitious Rome.
262	Alarbus goes to rest; and we survive
263	To tremble under Titus' threatening looks.
264	Then, madam, stand resolved, but hope withal
265	The self-same gods that arm'd the Queen of Troy
266	With opportunity of sharp revenge
267	Upon the Thracian tyrant in his tent,
268	May favor Tamora, the Queen of Goths--
269	When Goths were Goths and Tamora was queen--
270	To quit the bloody wrongs upon her foes.
271	
272	[Re-enter LUCIUS, QUINTUS, MARTIUS and MUTIUS, with
273	their swords bloody]
274	
275	LUCIUS	See, lord and father, how we have perform'd
276	Our Roman rites: Alarbus' limbs are lopp'd,
277	And entrails feed the sacrificing fire,
278	Whose smoke, like incense, doth perfume the sky.
279	Remaineth nought, but to inter our brethren,
280	And with loud 'larums welcome them to Rome.
281	
282	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Let it be so; and let Andronicus
283	Make this his latest farewell to their souls.
284	
285	[Trumpets sounded, and the coffin laid in the tomb]
286	
287	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons;
288	Rome's readiest champions, repose you here in rest,
289	Secure from worldly chances and mishaps!
290	Here lurks no treason, here no envy swells,
291	Here grow no damned grudges; here are no storms,
292	No noise, but silence and eternal sleep:
293	In peace and honour rest you here, my sons!
294	
295	[Enter LAVINIA]
296	
297	LAVINIA	In peace and honour live Lord Titus long;
298	My noble lord and father, live in fame!
299	Lo, at this tomb my tributary tears
300	I render, for my brethren's obsequies;
301	And at thy feet I kneel, with tears of joy,
302	Shed on the earth, for thy return to Rome:
303	O, bless me here with thy victorious hand,
304	Whose fortunes Rome's best citizens applaud!
305	
306	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Kind Rome, that hast thus lovingly reserved
307	The cordial of mine age to glad my heart!
308	Lavinia, live; outlive thy father's days,
309	And fame's eternal date, for virtue's praise!
310	
311	[Enter, below, MARCUS ANDRONICUS and Tribunes;
312	re-enter SATURNINUS and BASSIANUS, attended]
313	
314	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Long live Lord Titus, my beloved brother,
315	Gracious triumpher in the eyes of Rome!
316	
317	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Thanks, gentle tribune, noble brother Marcus.
318	
319	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	And welcome, nephews, from successful wars,
320	You that survive, and you that sleep in fame!
321	Fair lords, your fortunes are alike in all,
322	That in your country's service drew your swords:
323	But safer triumph is this funeral pomp,
324	That hath aspired to Solon's happiness
325	And triumphs over chance in honour's bed.
326	Titus Andronicus, the people of Rome,
327	Whose friend in justice thou hast ever been,
328	Send thee by me, their tribune and their trust,
329	This palliament of white and spotless hue;
330	And name thee in election for the empire,
331	With these our late-deceased emperor's sons:
332	Be candidatus then, and put it on,
333	And help to set a head on headless Rome.
334	
335	TITUS ANDRONICUS	A better head her glorious body fits
336	Than his that shakes for age and feebleness:
337	What should I don this robe, and trouble you?
338	Be chosen with proclamations to-day,
339	To-morrow yield up rule, resign my life,
340	And set abroad new business for you all?
341	Rome, I have been thy soldier forty years,
342	And led my country's strength successfully,
343	And buried one and twenty valiant sons,
344	Knighted in field, slain manfully in arms,
345	In right and service of their noble country
346	Give me a staff of honour for mine age,
347	But not a sceptre to control the world:
348	Upright he held it, lords, that held it last.
349	
350	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Titus, thou shalt obtain and ask the empery.
351	
352	SATURNINUS	Proud and ambitious tribune, canst thou tell?
353	
354	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Patience, Prince Saturninus.
355	
356	SATURNINUS	Romans, do me right:
357	Patricians, draw your swords: and sheathe them not
358	Till Saturninus be Rome's emperor.
359	Andronicus, would thou wert shipp'd to hell,
360	Rather than rob me of the people's hearts!
361	
362	LUCIUS	Proud Saturnine, interrupter of the good
363	That noble-minded Titus means to thee!
364	
365	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Content thee, prince; I will restore to thee
366	The people's hearts, and wean them from themselves.
367	
368	BASSIANUS	Andronicus, I do not flatter thee,
369	But honour thee, and will do till I die:
370	My faction if thou strengthen with thy friends,
371	I will most thankful be; and thanks to men
372	Of noble minds is honourable meed.
373	
374	TITUS ANDRONICUS	People of Rome, and people's tribunes here,
375	I ask your voices and your suffrages:
376	Will you bestow them friendly on Andronicus?
377	
378	Tribunes	To gratify the good Andronicus,
379	And gratulate his safe return to Rome,
380	The people will accept whom he admits.
381	
382	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tribunes, I thank you: and this suit I make,
383	That you create your emperor's eldest son,
384	Lord Saturnine; whose virtues will, I hope,
385	Reflect on Rome as Titan's rays on earth,
386	And ripen justice in this commonweal:
387	Then, if you will elect by my advice,
388	Crown him and say 'Long live our emperor!'
389	
390	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	With voices and applause of every sort,
391	Patricians and plebeians, we create
392	Lord Saturninus Rome's great emperor,
393	And say 'Long live our Emperor Saturnine!'
394	
395	[A long flourish till they come down]
396	
397	SATURNINUS	Titus Andronicus, for thy favors done
398	To us in our election this day,
399	I give thee thanks in part of thy deserts,
400	And will with deeds requite thy gentleness:
401	And, for an onset, Titus, to advance
402	Thy name and honourable family,
403	Lavinia will I make my empress,
404	Rome's royal mistress, mistress of my heart,
405	And in the sacred Pantheon her espouse:
406	Tell me, Andronicus, doth this motion please thee?
407	
408	TITUS ANDRONICUS	It doth, my worthy lord; and in this match
409	I hold me highly honour'd of your grace:
410	And here in sight of Rome to Saturnine,
411	King and commander of our commonweal,
412	The wide world's emperor, do I consecrate
413	My sword, my chariot and my prisoners;
414	Presents well worthy Rome's imperial lord:
415	Receive them then, the tribute that I owe,
416	Mine honour's ensigns humbled at thy feet.
417	
418	SATURNINUS	Thanks, noble Titus, father of my life!
419	How proud I am of thee and of thy gifts
420	Rome shall record, and when I do forget
421	The least of these unspeakable deserts,
422	Romans, forget your fealty to me.
423	
424	TITUS ANDRONICUS	[To TAMORA]  Now, madam, are you prisoner to
425	an emperor;
426	To him that, for your honour and your state,
427	Will use you nobly and your followers.
428	
429	SATURNINUS	A goodly lady, trust me; of the hue
430	That I would choose, were I to choose anew.
431	Clear up, fair queen, that cloudy countenance:
432	Though chance of war hath wrought this change of cheer,
433	Thou comest not to be made a scorn in Rome:
434	Princely shall be thy usage every way.
435	Rest on my word, and let not discontent
436	Daunt all your hopes: madam, he comforts you
437	Can make you greater than the Queen of Goths.
438	Lavinia, you are not displeased with this?
439	
440	LAVINIA	Not I, my lord; sith true nobility
441	Warrants these words in princely courtesy.
442	
443	SATURNINUS	Thanks, sweet Lavinia. Romans, let us go;
444	Ransomless here we set our prisoners free:
445	Proclaim our honours, lords, with trump and drum.
446	
447	[Flourish. SATURNINUS courts TAMORA in dumb show]
448	
449	BASSIANUS	Lord Titus, by your leave, this maid is mine.
450	
451	[Seizing LAVINIA]
452	
453	TITUS ANDRONICUS	How, sir! are you in earnest then, my lord?
454	
455	BASSIANUS	Ay, noble Titus; and resolved withal
456	To do myself this reason and this right.
457	
458	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	'Suum cuique' is our Roman justice:
459	This prince in justice seizeth but his own.
460	
461	LUCIUS	And that he will, and shall, if Lucius live.
462	
463	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Traitors, avaunt! Where is the emperor's guard?
464	Treason, my lord! Lavinia is surprised!
465	
466	SATURNINUS	Surprised! by whom?
467	
468	BASSIANUS	By him that justly may
469	Bear his betroth'd from all the world away.
470	
471	[Exeunt BASSIANUS and MARCUS with LAVINIA]
472	
473	MUTIUS	Brothers, help to convey her hence away,
474	And with my sword I'll keep this door safe.
475	
476	[Exeunt LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
477	
478	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Follow, my lord, and I'll soon bring her back.
479	
480	MUTIUS	My lord, you pass not here.
481	
482	
483	TITUS ANDRONICUS	What, villain boy!
484	Barr'st me my way in Rome?
485	
486	[Stabbing MUTIUS]
487	
488	MUTIUS	Help, Lucius, help!
489	
490	[Dies]
491	
492	[During the fray, SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS,
493	CHIRON and AARON go out and re-enter, above]
494	
495	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
496	
497	LUCIUS	My lord, you are unjust, and, more than so,
498	In wrongful quarrel you have slain your son.
499	
500	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Nor thou, nor he, are any sons of mine;
501	My sons would never so dishonour me:
502	Traitor, restore Lavinia to the emperor.
503	
504	LUCIUS	Dead, if you will; but not to be his wife,
505	That is another's lawful promised love.
506	
507	[Exit]
508	
509	SATURNINUS	No, Titus, no; the emperor needs her not,
510	Nor her, nor thee, nor any of thy stock:
511	I'll trust, by leisure, him that mocks me once;
512	Thee never, nor thy traitorous haughty sons,
513	Confederates all thus to dishonour me.
514	Was there none else in Rome to make a stale,
515	But Saturnine? Full well, Andronicus,
516	Agree these deeds with that proud brag of thine,
517	That said'st I begg'd the empire at thy hands.
518	
519	TITUS ANDRONICUS	O monstrous! what reproachful words are these?
520	
521	SATURNINUS	But go thy ways; go, give that changing piece
522	To him that flourish'd for her with his sword
523	A valiant son-in-law thou shalt enjoy;
524	One fit to bandy with thy lawless sons,
525	To ruffle in the commonwealth of Rome.
526	
527	TITUS ANDRONICUS	These words are razors to my wounded heart.
528	
529	SATURNINUS	And therefore, lovely Tamora, queen of Goths,
530	That like the stately Phoebe 'mongst her nymphs
531	Dost overshine the gallant'st dames of Rome,
532	If thou be pleased with this my sudden choice,
533	Behold, I choose thee, Tamora, for my bride,
534	And will create thee empress of Rome,
535	Speak, Queen of Goths, dost thou applaud my choice?
536	And here I swear by all the Roman gods,
537	Sith priest and holy water are so near
538	And tapers burn so bright and every thing
539	In readiness for Hymenaeus stand,
540	I will not re-salute the streets of Rome,
541	Or climb my palace, till from forth this place
542	I lead espoused my bride along with me.
543	
544	TAMORA	And here, in sight of heaven, to Rome I swear,
545	If Saturnine advance the Queen of Goths,
546	She will a handmaid be to his desires,
547	A loving nurse, a mother to his youth.
548	
549	SATURNINUS	Ascend, fair queen, Pantheon. Lords, accompany
550	Your noble emperor and his lovely bride,
551	Sent by the heavens for Prince Saturnine,
552	Whose wisdom hath her fortune conquered:
553	There shall we consummate our spousal rites.
554	
555	[Exeunt all but TITUS]
556	
557	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I am not bid to wait upon this bride.
558	Titus, when wert thou wont to walk alone,
559	Dishonour'd thus, and challenged of wrongs?
560	
561	[Re-enter MARCUS, LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
562	
563	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O Titus, see, O, see what thou hast done!
564	In a bad quarrel slain a virtuous son.
565	
566	TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, foolish tribune, no; no son of mine,
567	Nor thou, nor these, confederates in the deed
568	That hath dishonour'd all our family;
569	Unworthy brother, and unworthy sons!
570	
571	LUCIUS	But let us give him burial, as becomes;
572	Give Mutius burial with our brethren.
573	
574	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Traitors, away! he rests not in this tomb:
575	This monument five hundred years hath stood,
576	Which I have sumptuously re-edified:
577	Here none but soldiers and Rome's servitors
578	Repose in fame; none basely slain in brawls:
579	Bury him where you can; he comes not here.
580	
581	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, this is impiety in you:
582	My nephew Mutius' deeds do plead for him
583	He must be buried with his brethren.
584	
585	QUINTUS	|
586	| And shall, or him we will accompany.
587	MARTIUS	|
588	
589	
590	TITUS ANDRONICUS	'And shall!' what villain was it that spake
591	that word?
592	
593	QUINTUS	He that would vouch it in any place but here.
594	
595	TITUS ANDRONICUS	What, would you bury him in my despite?
596	
597	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	No, noble Titus, but entreat of thee
598	To pardon Mutius and to bury him.
599	
600	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Marcus, even thou hast struck upon my crest,
601	And, with these boys, mine honour thou hast wounded:
602	My foes I do repute you every one;
603	So, trouble me no more, but get you gone.
604	
605	MARTIUS	He is not with himself; let us withdraw.
606	
607	QUINTUS	Not I, till Mutius' bones be buried.
608	
609	[MARCUS and the Sons of TITUS kneel]
610	
611	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Brother, for in that name doth nature plead,--
612	
613	QUINTUS	Father, and in that name doth nature speak,--
614	
615	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Speak thou no more, if all the rest will speed.
616	
617	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Renowned Titus, more than half my soul,--
618	
619	LUCIUS	Dear father, soul and substance of us all,--
620	
621	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Suffer thy brother Marcus to inter
622	His noble nephew here in virtue's nest,
623	That died in honour and Lavinia's cause.
624	Thou art a Roman; be not barbarous:
625	The Greeks upon advice did bury Ajax
626	That slew himself; and wise Laertes' son
627	Did graciously plead for his funerals:
628	Let not young Mutius, then, that was thy joy
629	Be barr'd his entrance here.
630	
631	
632	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Rise, Marcus, rise.
633	The dismall'st day is this that e'er I saw,
634	To be dishonour'd by my sons in Rome!
635	Well, bury him, and bury me the next.
636	
637	[MUTIUS is put into the tomb]
638	
639	LUCIUS	There lie thy bones, sweet Mutius, with thy friends,
640	Till we with trophies do adorn thy tomb.
641	
642	All	[Kneeling]  No man shed tears for noble Mutius;
643	He lives in fame that died in virtue's cause.
644	
645	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, to step out of these dreary dumps,
646	How comes it that the subtle Queen of Goths
647	Is of a sudden thus advanced in Rome?
648	
649	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know not, Marcus; but I know it is,
650	Whether by device or no, the heavens can tell:
651	Is she not then beholding to the man
652	That brought her for this high good turn so far?
653	Yes, and will nobly him remunerate.
654	
655	[Flourish. Re-enter, from one side, SATURNINUS
656	attended, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON and AARON; from
657	the other, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, and others]
658	
659	SATURNINUS	So, Bassianus, you have play'd your prize:
660	God give you joy, sir, of your gallant bride!
661	
662	BASSIANUS	And you of yours, my lord! I say no more,
663	Nor wish no less; and so, I take my leave.
664	
665	SATURNINUS	Traitor, if Rome have law or we have power,
666	Thou and thy faction shall repent this rape.
667	
668	BASSIANUS	Rape, call you it, my lord, to seize my own,
669	My truth-betrothed love and now my wife?
670	But let the laws of Rome determine all;
671	Meanwhile I am possess'd of that is mine.
672	
673	SATURNINUS	'Tis good, sir: you are very short with us;
674	But, if we live, we'll be as sharp with you.
675	
676	BASSIANUS	My lord, what I have done, as best I may,
677	Answer I must and shall do with my life.
678	Only thus much I give your grace to know:
679	By all the duties that I owe to Rome,
680	This noble gentleman, Lord Titus here,
681	Is in opinion and in honour wrong'd;
682	That in the rescue of Lavinia
683	With his own hand did slay his youngest son,
684	In zeal to you and highly moved to wrath
685	To be controll'd in that he frankly gave:
686	Receive him, then, to favor, Saturnine,
687	That hath express'd himself in all his deeds
688	A father and a friend to thee and Rome.
689	
690	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Prince Bassianus, leave to plead my deeds:
691	'Tis thou and those that have dishonour'd me.
692	Rome and the righteous heavens be my judge,
693	How I have loved and honour'd Saturnine!
694	
695	TAMORA	My worthy lord, if ever Tamora
696	Were gracious in those princely eyes of thine,
697	Then hear me speak in indifferently for all;
698	And at my suit, sweet, pardon what is past.
699	
700	SATURNINUS	What, madam! be dishonour'd openly,
701	And basely put it up without revenge?
702	
703	TAMORA	Not so, my lord; the gods of Rome forfend
704	I should be author to dishonour you!
705	But on mine honour dare I undertake
706	For good Lord Titus' innocence in all;
707	Whose fury not dissembled speaks his griefs:
708	Then, at my suit, look graciously on him;
709	Lose not so noble a friend on vain suppose,
710	Nor with sour looks afflict his gentle heart.
711	[Aside to SATURNINUS]  My lord, be ruled by me,
712	be won at last;
713	Dissemble all your griefs and discontents:
714	You are but newly planted in your throne;
715	Lest, then, the people, and patricians too,
716	Upon a just survey, take Titus' part,
717	And so supplant you for ingratitude,
718	Which Rome reputes to be a heinous sin,
719	Yield at entreats; and then let me alone:
720	I'll find a day to massacre them all
721	And raze their faction and their family,
722	The cruel father and his traitorous sons,
723	To whom I sued for my dear son's life,
724	And make them know what 'tis to let a queen
725	Kneel in the streets and beg for grace in vain.
726	
727	[Aloud]
728	
729	Come, come, sweet emperor; come, Andronicus;
730	Take up this good old man, and cheer the heart
731	That dies in tempest of thy angry frown.
732	
733	SATURNINUS	Rise, Titus, rise; my empress hath prevail'd.
734	
735	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I thank your majesty, and her, my lord:
736	These words, these looks, infuse new life in me.
737	
738	TAMORA	Titus, I am incorporate in Rome,
739	A Roman now adopted happily,
740	And must advise the emperor for his good.
741	This day all quarrels die, Andronicus;
742	And let it be mine honour, good my lord,
743	That I have reconciled your friends and you.
744	For you, Prince Bassianus, I have pass'd
745	My word and promise to the emperor,
746	That you will be more mild and tractable.
747	And fear not lords, and you, Lavinia;
748	By my advice, all humbled on your knees,
749	You shall ask pardon of his majesty.
750	
751	LUCIUS	We do, and vow to heaven and to his highness,
752	That what we did was mildly as we might,
753	Tendering our sister's honour and our own.
754	
755	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	That, on mine honour, here I do protest.
756	
757	SATURNINUS	Away, and talk not; trouble us no more.
758	
759	TAMORA	Nay, nay, sweet emperor, we must all be friends:
760	The tribune and his nephews kneel for grace;
761	I will not be denied: sweet heart, look back.
762	
763	SATURNINUS	Marcus, for thy sake and thy brother's here,
764	And at my lovely Tamora's entreats,
765	I do remit these young men's heinous faults: Stand up.
766	Lavinia, though you left me like a churl,
767	I found a friend, and sure as death I swore
768	I would not part a bachelor from the priest.
769	Come, if the emperor's court can feast two brides,
770	You are my guest, Lavinia, and your friends.
771	This day shall be a love-day, Tamora.
772	
773	TITUS ANDRONICUS	To-morrow, an it please your majesty
774	To hunt the panther and the hart with me,
775	With horn and hound we'll give your grace bonjour.
776	
777	SATURNINUS	Be it so, Titus, and gramercy too.

787	ACT II
788	
789	
790	
791	SCENE I	Rome. Before the Palace.
792	
793	
794	[Enter AARON]
795	
796	AARON	Now climbeth Tamora Olympus' top,
797	Safe out of fortune's shot; and sits aloft,
798	Secure of thunder's crack or lightning flash;
799	Advanced above pale envy's threatening reach.
800	As when the golden sun salutes the morn,
801	And, having gilt the ocean with his beams,
802	Gallops the zodiac in his glistering coach,
803	And overlooks the highest-peering hills;
804	So Tamora:
805	Upon her wit doth earthly honour wait,
806	And virtue stoops and trembles at her frown.
807	Then, Aaron, arm thy heart, and fit thy thoughts,
808	To mount aloft with thy imperial mistress,
809	And mount her pitch, whom thou in triumph long
810	Hast prisoner held, fetter'd in amorous chains
811	And faster bound to Aaron's charming eyes
812	Than is Prometheus tied to Caucasus.
813	Away with slavish weeds and servile thoughts!
814	I will be bright, and shine in pearl and gold,
815	To wait upon this new-made empress.
816	To wait, said I? to wanton with this queen,
817	This goddess, this Semiramis, this nymph,
818	This siren, that will charm Rome's Saturnine,
819	And see his shipwreck and his commonweal's.
820	Holloa! what storm is this?
821	
822	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, braving]
823	
824	DEMETRIUS	Chiron, thy years want wit, thy wit wants edge,
825	And manners, to intrude where I am graced;
826	And may, for aught thou know'st, affected be.
827	
828	CHIRON	Demetrius, thou dost over-ween in all;
829	And so in this, to bear me down with braves.
830	'Tis not the difference of a year or two
831	Makes me less gracious or thee more fortunate:
832	I am as able and as fit as thou
833	To serve, and to deserve my mistress' grace;
834	And that my sword upon thee shall approve,
835	And plead my passions for Lavinia's love.
836	
837	AARON	[Aside]  Clubs, clubs! these lovers will not keep
838	the peace.
839	
840	DEMETRIUS	Why, boy, although our mother, unadvised,
841	Gave you a dancing-rapier by your side,
842	Are you so desperate grown, to threat your friends?
843	Go to; have your lath glued within your sheath
844	Till you know better how to handle it.
845	
846	CHIRON	Meanwhile, sir, with the little skill I have,
847	Full well shalt thou perceive how much I dare.
848	
849	DEMETRIUS	Ay, boy, grow ye so brave?
850	
851	[They draw]
852	
853	AARON	[Coming forward]  Why, how now, lords!
854	So near the emperor's palace dare you draw,
855	And maintain such a quarrel openly?
856	Full well I wot the ground of all this grudge:
857	I would not for a million of gold
858	The cause were known to them it most concerns;
859	Nor would your noble mother for much more
860	Be so dishonour'd in the court of Rome.
861	For shame, put up.
862	
863	DEMETRIUS	                  Not I, till I have sheathed
864	My rapier in his bosom and withal
865	Thrust these reproachful speeches down his throat
866	That he hath breathed in my dishonour here.
867	
868	CHIRON	For that I am prepared and full resolved.
869	Foul-spoken coward, that thunder'st with thy tongue,
870	And with thy weapon nothing darest perform!
871	
872	AARON	Away, I say!
873	Now, by the gods that warlike Goths adore,
874	This petty brabble will undo us all.
875	Why, lords, and think you not how dangerous
876	It is to jet upon a prince's right?
877	What, is Lavinia then become so loose,
878	Or Bassianus so degenerate,
879	That for her love such quarrels may be broach'd
880	Without controlment, justice, or revenge?
881	Young lords, beware! and should the empress know
882	This discord's ground, the music would not please.
883	
884	CHIRON	I care not, I, knew she and all the world:
885	I love Lavinia more than all the world.
886	
887	DEMETRIUS	Youngling, learn thou to make some meaner choice:
888	Lavinia is thine elder brother's hope.
889	
890	AARON	Why, are ye mad? or know ye not, in Rome
891	How furious and impatient they be,
892	And cannot brook competitors in love?
893	I tell you, lords, you do but plot your deaths
894	By this device.
895	
896	CHIRON	                  Aaron, a thousand deaths
897	Would I propose to achieve her whom I love.
898	
899	AARON	To achieve her! how?
900	
901	DEMETRIUS	Why makest thou it so strange?
902	She is a woman, therefore may be woo'd;
903	She is a woman, therefore may be won;
904	She is Lavinia, therefore must be loved.
905	What, man! more water glideth by the mill
906	Than wots the miller of; and easy it is
907	Of a cut loaf to steal a shive, we know:
908	Though Bassianus be the emperor's brother.
909	Better than he have worn Vulcan's badge.
910	
911	AARON	[Aside]  Ay, and as good as Saturninus may.
912	
913	DEMETRIUS	Then why should he despair that knows to court it
914	With words, fair looks and liberality?
915	What, hast not thou full often struck a doe,
916	And borne her cleanly by the keeper's nose?
917	
918	AARON	Why, then, it seems, some certain snatch or so
919	Would serve your turns.
920	
921	CHIRON	Ay, so the turn were served.
922	
923	DEMETRIUS	Aaron, thou hast hit it.
924	
925	AARON	Would you had hit it too!
926	Then should not we be tired with this ado.
927	Why, hark ye, hark ye! and are you such fools
928	To square for this? would it offend you, then
929	That both should speed?
930	
931	CHIRON	Faith, not me.
932	
933	DEMETRIUS	                  Nor me, so I were one.
934	
935	AARON	For shame, be friends, and join for that you jar:
936	'Tis policy and stratagem must do
937	That you affect; and so must you resolve,
938	That what you cannot as you would achieve,
939	You must perforce accomplish as you may.
940	Take this of me: Lucrece was not more chaste
941	Than this Lavinia, Bassianus' love.
942	A speedier course than lingering languishment
943	Must we pursue, and I have found the path.
944	My lords, a solemn hunting is in hand;
945	There will the lovely Roman ladies troop:
946	The forest walks are wide and spacious;
947	And many unfrequented plots there are
948	Fitted by kind for rape and villany:
949	Single you thither then this dainty doe,
950	And strike her home by force, if not by words:
951	This way, or not at all, stand you in hope.
952	Come, come, our empress, with her sacred wit
953	To villany and vengeance consecrate,
954	Will we acquaint with all that we intend;
955	And she shall file our engines with advice,
956	That will not suffer you to square yourselves,
957	But to your wishes' height advance you both.
958	The emperor's court is like the house of Fame,
959	The palace full of tongues, of eyes, and ears:
960	The woods are ruthless, dreadful, deaf, and dull;
961	There speak, and strike, brave boys, and take
962	your turns;
963	There serve your lusts, shadow'd from heaven's eye,
964	And revel in Lavinia's treasury.
965	
966	CHIRON	Thy counsel, lad, smells of no cowardice,
967	
968	DEMETRIUS	Sit fas aut nefas, till I find the stream
969	To cool this heat, a charm to calm these fits.
970	Per Styga, per manes vehor.

985	
986	
987	[Enter TITUS ANDRONICUS, with Hunters, &c., MARCUS,
988	LUCIUS, QUINTUS, and MARTIUS]
989	
990	TITUS ANDRONICUS	The hunt is up, the morn is bright and grey,
991	The fields are fragrant and the woods are green:
992	Uncouple here and let us make a bay
993	And wake the emperor and his lovely bride
994	And rouse the prince and ring a hunter's peal,
995	That all the court may echo with the noise.
996	Sons, let it be your charge, as it is ours,
997	To attend the emperor's person carefully:
998	I have been troubled in my sleep this night,
999	But dawning day new comfort hath inspired.
1000	
1001	[A cry of hounds and horns, winded in a peal. Enter
1002	SATURNINUS, TAMORA, BASSIANUS, LAVINIA, DEMETRIUS,
1003	CHIRON, and Attendants]
1004	
1005	Many good morrows to your majesty;
1006	Madam, to you as many and as good:
1007	I promised your grace a hunter's peal.
1008	
1009	SATURNINUS	And you have rung it lustily, my lord;
1010	Somewhat too early for new-married ladies.
1011	
1012	BASSIANUS	Lavinia, how say you?
1013	
1014	LAVINIA	I say, no;
1015	I have been broad awake two hours and more.
1016	
1017	SATURNINUS	Come on, then; horse and chariots let us have,
1018	And to our sport.
1019	
1020	[To TAMORA]
1021	
1022	Madam, now shall ye see
1023	Our Roman hunting.
1024	
1025	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	                  I have dogs, my lord,
1026	Will rouse the proudest panther in the chase,
1027	And climb the highest promontory top.
1028	
1029	TITUS ANDRONICUS	And I have horse will follow where the game
1030	Makes way, and run like swallows o'er the plain.
1031	
1032	DEMETRIUS	Chiron, we hunt not, we, with horse nor hound,
1033	But hope to pluck a dainty doe to ground.

1049	
1050	[Enter AARON, with a bag of gold]
1051	
1052	AARON	He that had wit would think that I had none,
1053	To bury so much gold under a tree,
1054	And never after to inherit it.
1055	Let him that thinks of me so abjectly
1056	Know that this gold must coin a stratagem,
1057	Which, cunningly effected, will beget
1058	A very excellent piece of villany:
1059	And so repose, sweet gold, for their unrest
1060	
1061	[Hides the gold]
1062	
1063	That have their alms out of the empress' chest.
1064	
1065	[Enter TAMORA]
1066	
1067	TAMORA	My lovely Aaron, wherefore look'st thou sad,
1068	When every thing doth make a gleeful boast?
1069	The birds chant melody on every bush,
1070	The snake lies rolled in the cheerful sun,
1071	The green leaves quiver with the cooling wind
1072	And make a chequer'd shadow on the ground:
1073	Under their sweet shade, Aaron, let us sit,
1074	And, whilst the babbling echo mocks the hounds,
1075	Replying shrilly to the well-tuned horns,
1076	As if a double hunt were heard at once,
1077	Let us sit down and mark their yelping noise;
1078	And, after conflict such as was supposed
1079	The wandering prince and Dido once enjoy'd,
1080	When with a happy storm they were surprised
1081	And curtain'd with a counsel-keeping cave,
1082	We may, each wreathed in the other's arms,
1083	Our pastimes done, possess a golden slumber;
1084	Whiles hounds and horns and sweet melodious birds
1085	Be unto us as is a nurse's song
1086	Of lullaby to bring her babe asleep.
1087	
1088	AARON	Madam, though Venus govern your desires,
1089	Saturn is dominator over mine:
1090	What signifies my deadly-standing eye,
1091	My silence and my cloudy melancholy,
1092	My fleece of woolly hair that now uncurls
1093	Even as an adder when she doth unroll
1094	To do some fatal execution?
1095	No, madam, these are no venereal signs:
1096	Vengeance is in my heart, death in my hand,
1097	Blood and revenge are hammering in my head.
1098	Hark Tamora, the empress of my soul,
1099	Which never hopes more heaven than rests in thee,
1100	This is the day of doom for Bassianus:
1101	His Philomel must lose her tongue to-day,
1102	Thy sons make pillage of her chastity
1103	And wash their hands in Bassianus' blood.
1104	Seest thou this letter? take it up, I pray thee,
1105	And give the king this fatal plotted scroll.
1106	Now question me no more; we are espied;
1107	Here comes a parcel of our hopeful booty,
1108	Which dreads not yet their lives' destruction.
1109	
1110	TAMORA	Ah, my sweet Moor, sweeter to me than life!
1111	
1112	AARON	No more, great empress; Bassianus comes:
1113	Be cross with him; and I'll go fetch thy sons
1114	To back thy quarrels, whatsoe'er they be.
1115	
1116	[Exit]
1117	
1118	[Enter BASSIANUS and LAVINIA]
1119	
1120	BASSIANUS	Who have we here? Rome's royal empress,
1121	Unfurnish'd of her well-beseeming troop?
1122	Or is it Dian, habited like her,
1123	Who hath abandoned her holy groves
1124	To see the general hunting in this forest?
1125	
1126	TAMORA	Saucy controller of our private steps!
1127	Had I the power that some say Dian had,
1128	Thy temples should be planted presently
1129	With horns, as was Actaeon's; and the hounds
1130	Should drive upon thy new-transformed limbs,
1131	Unmannerly intruder as thou art!
1132	
1133	LAVINIA	Under your patience, gentle empress,
1134	'Tis thought you have a goodly gift in horning;
1135	And to be doubted that your Moor and you
1136	Are singled forth to try experiments:
1137	Jove shield your husband from his hounds to-day!
1138	'Tis pity they should take him for a stag.
1139	
1140	BASSIANUS	Believe me, queen, your swarth Cimmerian
1141	Doth make your honour of his body's hue,
1142	Spotted, detested, and abominable.
1143	Why are you sequester'd from all your train,
1144	Dismounted from your snow-white goodly steed.
1145	And wander'd hither to an obscure plot,
1146	Accompanied but with a barbarous Moor,
1147	If foul desire had not conducted you?
1148	
1149	LAVINIA	And, being intercepted in your sport,
1150	Great reason that my noble lord be rated
1151	For sauciness. I pray you, let us hence,
1152	And let her joy her raven-colour'd love;
1153	This valley fits the purpose passing well.
1154	
1155	BASSIANUS	The king my brother shall have note of this.
1156	
1157	LAVINIA	Ay, for these slips have made him noted long:
1158	Good king, to be so mightily abused!
1159	
1160	TAMORA	Why have I patience to endure all this?
1161	
1162	[Enter DEMETRIUS and CHIRON]
1163	
1164	DEMETRIUS	How now, dear sovereign, and our gracious mother!
1165	Why doth your highness look so pale and wan?
1166	
1167	TAMORA	Have I not reason, think you, to look pale?
1168	These two have 'ticed me hither to this place:
1169	A barren detested vale, you see it is;
1170	The trees, though summer, yet forlorn and lean,
1171	O'ercome with moss and baleful mistletoe:
1172	Here never shines the sun; here nothing breeds,
1173	Unless the nightly owl or fatal raven:
1174	And when they show'd me this abhorred pit,
1175	They told me, here, at dead time of the night,
1176	A thousand fiends, a thousand hissing snakes,
1177	Ten thousand swelling toads, as many urchins,
1178	Would make such fearful and confused cries
1179	As any mortal body hearing it
1180	Should straight fall mad, or else die suddenly.
1181	No sooner had they told this hellish tale,
1182	But straight they told me they would bind me here
1183	Unto the body of a dismal yew,
1184	And leave me to this miserable death:
1185	And then they call'd me foul adulteress,
1186	Lascivious Goth, and all the bitterest terms
1187	That ever ear did hear to such effect:
1188	And, had you not by wondrous fortune come,
1189	This vengeance on me had they executed.
1190	Revenge it, as you love your mother's life,
1191	Or be ye not henceforth call'd my children.
1192	
1193	DEMETRIUS	This is a witness that I am thy son.
1194	
1195	[Stabs BASSIANUS]
1196	
1197	CHIRON	And this for me, struck home to show my strength.
1198	
1199	[Also stabs BASSIANUS, who dies]
1200	
1201	LAVINIA	Ay, come, Semiramis, nay, barbarous Tamora,
1202	For no name fits thy nature but thy own!
1203	
1204	TAMORA	Give me thy poniard; you shall know, my boys
1205	Your mother's hand shall right your mother's wrong.
1206	
1207	DEMETRIUS	Stay, madam; here is more belongs to her;
1208	First thrash the corn, then after burn the straw:
1209	This minion stood upon her chastity,
1210	Upon her nuptial vow, her loyalty,
1211	And with that painted hope braves your mightiness:
1212	And shall she carry this unto her grave?
1213	
1214	CHIRON	An if she do, I would I were an eunuch.
1215	Drag hence her husband to some secret hole,
1216	And make his dead trunk pillow to our lust.
1217	
1218	TAMORA	But when ye have the honey ye desire,
1219	Let not this wasp outlive, us both to sting.
1220	
1221	CHIRON	I warrant you, madam, we will make that sure.
1222	Come, mistress, now perforce we will enjoy
1223	That nice-preserved honesty of yours.
1224	
1225	LAVINIA	O Tamora! thou bear'st a woman's face,--
1226	
1227	TAMORA	I will not hear her speak; away with her!
1228	
1229	LAVINIA	Sweet lords, entreat her hear me but a word.
1230	
1231	DEMETRIUS	Listen, fair madam: let it be your glory
1232	To see her tears; but be your heart to them
1233	As unrelenting flint to drops of rain.
1234	
1235	LAVINIA	When did the tiger's young ones teach the dam?
1236	O, do not learn her wrath; she taught it thee;
1237	The milk thou suck'dst from her did turn to marble;
1238	Even at thy teat thou hadst thy tyranny.
1239	Yet every mother breeds not sons alike:
1240	
1241	[To CHIRON]
1242	
1243	Do thou entreat her show a woman pity.
1244	
1245	CHIRON	What, wouldst thou have me prove myself a bastard?
1246	
1247	LAVINIA	'Tis true; the raven doth not hatch a lark:
1248	Yet have I heard,--O, could I find it now!--
1249	The lion moved with pity did endure
1250	To have his princely paws pared all away:
1251	Some say that ravens foster forlorn children,
1252	The whilst their own birds famish in their nests:
1253	O, be to me, though thy hard heart say no,
1254	Nothing so kind, but something pitiful!
1255	
1256	TAMORA	I know not what it means; away with her!
1257	
1258	LAVINIA	O, let me teach thee! for my father's sake,
1259	That gave thee life, when well he might have
1260	slain thee,
1261	Be not obdurate, open thy deaf ears.
1262	
1263	TAMORA	Hadst thou in person ne'er offended me,
1264	Even for his sake am I pitiless.
1265	Remember, boys, I pour'd forth tears in vain,
1266	To save your brother from the sacrifice;
1267	But fierce Andronicus would not relent;
1268	Therefore, away with her, and use her as you will,
1269	The worse to her, the better loved of me.
1270	
1271	LAVINIA	O Tamora, be call'd a gentle queen,
1272	And with thine own hands kill me in this place!
1273	For 'tis not life that I have begg'd so long;
1274	Poor I was slain when Bassianus died.
1275	
1276	TAMORA	What begg'st thou, then? fond woman, let me go.
1277	
1278	LAVINIA	'Tis present death I beg; and one thing more
1279	That womanhood denies my tongue to tell:
1280	O, keep me from their worse than killing lust,
1281	And tumble me into some loathsome pit,
1282	Where never man's eye may behold my body:
1283	Do this, and be a charitable murderer.
1284	
1285	TAMORA	So should I rob my sweet sons of their fee:
1286	No, let them satisfy their lust on thee.
1287	
1288	DEMETRIUS	Away! for thou hast stay'd us here too long.
1289	
1290	LAVINIA	No grace? no womanhood? Ah, beastly creature!
1291	The blot and enemy to our general name!
1292	Confusion fall--
1293	
1294	CHIRON	Nay, then I'll stop your mouth. Bring thou her husband:
1295	This is the hole where Aaron bid us hide him.
1296	
1297	[DEMETRIUS throws the body of BASSIANUS into the
1298	pit; then exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON, dragging
1299	off LAVINIA]
1300	
1301	TAMORA	Farewell, my sons: see that you make her sure.
1302	Ne'er let my heart know merry cheer indeed,
1303	Till all the Andronici be made away.
1304	Now will I hence to seek my lovely Moor,
1305	And let my spleenful sons this trull deflow'r.
1306	
1307	[Exit]
1308	
1309	[Re-enter AARON, with QUINTUS and MARTIUS]
1310	
1311	AARON	Come on, my lords, the better foot before:
1312	Straight will I bring you to the loathsome pit
1313	Where I espied the panther fast asleep.
1314	
1315	QUINTUS	My sight is very dull, whate'er it bodes.
1316	
1317	MARTIUS	And mine, I promise you; were't not for shame,
1318	Well could I leave our sport to sleep awhile.
1319	
1320	[Falls into the pit]
1321	
1322	QUINTUS	What art thou fall'n? What subtle hole is this,
1323	Whose mouth is cover'd with rude-growing briers,
1324	Upon whose leaves are drops of new-shed blood
1325	As fresh as morning dew distill'd on flowers?
1326	A very fatal place it seems to me.
1327	
1328	Speak, brother, hast thou hurt thee with the fall?
1329	
1330	MARTIUS	O brother, with the dismall'st object hurt
1331	That ever eye with sight made heart lament!
1332	
1333	AARON	[Aside]  Now will I fetch the king to find them here,
1334	That he thereby may give a likely guess
1335	How these were they that made away his brother.
1336	
1337	[Exit]
1338	
1339	MARTIUS	Why dost not comfort me, and help me out
1340	From this unhallowed and blood-stained hole?
1341	
1342	QUINTUS	I am surprised with an uncouth fear;
1343	A chilling sweat o'er-runs my trembling joints:
1344	My heart suspects more than mine eye can see.
1345	
1346	MARTIUS	To prove thou hast a true-divining heart,
1347	Aaron and thou look down into this den,
1348	And see a fearful sight of blood and death.
1349	
1350	QUINTUS	Aaron is gone; and my compassionate heart
1351	Will not permit mine eyes once to behold
1352	The thing whereat it trembles by surmise;
1353	O, tell me how it is; for ne'er till now
1354	Was I a child to fear I know not what.
1355	
1356	MARTIUS	Lord Bassianus lies embrewed here,
1357	All on a heap, like to a slaughter'd lamb,
1358	In this detested, dark, blood-drinking pit.
1359	
1360	QUINTUS	If it be dark, how dost thou know 'tis he?
1361	
1362	MARTIUS	Upon his bloody finger he doth wear
1363	A precious ring, that lightens all the hole,
1364	Which, like a taper in some monument,
1365	Doth shine upon the dead man's earthy cheeks,
1366	And shows the ragged entrails of the pit:
1367	So pale did shine the moon on Pyramus
1368	When he by night lay bathed in maiden blood.
1369	O brother, help me with thy fainting hand--
1370	If fear hath made thee faint, as me it hath--
1371	Out of this fell devouring receptacle,
1372	As hateful as Cocytus' misty mouth.
1373	
1374	QUINTUS	Reach me thy hand, that I may help thee out;
1375	Or, wanting strength to do thee so much good,
1376	I may be pluck'd into the swallowing womb
1377	Of this deep pit, poor Bassianus' grave.
1378	I have no strength to pluck thee to the brink.
1379	
1380	MARTIUS	Nor I no strength to climb without thy help.
1381	
1382	QUINTUS	Thy hand once more; I will not loose again,
1383	Till thou art here aloft, or I below:
1384	Thou canst not come to me: I come to thee.
1385	
1386	[Falls in]
1387	
1388	[Enter SATURNINUS with AARON]
1389	
1390	SATURNINUS	Along with me: I'll see what hole is here,
1391	And what he is that now is leap'd into it.
1392	Say who art thou that lately didst descend
1393	Into this gaping hollow of the earth?
1394	
1395	MARTIUS	The unhappy son of old Andronicus:
1396	Brought hither in a most unlucky hour,
1397	To find thy brother Bassianus dead.
1398	
1399	SATURNINUS	My brother dead! I know thou dost but jest:
1400	He and his lady both are at the lodge
1401	Upon the north side of this pleasant chase;
1402	'Tis not an hour since I left him there.
1403	
1404	MARTIUS	We know not where you left him all alive;
1405	But, out, alas! here have we found him dead.
1406	
1407	[Re-enter TAMORA, with Attendants; TITUS
1408	ANDRONICUS, and Lucius]
1409	
1410	TAMORA	Where is my lord the king?
1411	
1412	SATURNINUS	Here, Tamora, though grieved with killing grief.
1413	
1414	TAMORA	Where is thy brother Bassianus?
1415	
1416	SATURNINUS	Now to the bottom dost thou search my wound:
1417	Poor Bassianus here lies murdered.
1418	
1419	TAMORA	Then all too late I bring this fatal writ,
1420	The complot of this timeless tragedy;
1421	And wonder greatly that man's face can fold
1422	In pleasing smiles such murderous tyranny.
1423	
1424	[She giveth SATURNINUS a letter]
1425	
1426	SATURNINUS	[Reads]  'An if we miss to meet him handsomely--
1427	Sweet huntsman, Bassianus 'tis we mean--
1428	Do thou so much as dig the grave for him:
1429	Thou know'st our meaning. Look for thy reward
1430	Among the nettles at the elder-tree
1431	Which overshades the mouth of that same pit
1432	Where we decreed to bury Bassianus.
1433	Do this, and purchase us thy lasting friends.'
1434	O Tamora! was ever heard the like?
1435	This is the pit, and this the elder-tree.
1436	Look, sirs, if you can find the huntsman out
1437	That should have murdered Bassianus here.
1438	
1439	AARON	My gracious lord, here is the bag of gold.
1440	
1441	SATURNINUS	[To TITUS]  Two of thy whelps, fell curs of
1442	bloody kind,
1443	Have here bereft my brother of his life.
1444	Sirs, drag them from the pit unto the prison:
1445	There let them bide until we have devised
1446	Some never-heard-of torturing pain for them.
1447	
1448	TAMORA	What, are they in this pit? O wondrous thing!
1449	How easily murder is discovered!
1450	
1451	TITUS ANDRONICUS	High emperor, upon my feeble knee
1452	I beg this boon, with tears not lightly shed,
1453	That this fell fault of my accursed sons,
1454	Accursed if the fault be proved in them,--
1455	
1456	SATURNINUS	If it be proved! you see it is apparent.
1457	Who found this letter? Tamora, was it you?
1458	
1459	TAMORA	Andronicus himself did take it up.
1460	
1461	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I did, my lord: yet let me be their bail;
1462	For, by my father's reverend tomb, I vow
1463	They shall be ready at your highness' will
1464	To answer their suspicion with their lives.
1465	
1466	SATURNINUS	Thou shalt not bail them: see thou follow me.
1467	Some bring the murder'd body, some the murderers:
1468	Let them not speak a word; the guilt is plain;
1469	For, by my soul, were there worse end than death,
1470	That end upon them should be executed.
1471	
1472	TAMORA	Andronicus, I will entreat the king;
1473	Fear not thy sons; they shall do well enough.

1516	MARCUS	Who is this? my niece, that flies away so fast!
1517	Cousin, a word; where is your husband?
1518	If I do dream, would all my wealth would wake me!
1519	If I do wake, some planet strike me down,
1520	That I may slumber in eternal sleep!
1521	Speak, gentle niece, what stern ungentle hands
1522	Have lopp'd and hew'd and made thy body bare
1523	Of her two branches, those sweet ornaments,
1524	Whose circling shadows kings have sought to sleep in,
1525	And might not gain so great a happiness
1526	As have thy love? Why dost not speak to me?
1527	Alas, a crimson river of warm blood,
1528	Like to a bubbling fountain stirr'd with wind,
1529	Doth rise and fall between thy rosed lips,
1530	Coming and going with thy honey breath.
1531	But, sure, some Tereus hath deflowered thee,
1532	And, lest thou shouldst detect him, cut thy tongue.
1533	Ah, now thou turn'st away thy face for shame!
1534	And, notwithstanding all this loss of blood,
1535	As from a conduit with three issuing spouts,
1536	Yet do thy cheeks look red as Titan's face
1537	Blushing to be encountered with a cloud.
1538	Shall I speak for thee? shall I say 'tis so?
1539	O, that I knew thy heart; and knew the beast,
1540	That I might rail at him, to ease my mind!
1541	Sorrow concealed, like an oven stopp'd,
1542	Doth burn the heart to cinders where it is.
1543	Fair Philomela, she but lost her tongue,
1544	And in a tedious sampler sew'd her mind:
1545	But, lovely niece, that mean is cut from thee;
1546	A craftier Tereus, cousin, hast thou met,
1547	And he hath cut those pretty fingers off,
1548	That could have better sew'd than Philomel.
1549	O, had the monster seen those lily hands
1550	Tremble, like aspen-leaves, upon a lute,
1551	And make the silken strings delight to kiss them,
1552	He would not then have touch'd them for his life!
1553	Or, had he heard the heavenly harmony
1554	Which that sweet tongue hath made,
1555	He would have dropp'd his knife, and fell asleep
1556	As Cerberus at the Thracian poet's feet.
1557	Come, let us go, and make thy father blind;
1558	For such a sight will blind a father's eye:
1559	One hour's storm will drown the fragrant meads;
1560	What will whole months of tears thy father's eyes?
1561	Do not draw back, for we will mourn with thee
1562	O, could our mourning ease thy misery!

1581	execution; TITUS going before, pleading]
1582	
1583	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Hear me, grave fathers! noble tribunes, stay!
1584	For pity of mine age, whose youth was spent
1585	In dangerous wars, whilst you securely slept;
1586	For all my blood in Rome's great quarrel shed;
1587	For all the frosty nights that I have watch'd;
1588	And for these bitter tears, which now you see
1589	Filling the aged wrinkles in my cheeks;
1590	Be pitiful to my condemned sons,
1591	Whose souls are not corrupted as 'tis thought.
1592	For two and twenty sons I never wept,
1593	Because they died in honour's lofty bed.
1594	
1595	[Lieth down; the Judges, &c., pass by him, and Exeunt]
1596	
1597	For these, these, tribunes, in the dust I write
1598	My heart's deep languor and my soul's sad tears:
1599	Let my tears stanch the earth's dry appetite;
1600	My sons' sweet blood will make it shame and blush.
1601	O earth, I will befriend thee more with rain,
1602	That shall distil from these two ancient urns,
1603	Than youthful April shall with all his showers:
1604	In summer's drought I'll drop upon thee still;
1605	In winter with warm tears I'll melt the snow
1606	And keep eternal spring-time on thy face,
1607	So thou refuse to drink my dear sons' blood.
1608	
1609	[Enter LUCIUS, with his sword drawn]
1610	
1611	O reverend tribunes! O gentle, aged men!
1612	Unbind my sons, reverse the doom of death;
1613	And let me say, that never wept before,
1614	My tears are now prevailing orators.
1615	
1616	LUCIUS	O noble father, you lament in vain:
1617	The tribunes hear you not; no man is by;
1618	And you recount your sorrows to a stone.
1619	
1620	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ah, Lucius, for thy brothers let me plead.
1621	Grave tribunes, once more I entreat of you,--
1622	
1623	LUCIUS	My gracious lord, no tribune hears you speak.
1624	
1625	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, tis no matter, man; if they did hear,
1626	They would not mark me, or if they did mark,
1627	They would not pity me, yet plead I must;
1628	And bootless unto them [                  ]
1629	Therefore I tell my sorrows to the stones;
1630	Who, though they cannot answer my distress,
1631	Yet in some sort they are better than the tribunes,
1632	For that they will not intercept my tale:
1633	When I do weep, they humbly at my feet
1634	Receive my tears and seem to weep with me;
1635	And, were they but attired in grave weeds,
1636	Rome could afford no tribune like to these.
1637	A stone is soft as wax,--tribunes more hard than stones;
1638	A stone is silent, and offendeth not,
1639	And tribunes with their tongues doom men to death.
1640	
1641	[Rises]
1642	
1643	But wherefore stand'st thou with thy weapon drawn?
1644	
1645	LUCIUS	To rescue my two brothers from their death:
1646	For which attempt the judges have pronounced
1647	My everlasting doom of banishment.
1648	
1649	TITUS ANDRONICUS	O happy man! they have befriended thee.
1650	Why, foolish Lucius, dost thou not perceive
1651	That Rome is but a wilderness of tigers?
1652	Tigers must prey, and Rome affords no prey
1653	But me and mine: how happy art thou, then,
1654	From these devourers to be banished!
1655	But who comes with our brother Marcus here?
1656	
1657	[Enter MARCUS and LAVINIA]
1658	
1659	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Titus, prepare thy aged eyes to weep;
1660	Or, if not so, thy noble heart to break:
1661	I bring consuming sorrow to thine age.
1662	
1663	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Will it consume me? let me see it, then.
1664	
1665	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This was thy daughter.
1666	
1667	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, Marcus, so she is.
1668	
1669	LUCIUS	Ay me, this object kills me!
1670	
1671	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Faint-hearted boy, arise, and look upon her.
1672	Speak, Lavinia, what accursed hand
1673	Hath made thee handless in thy father's sight?
1674	What fool hath added water to the sea,
1675	Or brought a faggot to bright-burning Troy?
1676	My grief was at the height before thou camest,
1677	And now like Nilus, it disdaineth bounds.
1678	Give me a sword, I'll chop off my hands too;
1679	For they have fought for Rome, and all in vain;
1680	And they have nursed this woe, in feeding life;
1681	In bootless prayer have they been held up,
1682	And they have served me to effectless use:
1683	Now all the service I require of them
1684	Is that the one will help to cut the other.
1685	'Tis well, Lavinia, that thou hast no hands;
1686	For hands, to do Rome service, are but vain.
1687	
1688	LUCIUS	Speak, gentle sister, who hath martyr'd thee?
1689	
1690	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, that delightful engine of her thoughts
1691	That blabb'd them with such pleasing eloquence,
1692	Is torn from forth that pretty hollow cage,
1693	Where, like a sweet melodious bird, it sung
1694	Sweet varied notes, enchanting every ear!
1695	
1696	LUCIUS	O, say thou for her, who hath done this deed?
1697	
1698	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, thus I found her, straying in the park,
1699	Seeking to hide herself, as doth the deer
1700	That hath received some unrecuring wound.
1701	
1702	TITUS ANDRONICUS	It was my deer; and he that wounded her
1703	Hath hurt me more than had he killed me dead:
1704	For now I stand as one upon a rock
1705	Environed with a wilderness of sea,
1706	Who marks the waxing tide grow wave by wave,
1707	Expecting ever when some envious surge
1708	Will in his brinish bowels swallow him.
1709	This way to death my wretched sons are gone;
1710	Here stands my other son, a banished man,
1711	And here my brother, weeping at my woes.
1712	But that which gives my soul the greatest spurn,
1713	Is dear Lavinia, dearer than my soul.
1714	Had I but seen thy picture in this plight,
1715	It would have madded me: what shall I do
1716	Now I behold thy lively body so?
1717	Thou hast no hands, to wipe away thy tears:
1718	Nor tongue, to tell me who hath martyr'd thee:
1719	Thy husband he is dead: and for his death
1720	Thy brothers are condemn'd, and dead by this.
1721	Look, Marcus! ah, son Lucius, look on her!
1722	When I did name her brothers, then fresh tears
1723	Stood on her cheeks, as doth the honey-dew
1724	Upon a gather'd lily almost wither'd.
1725	
1726	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Perchance she weeps because they kill'd her husband;
1727	Perchance because she knows them innocent.
1728	
1729	TITUS ANDRONICUS	If they did kill thy husband, then be joyful
1730	Because the law hath ta'en revenge on them.
1731	No, no, they would not do so foul a deed;
1732	Witness the sorrow that their sister makes.
1733	Gentle Lavinia, let me kiss thy lips.
1734	Or make some sign how I may do thee ease:
1735	Shall thy good uncle, and thy brother Lucius,
1736	And thou, and I, sit round about some fountain,
1737	Looking all downwards to behold our cheeks
1738	How they are stain'd, as meadows, yet not dry,
1739	With miry slime left on them by a flood?
1740	And in the fountain shall we gaze so long
1741	Till the fresh taste be taken from that clearness,
1742	And made a brine-pit with our bitter tears?
1743	Or shall we cut away our hands, like thine?
1744	Or shall we bite our tongues, and in dumb shows
1745	Pass the remainder of our hateful days?
1746	What shall we do? let us, that have our tongues,
1747	Plot some deuce of further misery,
1748	To make us wonder'd at in time to come.
1749	
1750	LUCIUS	Sweet father, cease your tears; for, at your grief,
1751	See how my wretched sister sobs and weeps.
1752	
1753	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Patience, dear niece. Good Titus, dry thine eyes.
1754	
1755	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ah, Marcus, Marcus! brother, well I wot
1756	Thy napkin cannot drink a tear of mine,
1757	For thou, poor man, hast drown'd it with thine own.
1758	
1759	LUCIUS	Ah, my Lavinia, I will wipe thy cheeks.
1760	
1761	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Mark, Marcus, mark! I understand her signs:
1762	Had she a tongue to speak, now would she say
1763	That to her brother which I said to thee:
1764	His napkin, with his true tears all bewet,
1765	Can do no service on her sorrowful cheeks.
1766	O, what a sympathy of woe is this,
1767	As far from help as Limbo is from bliss!
1768	
1769	[Enter AARON]
1770	
1771	AARON	Titus Andronicus, my lord the emperor
1772	Sends thee this word,--that, if thou love thy sons,
1773	Let Marcus, Lucius, or thyself, old Titus,
1774	Or any one of you, chop off your hand,
1775	And send it to the king: he for the same
1776	Will send thee hither both thy sons alive;
1777	And that shall be the ransom for their fault.
1778	
1779	TITUS ANDRONICUS	O gracious emperor! O gentle Aaron!
1780	Did ever raven sing so like a lark,
1781	That gives sweet tidings of the sun's uprise?
1782	With all my heart, I'll send the emperor My hand:
1783	Good Aaron, wilt thou help to chop it off?
1784	
1785	LUCIUS	Stay, father! for that noble hand of thine,
1786	That hath thrown down so many enemies,
1787	Shall not be sent: my hand will serve the turn:
1788	My youth can better spare my blood than you;
1789	And therefore mine shall save my brothers' lives.
1790	
1791	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	 Which of your hands hath not defended Rome,
1792	And rear'd aloft the bloody battle-axe,
1793	Writing destruction on the enemy's castle?
1794	O, none of both but are of high desert:
1795	My hand hath been but idle; let it serve
1796	To ransom my two nephews from their death;
1797	Then have I kept it to a worthy end.
1798	
1799	AARON	Nay, come, agree whose hand shall go along,
1800	For fear they die before their pardon come.
1801	
1802	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My hand shall go.
1803	
1804	LUCIUS	                  By heaven, it shall not go!
1805	
1806	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirs, strive no more: such wither'd herbs as these
1807	Are meet for plucking up, and therefore mine.
1808	
1809	LUCIUS	Sweet father, if I shall be thought thy son,
1810	Let me redeem my brothers both from death.
1811	
1812	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	And, for our father's sake and mother's care,
1813	Now let me show a brother's love to thee.
1814	
1815	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Agree between you; I will spare my hand.
1816	
1817	LUCIUS	Then I'll go fetch an axe.
1818	
1819	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	But I will use the axe.
1820	
1821	[Exeunt LUCIUS and MARCUS]
1822	
1823	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come hither, Aaron; I'll deceive them both:
1824	Lend me thy hand, and I will give thee mine.
1825	
1826	AARON	[Aside]  If that be call'd deceit, I will be honest,
1827	And never, whilst I live, deceive men so:
1828	But I'll deceive you in another sort,
1829	And that you'll say, ere half an hour pass.
1830	
1831	[Cuts off TITUS's hand]
1832	
1833	[Re-enter LUCIUS and MARCUS]
1834	
1835	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Now stay your strife: what shall be is dispatch'd.
1836	Good Aaron, give his majesty my hand:
1837	Tell him it was a hand that warded him
1838	From thousand dangers; bid him bury it
1839	More hath it merited; that let it have.
1840	As for my sons, say I account of them
1841	As jewels purchased at an easy price;
1842	And yet dear too, because I bought mine own.
1843	
1844	AARON	I go, Andronicus: and for thy hand
1845	Look by and by to have thy sons with thee.
1846	
1847	[Aside]
1848	
1849	Their heads, I mean. O, how this villany
1850	Doth fat me with the very thoughts of it!
1851	Let fools do good, and fair men call for grace.
1852	Aaron will have his soul black like his face.
1853	
1854	[Exit]
1855	
1856	TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, here I lift this one hand up to heaven,
1857	And bow this feeble ruin to the earth:
1858	If any power pities wretched tears,
1859	To that I call!
1860	
1861	[To LAVINIA]
1862	What, wilt thou kneel with me?
1863	Do, then, dear heart; for heaven shall hear our prayers;
1864	Or with our sighs we'll breathe the welkin dim,
1865	And stain the sun with fog, as sometime clouds
1866	When they do hug him in their melting bosoms.
1867	
1868	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O brother, speak with possibilities,
1869	And do not break into these deep extremes.
1870	
1871	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Is not my sorrow deep, having no bottom?
1872	Then be my passions bottomless with them.
1873	
1874	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	But yet let reason govern thy lament.
1875	
1876	TITUS ANDRONICUS	If there were reason for these miseries,
1877	Then into limits could I bind my woes:
1878	When heaven doth weep, doth not the earth o'erflow?
1879	If the winds rage, doth not the sea wax mad,
1880	Threatening the welkin with his big-swoln face?
1881	And wilt thou have a reason for this coil?
1882	I am the sea; hark, how her sighs do blow!
1883	She is the weeping welkin, I the earth:
1884	Then must my sea be moved with her sighs;
1885	Then must my earth with her continual tears
1886	Become a deluge, overflow'd and drown'd;
1887	For why my bowels cannot hide her woes,
1888	But like a drunkard must I vomit them.
1889	Then give me leave, for losers will have leave
1890	To ease their stomachs with their bitter tongues.
1891	
1892	[Enter a Messenger, with two heads and a hand]
1893	
1894	Messenger	Worthy Andronicus, ill art thou repaid
1895	For that good hand thou sent'st the emperor.
1896	Here are the heads of thy two noble sons;
1897	And here's thy hand, in scorn to thee sent back;
1898	Thy griefs their sports, thy resolution mock'd;
1899	That woe is me to think upon thy woes
1900	More than remembrance of my father's death.
1901	
1902	[Exit]
1903	
1904	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now let hot AEtna cool in Sicily,
1905	And be my heart an ever-burning hell!
1906	These miseries are more than may be borne.
1907	To weep with them that weep doth ease some deal;
1908	But sorrow flouted at is double death.
1909	
1910	LUCIUS	Ah, that this sight should make so deep a wound,
1911	And yet detested life not shrink thereat!
1912	That ever death should let life bear his name,
1913	Where life hath no more interest but to breathe!
1914	
1915	[LAVINIA kisses TITUS]
1916	
1917	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, poor heart, that kiss is comfortless
1918	As frozen water to a starved snake.
1919	
1920	TITUS ANDRONICUS	When will this fearful slumber have an end?
1921	
1922	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now, farewell, flattery: die, Andronicus;
1923	Thou dost not slumber: see, thy two sons' heads,
1924	Thy warlike hand, thy mangled daughter here:
1925	Thy other banish'd son, with this dear sight
1926	Struck pale and bloodless; and thy brother, I,
1927	Even like a stony image, cold and numb.
1928	Ah, now no more will I control thy griefs:
1929	Rend off thy silver hair, thy other hand
1930	Gnawing with thy teeth; and be this dismal sight
1931	The closing up of our most wretched eyes;
1932	Now is a time to storm; why art thou still?
1933	
1934	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ha, ha, ha!
1935	
1936	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Why dost thou laugh? it fits not with this hour.
1937	
1938	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, I have not another tear to shed:
1939	Besides, this sorrow is an enemy,
1940	And would usurp upon my watery eyes
1941	And make them blind with tributary tears:
1942	Then which way shall I find Revenge's cave?
1943	For these two heads do seem to speak to me,
1944	And threat me I shall never come to bliss
1945	Till all these mischiefs be return'd again
1946	Even in their throats that have committed them.
1947	Come, let me see what task I have to do.
1948	You heavy people, circle me about,
1949	That I may turn me to each one of you,
1950	And swear unto my soul to right your wrongs.
1951	The vow is made. Come, brother, take a head;
1952	And in this hand the other I will bear.
1953	Lavinia, thou shalt be employ'd: these arms!
1954	Bear thou my hand, sweet wench, between thy teeth.
1955	As for thee, boy, go get thee from my sight;
1956	Thou art an exile, and thou must not stay:
1957	Hie to the Goths, and raise an army there:
1958	And, if you love me, as I think you do,
1959	Let's kiss and part, for we have much to do.
1960	
1961	[Exeunt TITUS, MARCUS, and LAVINIA]
1962	
1963	LUCIUS	Farewell Andronicus, my noble father,
1964	The wofull'st man that ever lived in Rome:
1965	Farewell, proud Rome; till Lucius come again,
1966	He leaves his pledges dearer than his life:
1967	Farewell, Lavinia, my noble sister;
1968	O, would thou wert as thou tofore hast been!
1969	But now nor Lucius nor Lavinia lives
1970	But in oblivion and hateful griefs.
1971	If Lucius live, he will requite your wrongs;
1972	And make proud Saturnine and his empress
1973	Beg at the gates, like Tarquin and his queen.
1974	Now will I to the Goths, and raise a power,
1975	To be revenged on Rome and Saturnine.

1985	ACT III
1986	
1987	
1988	
1989	SCENE II	A room in Titus's house. A banquet set out.
1990	
1991	
1992	[Enter TITUS, MARCUS, LAVINIA and Young LUCIUS, a boy]
1993	
1994	TITUS ANDRONICUS	So, so; now sit: and look you eat no more
1995	Than will preserve just so much strength in us
1996	As will revenge these bitter woes of ours.
1997	Marcus, unknit that sorrow-wreathen knot:
1998	Thy niece and I, poor creatures, want our hands,
1999	And cannot passionate our tenfold grief
2000	With folded arms. This poor right hand of mine
2001	Is left to tyrannize upon my breast;
2002	Who, when my heart, all mad with misery,
2003	Beats in this hollow prison of my flesh,
2004	Then thus I thump it down.
2005	
2006	[To LAVINIA]
2007	
2008	Thou map of woe, that thus dost talk in signs!
2009	When thy poor heart beats with outrageous beating,
2010	Thou canst not strike it thus to make it still.
2011	Wound it with sighing, girl, kill it with groans;
2012	Or get some little knife between thy teeth,
2013	And just against thy heart make thou a hole;
2014	That all the tears that thy poor eyes let fall
2015	May run into that sink, and soaking in
2016	Drown the lamenting fool in sea-salt tears.
2017	
2018	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Fie, brother, fie! teach her not thus to lay
2019	Such violent hands upon her tender life.
2020	
2021	TITUS ANDRONICUS	How now! has sorrow made thee dote already?
2022	Why, Marcus, no man should be mad but I.
2023	What violent hands can she lay on her life?
2024	Ah, wherefore dost thou urge the name of hands;
2025	To bid AEneas tell the tale twice o'er,
2026	How Troy was burnt and he made miserable?
2027	O, handle not the theme, to talk of hands,
2028	Lest we remember still that we have none.
2029	Fie, fie, how franticly I square my talk,
2030	As if we should forget we had no hands,
2031	If Marcus did not name the word of hands!
2032	Come, let's fall to; and, gentle girl, eat this:
2033	Here is no drink! Hark, Marcus, what she says;
2034	I can interpret all her martyr'd signs;
2035	She says she drinks no other drink but tears,
2036	Brew'd with her sorrow, mesh'd upon her cheeks:
2037	Speechless complainer, I will learn thy thought;
2038	In thy dumb action will I be as perfect
2039	As begging hermits in their holy prayers:
2040	Thou shalt not sigh, nor hold thy stumps to heaven,
2041	Nor wink, nor nod, nor kneel, nor make a sign,
2042	But I of these will wrest an alphabet
2043	And by still practise learn to know thy meaning.
2044	
2045	Young LUCIUS	Good grandsire, leave these bitter deep laments:
2046	Make my aunt merry with some pleasing tale.
2047	
2048	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, the tender boy, in passion moved,
2049	Doth weep to see his grandsire's heaviness.
2050	
2051	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Peace, tender sapling; thou art made of tears,
2052	And tears will quickly melt thy life away.
2053	
2054	[MARCUS strikes the dish with a knife]
2055	
2056	What dost thou strike at, Marcus, with thy knife?
2057	
2058	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	At that that I have kill'd, my lord; a fly.
2059	
2060	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Out on thee, murderer! thou kill'st my heart;
2061	Mine eyes are cloy'd with view of tyranny:
2062	A deed of death done on the innocent
2063	Becomes not Titus' brother: get thee gone:
2064	I see thou art not for my company.
2065	
2066	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, my lord, I have but kill'd a fly.
2067	
2068	TITUS ANDRONICUS	But how, if that fly had a father and mother?
2069	How would he hang his slender gilded wings,
2070	And buzz lamenting doings in the air!
2071	Poor harmless fly,
2072	That, with his pretty buzzing melody,
2073	Came here to make us merry! and thou hast
2074	kill'd him.
2075	
2076	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Pardon me, sir; it was a black ill-favor'd fly,
2077	Like to the empress' Moor; therefore I kill'd him.
2078	
2079	TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, O, O,
2080	Then pardon me for reprehending thee,
2081	For thou hast done a charitable deed.
2082	Give me thy knife, I will insult on him;
2083	Flattering myself, as if it were the Moor
2084	Come hither purposely to poison me.--
2085	There's for thyself, and that's for Tamora.
2086	Ah, sirrah!
2087	Yet, I think, we are not brought so low,
2088	But that between us we can kill a fly
2089	That comes in likeness of a coal-black Moor.
2090	
2091	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Alas, poor man! grief has so wrought on him,
2092	He takes false shadows for true substances.
2093	
2094	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, take away. Lavinia, go with me:
2095	I'll to thy closet; and go read with thee
2096	Sad stories chanced in the times of old.
2097	Come, boy, and go with me: thy sight is young,
2098	And thou shalt read when mine begin to dazzle.
2099	
2100	[Exeunt]

2108	ACT IV
2109	
2110	
2111	
2112	SCENE I	Rome. Titus's garden.
2113	
2114	
2115	[Enter young LUCIUS, and LAVINIA running after him,
2116	and the boy flies from her, with books under his
2117	arm. Then enter TITUS and MARCUS]
2118	
2119	Young LUCIUS	Help, grandsire, help! my aunt Lavinia
2120	Follows me every where, I know not why:
2121	Good uncle Marcus, see how swift she comes.
2122	Alas, sweet aunt, I know not what you mean.
2123	
2124	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Stand by me, Lucius; do not fear thine aunt.
2125	
2126	TITUS ANDRONICUS	She loves thee, boy, too well to do thee harm.
2127	
2128	Young LUCIUS	Ay, when my father was in Rome she did.
2129	
2130	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	What means my niece Lavinia by these signs?
2131	
2132	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Fear her not, Lucius: somewhat doth she mean:
2133	See, Lucius, see how much she makes of thee:
2134	Somewhither would she have thee go with her.
2135	Ah, boy, Cornelia never with more care
2136	Read to her sons than she hath read to thee
2137	Sweet poetry and Tully's Orator.
2138	
2139	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Canst thou not guess wherefore she plies thee thus?
2140	
2141	Young LUCIUS	My lord, I know not, I, nor can I guess,
2142	Unless some fit or frenzy do possess her:
2143	For I have heard my grandsire say full oft,
2144	Extremity of griefs would make men mad;
2145	And I have read that Hecuba of Troy
2146	Ran mad through sorrow: that made me to fear;
2147	Although, my lord, I know my noble aunt
2148	Loves me as dear as e'er my mother did,
2149	And would not, but in fury, fright my youth:
2150	Which made me down to throw my books, and fly--
2151	Causeless, perhaps. But pardon me, sweet aunt:
2152	And, madam, if my uncle Marcus go,
2153	I will most willingly attend your ladyship.
2154	
2155	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Lucius, I will.
2156	
2157	[LAVINIA turns over with her stumps the books which
2158	LUCIUS has let fall]
2159	
2160	TITUS ANDRONICUS	How now, Lavinia! Marcus, what means this?
2161	Some book there is that she desires to see.
2162	Which is it, girl, of these? Open them, boy.
2163	But thou art deeper read, and better skill'd
2164	Come, and take choice of all my library,
2165	And so beguile thy sorrow, till the heavens
2166	Reveal the damn'd contriver of this deed.
2167	Why lifts she up her arms in sequence thus?
2168	
2169	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	I think she means that there was more than one
2170	Confederate in the fact: ay, more there was;
2171	Or else to heaven she heaves them for revenge.
2172	
2173	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Lucius, what book is that she tosseth so?
2174	
2175	Young LUCIUS	Grandsire, 'tis Ovid's Metamorphoses;
2176	My mother gave it me.
2177	
2178	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	For love of her that's gone,
2179	Perhaps she cull'd it from among the rest.
2180	
2181	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Soft! see how busily she turns the leaves!
2182	
2183	[Helping her]
2184	
2185	What would she find? Lavinia, shall I read?
2186	This is the tragic tale of Philomel,
2187	And treats of Tereus' treason and his rape:
2188	And rape, I fear, was root of thine annoy.
2189	
2190	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	See, brother, see; note how she quotes the leaves.
2191	
2192	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Lavinia, wert thou thus surprised, sweet girl,
2193	Ravish'd and wrong'd, as Philomela was,
2194	Forced in the ruthless, vast, and gloomy woods? See, see!
2195	Ay, such a place there is, where we did hunt--
2196	O, had we never, never hunted there!--
2197	Pattern'd by that the poet here describes,
2198	By nature made for murders and for rapes.
2199	
2200	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, why should nature build so foul a den,
2201	Unless the gods delight in tragedies?
2202	
2203	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Give signs, sweet girl, for here are none
2204	but friends,
2205	What Roman lord it was durst do the deed:
2206	Or slunk not Saturnine, as Tarquin erst,
2207	That left the camp to sin in Lucrece' bed?
2208	
2209	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Sit down, sweet niece: brother, sit down by me.
2210	Apollo, Pallas, Jove, or Mercury,
2211	Inspire me, that I may this treason find!
2212	My lord, look here: look here, Lavinia:
2213	This sandy plot is plain; guide, if thou canst
2214	This after me, when I have writ my name
2215	Without the help of any hand at all.
2216	
2217	[He writes his name with his staff, and guides it
2218	with feet and mouth]
2219	
2220	Cursed be that heart that forced us to this shift!
2221	Write thou good niece; and here display, at last,
2222	What God will have discover'd for revenge;
2223	Heaven guide thy pen to print thy sorrows plain,
2224	That we may know the traitors and the truth!
2225	
2226	[She takes the staff in her mouth, and guides it
2227	with her stumps, and writes]
2228	
2229	TITUS ANDRONICUS	O, do ye read, my lord, what she hath writ?
2230	'Stuprum. Chiron. Demetrius.'
2231	
2232	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	What, what! the lustful sons of Tamora
2233	Performers of this heinous, bloody deed?
2234	
2235	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Magni Dominator poli,
2236	Tam lentus audis scelera? tam lentus vides?
2237	
2238	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O, calm thee, gentle lord; although I know
2239	There is enough written upon this earth
2240	To stir a mutiny in the mildest thoughts
2241	And arm the minds of infants to exclaims.
2242	My lord, kneel down with me; Lavinia, kneel;
2243	And kneel, sweet boy, the Roman Hector's hope;
2244	And swear with me, as, with the woful fere
2245	And father of that chaste dishonour'd dame,
2246	Lord Junius Brutus sware for Lucrece' rape,
2247	That we will prosecute by good advice
2248	Mortal revenge upon these traitorous Goths,
2249	And see their blood, or die with this reproach.
2250	
2251	TITUS ANDRONICUS	'Tis sure enough, an you knew how.
2252	But if you hunt these bear-whelps, then beware:
2253	The dam will wake; and, if she wind you once,
2254	She's with the lion deeply still in league,
2255	And lulls him whilst she playeth on her back,
2256	And when he sleeps will she do what she list.
2257	You are a young huntsman, Marcus; let it alone;
2258	And, come, I will go get a leaf of brass,
2259	And with a gad of steel will write these words,
2260	And lay it by: the angry northern wind
2261	Will blow these sands, like Sibyl's leaves, abroad,
2262	And where's your lesson, then? Boy, what say you?
2263	
2264	Young LUCIUS	I say, my lord, that if I were a man,
2265	Their mother's bed-chamber should not be safe
2266	For these bad bondmen to the yoke of Rome.
2267	
2268	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Ay, that's my boy! thy father hath full oft
2269	For his ungrateful country done the like.
2270	
2271	Young LUCIUS	And, uncle, so will I, an if I live.
2272	
2273	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, go with me into mine armoury;
2274	Lucius, I'll fit thee; and withal, my boy,
2275	Shalt carry from me to the empress' sons
2276	Presents that I intend to send them both:
2277	Come, come; thou'lt do thy message, wilt thou not?
2278	
2279	Young LUCIUS	Ay, with my dagger in their bosoms, grandsire.
2280	
2281	TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, boy, not so; I'll teach thee another course.
2282	Lavinia, come. Marcus, look to my house:
2283	Lucius and I'll go brave it at the court:
2284	Ay, marry, will we, sir; and we'll be waited on.
2285	
2286	[Exeunt TITUS, LAVINIA, and Young LUCIUS]
2287	
2288	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O heavens, can you hear a good man groan,
2289	And not relent, or not compassion him?
2290	Marcus, attend him in his ecstasy,
2291	That hath more scars of sorrow in his heart
2292	Than foemen's marks upon his batter'd shield;
2293	But yet so just that he will not revenge.
2294	Revenge, ye heavens, for old Andronicus!
2295	
2296	[Exit]
2297

2302	
2303	
2304	ACT IV
2305	
2306	
2307	
2308	SCENE II	The same. A room in the palace.
2309	
2310	
2311	[Enter, from one side, AARON, DEMETRIUS, and
2312	CHIRON; from the other side, Young LUCIUS, and an
2313	Attendant, with a bundle of weapons, and verses
2314	writ upon them]
2315	
2316	CHIRON	Demetrius, here's the son of Lucius;
2317	He hath some message to deliver us.
2318	
2319	AARON	Ay, some mad message from his mad grandfather.
2320	
2321	Young LUCIUS	My lords, with all the humbleness I may,
2322	I greet your honours from Andronicus.
2323	
2324	[Aside]
2325	
2326	And pray the Roman gods confound you both!
2327	
2328	DEMETRIUS	Gramercy, lovely Lucius: what's the news?
2329	
2330	Young LUCIUS	[Aside]  That you are both decipher'd, that's the news,
2331	For villains mark'd with rape.--May it please you,
2332	My grandsire, well advised, hath sent by me
2333	The goodliest weapons of his armoury
2334	To gratify your honourable youth,
2335	The hope of Rome; for so he bade me say;
2336	And so I do, and with his gifts present
2337	Your lordships, that, whenever you have need,
2338	You may be armed and appointed well:
2339	And so I leave you both:
2340	
2341	[Aside]
2342	like bloody villains.
2343	
2344	[Exeunt Young LUCIUS, and Attendant]
2345	
2346	DEMETRIUS	What's here? A scroll; and written round about?
2347	Let's see;
2348	
2349	[Reads]
2350	
2351	'Integer vitae, scelerisque purus,
2352	Non eget Mauri jaculis, nec arcu.'
2353	
2354	CHIRON	O, 'tis a verse in Horace; I know it well:
2355	I read it in the grammar long ago.
2356	
2357	AARON	Ay, just; a verse in Horace; right, you have it.
2358	
2359	[Aside]
2360	
2361	Now, what a thing it is to be an ass!
2362	Here's no sound jest! the old man hath found their guilt;
2363	And sends them weapons wrapped about with lines,
2364	That wound, beyond their feeling, to the quick.
2365	But were our witty empress well afoot,
2366	She would applaud Andronicus' conceit:
2367	But let her rest in her unrest awhile.
2368	
2369	And now, young lords, was't not a happy star
2370	Led us to Rome, strangers, and more than so,
2371	Captives, to be advanced to this height?
2372	It did me good, before the palace gate
2373	To brave the tribune in his brother's hearing.
2374	
2375	DEMETRIUS	But me more good, to see so great a lord
2376	Basely insinuate and send us gifts.
2377	
2378	AARON	Had he not reason, Lord Demetrius?
2379	Did you not use his daughter very friendly?
2380	
2381	DEMETRIUS	I would we had a thousand Roman dames
2382	At such a bay, by turn to serve our lust.
2383	
2384	CHIRON	A charitable wish and full of love.
2385	
2386	AARON	Here lacks but your mother for to say amen.
2387	
2388	CHIRON	And that would she for twenty thousand more.
2389	
2390	DEMETRIUS	Come, let us go; and pray to all the gods
2391	For our beloved mother in her pains.
2392	
2393	AARON	[Aside]  Pray to the devils; the gods have given us over.
2394	
2395	[Trumpets sound within]
2396	
2397	DEMETRIUS	Why do the emperor's trumpets flourish thus?
2398	
2399	CHIRON	Belike, for joy the emperor hath a son.
2400	
2401	DEMETRIUS	Soft! who comes here?
2402	
2403	[Enter a Nurse, with a blackamoor Child in her arms]
2404	
2405	Nurse	Good morrow, lords:
2406	O, tell me, did you see Aaron the Moor?
2407	
2408	AARON	Well, more or less, or ne'er a whit at all,
2409	Here Aaron is; and what with Aaron now?
2410	
2411	Nurse	O gentle Aaron, we are all undone!
2412	Now help, or woe betide thee evermore!
2413	
2414	AARON	Why, what a caterwauling dost thou keep!
2415	What dost thou wrap and fumble in thine arms?
2416	
2417	Nurse	O, that which I would hide from heaven's eye,
2418	Our empress' shame, and stately Rome's disgrace!
2419	She is deliver'd, lords; she is deliver'd.
2420	
2421	AARON	To whom?
2422	
2423	Nurse	       I mean, she is brought a-bed.
2424	
2425	AARON	Well, God give her good rest! What hath he sent her?
2426	
2427	Nurse	A devil.
2428	
2429	AARON	Why, then she is the devil's dam; a joyful issue.
2430	
2431	Nurse	A joyless, dismal, black, and sorrowful issue:
2432	Here is the babe, as loathsome as a toad
2433	Amongst the fairest breeders of our clime:
2434	The empress sends it thee, thy stamp, thy seal,
2435	And bids thee christen it with thy dagger's point.
2436	
2437	AARON	'Zounds, ye whore! is black so base a hue?
2438	Sweet blowse, you are a beauteous blossom, sure.
2439	
2440	DEMETRIUS	Villain, what hast thou done?
2441	
2442	AARON	That which thou canst not undo.
2443	
2444	CHIRON	Thou hast undone our mother.
2445	
2446	AARON	Villain, I have done thy mother.
2447	
2448	DEMETRIUS	And therein, hellish dog, thou hast undone.
2449	Woe to her chance, and damn'd her loathed choice!
2450	Accursed the offspring of so foul a fiend!
2451	
2452	CHIRON	It shall not live.
2453	
2454	AARON	It shall not die.
2455	
2456	Nurse	Aaron, it must; the mother wills it so.
2457	
2458	AARON	What, must it, nurse? then let no man but I
2459	Do execution on my flesh and blood.
2460	
2461	DEMETRIUS	I'll broach the tadpole on my rapier's point:
2462	Nurse, give it me; my sword shall soon dispatch it.
2463	
2464	AARON	Sooner this sword shall plough thy bowels up.
2465	
2466	[Takes the Child from the Nurse, and draws]
2467	
2468	Stay, murderous villains! will you kill your brother?
2469	Now, by the burning tapers of the sky,
2470	That shone so brightly when this boy was got,
2471	He dies upon my scimitar's sharp point
2472	That touches this my first-born son and heir!
2473	I tell you, younglings, not Enceladus,
2474	With all his threatening band of Typhon's brood,
2475	Nor great Alcides, nor the god of war,
2476	Shall seize this prey out of his father's hands.
2477	What, what, ye sanguine, shallow-hearted boys!
2478	Ye white-limed walls! ye alehouse painted signs!
2479	Coal-black is better than another hue,
2480	In that it scorns to bear another hue;
2481	For all the water in the ocean
2482	Can never turn the swan's black legs to white,
2483	Although she lave them hourly in the flood.
2484	Tell the empress from me, I am of age
2485	To keep mine own, excuse it how she can.
2486	
2487	DEMETRIUS	Wilt thou betray thy noble mistress thus?
2488	
2489	AARON	My mistress is my mistress; this myself,
2490	The vigour and the picture of my youth:
2491	This before all the world do I prefer;
2492	This maugre all the world will I keep safe,
2493	Or some of you shall smoke for it in Rome.
2494	
2495	DEMETRIUS	By this our mother is forever shamed.
2496	
2497	CHIRON	Rome will despise her for this foul escape.
2498	
2499	Nurse	The emperor, in his rage, will doom her death.
2500	
2501	CHIRON	I blush to think upon this ignomy.
2502	
2503	AARON	Why, there's the privilege your beauty bears:
2504	Fie, treacherous hue, that will betray with blushing
2505	The close enacts and counsels of the heart!
2506	Here's a young lad framed of another leer:
2507	Look, how the black slave smiles upon the father,
2508	As who should say 'Old lad, I am thine own.'
2509	He is your brother, lords, sensibly fed
2510	Of that self-blood that first gave life to you,
2511	And from that womb where you imprison'd were
2512	He is enfranchised and come to light:
2513	Nay, he is your brother by the surer side,
2514	Although my seal be stamped in his face.
2515	
2516	Nurse	Aaron, what shall I say unto the empress?
2517	
2518	DEMETRIUS	Advise thee, Aaron, what is to be done,
2519	And we will all subscribe to thy advice:
2520	Save thou the child, so we may all be safe.
2521	
2522	AARON	Then sit we down, and let us all consult.
2523	My son and I will have the wind of you:
2524	Keep there: now talk at pleasure of your safety.
2525	
2526	[They sit]
2527	
2528	DEMETRIUS	How many women saw this child of his?
2529	
2530	AARON	Why, so, brave lords! when we join in league,
2531	I am a lamb: but if you brave the Moor,
2532	The chafed boar, the mountain lioness,
2533	The ocean swells not so as Aaron storms.
2534	But say, again; how many saw the child?
2535	
2536	Nurse	Cornelia the midwife and myself;
2537	And no one else but the deliver'd empress.
2538	
2539	AARON	The empress, the midwife, and yourself:
2540	Two may keep counsel when the third's away:
2541	Go to the empress, tell her this I said.
2542	
2543	[He kills the nurse]
2544	
2545	Weke, weke! so cries a pig prepared to the spit.
2546	
2547	DEMETRIUS	What mean'st thou, Aaron? wherefore didst thou this?
2548	
2549	AARON	O Lord, sir, 'tis a deed of policy:
2550	Shall she live to betray this guilt of ours,
2551	A long-tongued babbling gossip? no, lords, no:
2552	And now be it known to you my full intent.
2553	Not far, one Muli lives, my countryman;
2554	His wife but yesternight was brought to bed;
2555	His child is like to her, fair as you are:
2556	Go pack with him, and give the mother gold,
2557	And tell them both the circumstance of all;
2558	And how by this their child shall be advanced,
2559	And be received for the emperor's heir,
2560	And substituted in the place of mine,
2561	To calm this tempest whirling in the court;
2562	And let the emperor dandle him for his own.
2563	Hark ye, lords; ye see I have given her physic,
2564	
2565	[Pointing to the nurse]
2566	
2567	And you must needs bestow her funeral;
2568	The fields are near, and you are gallant grooms:
2569	This done, see that you take no longer days,
2570	But send the midwife presently to me.
2571	The midwife and the nurse well made away,
2572	Then let the ladies tattle what they please.
2573	
2574	CHIRON	Aaron, I see thou wilt not trust the air
2575	With secrets.
2576	
2577	DEMETRIUS	                  For this care of Tamora,
2578	Herself and hers are highly bound to thee.
2579	
2580	[Exeunt DEMETRIUS and CHIRON bearing off the
2581	Nurse's body]
2582	
2583	AARON	Now to the Goths, as swift as swallow flies;
2584	There to dispose this treasure in mine arms,
2585	And secretly to greet the empress' friends.
2586	Come on, you thick lipp'd slave, I'll bear you hence;
2587	For it is you that puts us to our shifts:
2588	I'll make you feed on berries and on roots,
2589	And feed on curds and whey, and suck the goat,
2590	And cabin in a cave, and bring you up
2591	To be a warrior, and command a camp.

2603	
2604	
2605	SCENE III	The same. A public place.
2606	
2607	
2608	[Enter TITUS, bearing arrows with letters at the
2609	ends of them; with him, MARCUS, Young LUCIUS,
2610	PUBLIUS, SEMPRONIUS, CAIUS, and other Gentlemen,
2611	with bows]
2612	
2613	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Marcus; come, kinsmen; this is the way.
2614	Sir boy, now let me see your archery;
2615	Look ye draw home enough, and 'tis there straight.
2616	Terras Astraea reliquit:
2617	Be you remember'd, Marcus, she's gone, she's fled.
2618	Sirs, take you to your tools. You, cousins, shall
2619	Go sound the ocean, and cast your nets;
2620	Happily you may catch her in the sea;
2621	Yet there's as little justice as at land:
2622	No; Publius and Sempronius, you must do it;
2623	'Tis you must dig with mattock and with spade,
2624	And pierce the inmost centre of the earth:
2625	Then, when you come to Pluto's region,
2626	I pray you, deliver him this petition;
2627	Tell him, it is for justice and for aid,
2628	And that it comes from old Andronicus,
2629	Shaken with sorrows in ungrateful Rome.
2630	Ah, Rome! Well, well; I made thee miserable
2631	What time I threw the people's suffrages
2632	On him that thus doth tyrannize o'er me.
2633	Go, get you gone; and pray be careful all,
2634	And leave you not a man-of-war unsearch'd:
2635	This wicked emperor may have shipp'd her hence;
2636	And, kinsmen, then we may go pipe for justice.
2637	
2638	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	O Publius, is not this a heavy case,
2639	To see thy noble uncle thus distract?
2640	
2641	PUBLIUS	Therefore, my lord, it highly us concerns
2642	By day and night to attend him carefully,
2643	And feed his humour kindly as we may,
2644	Till time beget some careful remedy.
2645	
2646	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Kinsmen, his sorrows are past remedy.
2647	Join with the Goths; and with revengeful war
2648	Take wreak on Rome for this ingratitude,
2649	And vengeance on the traitor Saturnine.
2650	
2651	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Publius, how now! how now, my masters!
2652	What, have you met with her?
2653	
2654	PUBLIUS	No, my good lord; but Pluto sends you word,
2655	If you will have Revenge from hell, you shall:
2656	Marry, for Justice, she is so employ'd,
2657	He thinks, with Jove in heaven, or somewhere else,
2658	So that perforce you must needs stay a time.
2659	
2660	TITUS ANDRONICUS	He doth me wrong to feed me with delays.
2661	I'll dive into the burning lake below,
2662	And pull her out of Acheron by the heels.
2663	Marcus, we are but shrubs, no cedars we
2664	No big-boned men framed of the Cyclops' size;
2665	But metal, Marcus, steel to the very back,
2666	Yet wrung with wrongs more than our backs can bear:
2667	And, sith there's no justice in earth nor hell,
2668	We will solicit heaven and move the gods
2669	To send down Justice for to wreak our wrongs.
2670	Come, to this gear. You are a good archer, Marcus;
2671	
2672	[He gives them the arrows]
2673	
2674	'Ad Jovem,' that's for you: here, 'Ad Apollinem:'
2675	'Ad Martem,' that's for myself:
2676	Here, boy, to Pallas: here, to Mercury:
2677	To Saturn, Caius, not to Saturnine;
2678	You were as good to shoot against the wind.
2679	To it, boy! Marcus, loose when I bid.
2680	Of my word, I have written to effect;
2681	There's not a god left unsolicited.
2682	
2683	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Kinsmen, shoot all your shafts into the court:
2684	We will afflict the emperor in his pride.
2685	
2686	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Now, masters, draw.
2687	
2688	[They shoot]
2689	O, well said, Lucius!
2690	Good boy, in Virgo's lap; give it Pallas.
2691	
2692	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	My lord, I aim a mile beyond the moon;
2693	Your letter is with Jupiter by this.
2694	
2695	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Ha, ha!
2696	Publius, Publius, what hast thou done?
2697	See, see, thou hast shot off one of Taurus' horns.
2698	
2699	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This was the sport, my lord: when Publius shot,
2700	The Bull, being gall'd, gave Aries such a knock
2701	That down fell both the Ram's horns in the court;
2702	And who should find them but the empress' villain?
2703	She laugh'd, and told the Moor he should not choose
2704	But give them to his master for a present.
2705	
2706	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, there it goes: God give his lordship joy!
2707	
2708	[Enter a Clown, with a basket, and two pigeons in
2709	it]
2710	
2711	News, news from heaven! Marcus, the post is come.
2712	Sirrah, what tidings? have you any letters?
2713	Shall I have justice? what says Jupiter?
2714	
2715	Clown	O, the gibbet-maker! he says that he hath taken
2716	them down again, for the man must not be hanged till
2717	the next week.
2718	
2719	TITUS ANDRONICUS	But what says Jupiter, I ask thee?
2720	
2721	Clown	Alas, sir, I know not Jupiter; I never drank with him
2722	in all my life.
2723	
2724	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, villain, art not thou the carrier?
2725	
2726	Clown	Ay, of my pigeons, sir; nothing else.
2727	
2728	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, didst thou not come from heaven?
2729	
2730	Clown	From heaven! alas, sir, I never came there     God
2731	forbid I should be so bold to press to heaven in my
2732	young days. Why, I am going with my pigeons to the
2733	tribunal plebs, to take up a matter of brawl
2734	betwixt my uncle and one of the emperial's men.
2735	
2736	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Why, sir, that is as fit as can be to serve for
2737	your oration; and let him deliver the pigeons to
2738	the emperor from you.
2739	
2740	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tell me, can you deliver an oration to the emperor
2741	with a grace?
2742	
2743	Clown	Nay, truly, sir, I could never say grace in all my life.
2744	
2745	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirrah, come hither: make no more ado,
2746	But give your pigeons to the emperor:
2747	By me thou shalt have justice at his hands.
2748	Hold, hold; meanwhile here's money for thy charges.
2749	Give me pen and ink. Sirrah, can you with a grace
2750	deliver a supplication?
2751	
2752	Clown	Ay, sir.
2753	
2754	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Then here is a supplication for you. And when you
2755	come to him, at the first approach you must kneel,
2756	then kiss his foot, then deliver up your pigeons, and
2757	then look for your reward. I'll be at hand, sir; see
2758	you do it bravely.
2759	
2760	Clown	I warrant you, sir, let me alone.
2761	
2762	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Sirrah, hast thou a knife? come, let me see it.
2763	Here, Marcus, fold it in the oration;
2764	For thou hast made it like an humble suppliant.
2765	And when thou hast given it the emperor,
2766	Knock at my door, and tell me what he says.
2767	
2768	Clown	God be with you, sir; I will.
2769	
2770	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, Marcus, let us go. Publius, follow me.

2785	
2786	
2787	[Enter SATURNINUS, TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, CHIRON,
2788	Lords, and others; SATURNINUS with the arrows in
2789	his hand that TITUS shot]
2790	
2791	SATURNINUS	Why, lords, what wrongs are these! was ever seen
2792	An emperor in Rome thus overborne,
2793	Troubled, confronted thus; and, for the extent
2794	Of egal justice, used in such contempt?
2795	My lords, you know, as know the mightful gods,
2796	However these disturbers of our peace
2797	Buz in the people's ears, there nought hath pass'd,
2798	But even with law, against the willful sons
2799	Of old Andronicus. And what an if
2800	His sorrows have so overwhelm'd his wits,
2801	Shall we be thus afflicted in his wreaks,
2802	His fits, his frenzy, and his bitterness?
2803	And now he writes to heaven for his redress:
2804	See, here's to Jove, and this to Mercury;
2805	This to Apollo; this to the god of war;
2806	Sweet scrolls to fly about the streets of Rome!
2807	What's this but libelling against the senate,
2808	And blazoning our injustice every where?
2809	A goodly humour, is it not, my lords?
2810	As who would say, in Rome no justice were.
2811	But if I live, his feigned ecstasies
2812	Shall be no shelter to these outrages:
2813	But he and his shall know that justice lives
2814	In Saturninus' health, whom, if she sleep,
2815	He'll so awake as she in fury shall
2816	Cut off the proud'st conspirator that lives.
2817	
2818	TAMORA	My gracious lord, my lovely Saturnine,
2819	Lord of my life, commander of my thoughts,
2820	Calm thee, and bear the faults of Titus' age,
2821	The effects of sorrow for his valiant sons,
2822	Whose loss hath pierced him deep and scarr'd his heart;
2823	And rather comfort his distressed plight
2824	Than prosecute the meanest or the best
2825	For these contempts.
2826	
2827	[Aside]
2828	
2829	Why, thus it shall become
2830	High-witted Tamora to gloze with all:
2831	But, Titus, I have touched thee to the quick,
2832	Thy life-blood out: if Aaron now be wise,
2833	Then is all safe, the anchor's in the port.
2834	
2835	[Enter Clown]
2836	
2837	How now, good fellow! wouldst thou speak with us?
2838	
2839	Clown	Yea, forsooth, an your mistership be emperial.
2840	
2841	TAMORA	Empress I am, but yonder sits the emperor.
2842	
2843	Clown	'Tis he. God and Saint Stephen give you good den:
2844	I have brought you a letter and a couple of pigeons here.
2845	
2846	[SATURNINUS reads the letter]
2847	
2848	SATURNINUS	Go, take him away, and hang him presently.
2849	
2850	Clown	How much money must I have?
2851	
2852	TAMORA	Come, sirrah, you must be hanged.
2853	
2854	Clown	Hanged! by'r lady, then I have brought up a neck to
2855	a fair end.
2856	
2857	[Exit, guarded]
2858	
2859	SATURNINUS	Despiteful and intolerable wrongs!
2860	Shall I endure this monstrous villany?
2861	I know from whence this same device proceeds:
2862	May this be borne?--as if his traitorous sons,
2863	That died by law for murder of our brother,
2864	Have by my means been butcher'd wrongfully!
2865	Go, drag the villain hither by the hair;
2866	Nor age nor honour shall shape privilege:
2867	For this proud mock I'll be thy slaughterman;
2868	Sly frantic wretch, that holp'st to make me great,
2869	In hope thyself should govern Rome and me.
2870	
2871	[Enter AEMILIUS]
2872	
2873	What news with thee, AEmilius?
2874	
2875	AEMILIUS	Arm, arm, my lord;--Rome never had more cause.
2876	The Goths have gather'd head; and with a power
2877	high-resolved men, bent to the spoil,
2878	They hither march amain, under conduct
2879	Of Lucius, son to old Andronicus;
2880	Who threats, in course of this revenge, to do
2881	As much as ever Coriolanus did.
2882	
2883	SATURNINUS	Is warlike Lucius general of the Goths?
2884	These tidings nip me, and I hang the head
2885	As flowers with frost or grass beat down with storms:
2886	Ay, now begin our sorrows to approach:
2887	'Tis he the common people love so much;
2888	Myself hath often over-heard them say,
2889	When I have walked like a private man,
2890	That Lucius' banishment was wrongfully,
2891	And they have wish'd that Lucius were their emperor.
2892	
2893	TAMORA	Why should you fear? is not your city strong?
2894	
2895	SATURNINUS	Ay, but the citizens favor Lucius,
2896	And will revolt from me to succor him.
2897	
2898	TAMORA	King, be thy thoughts imperious, like thy name.
2899	Is the sun dimm'd, that gnats do fly in it?
2900	The eagle suffers little birds to sing,
2901	And is not careful what they mean thereby,
2902	Knowing that with the shadow of his wings
2903	He can at pleasure stint their melody:
2904	Even so mayst thou the giddy men of Rome.
2905	Then cheer thy spirit : for know, thou emperor,
2906	I will enchant the old Andronicus
2907	With words more sweet, and yet more dangerous,
2908	Than baits to fish, or honey-stalks to sheep,
2909	When as the one is wounded with the bait,
2910	The other rotted with delicious feed.
2911	
2912	SATURNINUS	But he will not entreat his son for us.
2913	
2914	TAMORA	If Tamora entreat him, then he will:
2915	For I can smooth and fill his aged ear
2916	With golden promises; that, were his heart
2917	Almost impregnable, his old ears deaf,
2918	Yet should both ear and heart obey my tongue.
2919	
2920	[To AEmilius]
2921	
2922	Go thou before, be our ambassador:
2923	Say that the emperor requests a parley
2924	Of warlike Lucius, and appoint the meeting
2925	Even at his father's house, the old Andronicus.
2926	
2927	SATURNINUS	AEmilius, do this message honourably:
2928	And if he stand on hostage for his safety,
2929	Bid him demand what pledge will please him best.
2930	
2931	AEMILIUS	Your bidding shall I do effectually.
2932	
2933	[Exit]
2934	
2935	TAMORA	Now will I to that old Andronicus;
2936	And temper him with all the art I have,
2937	To pluck proud Lucius from the warlike Goths.
2938	And now, sweet emperor, be blithe again,
2939	And bury all thy fear in my devices.
2940	
2941	SATURNINUS	Then go successantly, and plead to him.
2942

2953	
2954	
2955	SCENE I	Plains near Rome.
2956	
2957	
2958	[Enter LUCIUS with an army of Goths, with drum and colours]
2959	
2960	LUCIUS	Approved warriors, and my faithful friends,
2961	I have received letters from great Rome,
2962	Which signify what hate they bear their emperor
2963	And how desirous of our sight they are.
2964	Therefore, great lords, be, as your titles witness,
2965	Imperious and impatient of your wrongs,
2966	And wherein Rome hath done you any scath,
2967	Let him make treble satisfaction.
2968	
2969	First Goth	Brave slip, sprung from the great Andronicus,
2970	Whose name was once our terror, now our comfort;
2971	Whose high exploits and honourable deeds
2972	Ingrateful Rome requites with foul contempt,
2973	Be bold in us: we'll follow where thou lead'st,
2974	Like stinging bees in hottest summer's day
2975	Led by their master to the flowered fields,
2976	And be avenged on cursed Tamora.
2977	
2978	All the Goths	And as he saith, so say we all with him.
2979	
2980	LUCIUS	I humbly thank him, and I thank you all.
2981	But who comes here, led by a lusty Goth?
2982	
2983	[Enter a Goth, leading AARON with his Child in his arms]
2984	
2985	Second Goth	Renowned Lucius, from our troops I stray'd
2986	To gaze upon a ruinous monastery;
2987	And, as I earnestly did fix mine eye
2988	Upon the wasted building, suddenly
2989	I heard a child cry underneath a wall.
2990	I made unto the noise; when soon I heard
2991	The crying babe controll'd with this discourse:
2992	'Peace, tawny slave, half me and half thy dam!
2993	Did not thy hue bewray whose brat thou art,
2994	Had nature lent thee but thy mother's look,
2995	Villain, thou mightst have been an emperor:
2996	But where the bull and cow are both milk-white,
2997	They never do beget a coal-black calf.
2998	Peace, villain, peace!'--even thus he rates
2999	the babe,--
3000	'For I must bear thee to a trusty Goth;
3001	Who, when he knows thou art the empress' babe,
3002	Will hold thee dearly for thy mother's sake.'
3003	With this, my weapon drawn, I rush'd upon him,
3004	Surprised him suddenly, and brought him hither,
3005	To use as you think needful of the man.
3006	
3007	LUCIUS	O worthy Goth, this is the incarnate devil
3008	That robb'd Andronicus of his good hand;
3009	This is the pearl that pleased your empress' eye,
3010	And here's the base fruit of his burning lust.
3011	Say, wall-eyed slave, whither wouldst thou convey
3012	This growing image of thy fiend-like face?
3013	Why dost not speak? what, deaf? not a word?
3014	A halter, soldiers! hang him on this tree.
3015	And by his side his fruit of bastardy.
3016	
3017	AARON	Touch not the boy; he is of royal blood.
3018	
3019	LUCIUS	Too like the sire for ever being good.
3020	First hang the child, that he may see it sprawl;
3021	A sight to vex the father's soul withal.
3022	Get me a ladder.
3023	
3024	[A ladder brought, which AARON is made to ascend]
3025	
3026	AARON	                  Lucius, save the child,
3027	And bear it from me to the empress.
3028	If thou do this, I'll show thee wondrous things,
3029	That highly may advantage thee to hear:
3030	If thou wilt not, befall what may befall,
3031	I'll speak no more but 'Vengeance rot you all!'
3032	
3033	LUCIUS	Say on: an if it please me which thou speak'st
3034	Thy child shall live, and I will see it nourish'd.
3035	
3036	AARON	An if it please thee! why, assure thee, Lucius,
3037	'Twill vex thy soul to hear what I shall speak;
3038	For I must talk of murders, rapes and massacres,
3039	Acts of black night, abominable deeds,
3040	Complots of mischief, treason, villanies
3041	Ruthful to hear, yet piteously perform'd:
3042	And this shall all be buried by my death,
3043	Unless thou swear to me my child shall live.
3044	
3045	LUCIUS	Tell on thy mind; I say thy child shall live.
3046	
3047	AARON	Swear that he shall, and then I will begin.
3048	
3049	LUCIUS	Who should I swear by? thou believest no god:
3050	That granted, how canst thou believe an oath?
3051	
3052	AARON	What if I do not? as, indeed, I do not;
3053	Yet, for I know thou art religious
3054	And hast a thing within thee called conscience,
3055	With twenty popish tricks and ceremonies,
3056	Which I have seen thee careful to observe,
3057	Therefore I urge thy oath; for that I know
3058	An idiot holds his bauble for a god
3059	And keeps the oath which by that god he swears,
3060	To that I'll urge him: therefore thou shalt vow
3061	By that same god, what god soe'er it be,
3062	That thou adorest and hast in reverence,
3063	To save my boy, to nourish and bring him up;
3064	Or else I will discover nought to thee.
3065	
3066	LUCIUS	Even by my god I swear to thee I will.
3067	
3068	AARON	First know thou, I begot him on the empress.
3069	
3070	LUCIUS	O most insatiate and luxurious woman!
3071	
3072	AARON	Tut, Lucius, this was but a deed of charity
3073	To that which thou shalt hear of me anon.
3074	'Twas her two sons that murder'd Bassianus;
3075	They cut thy sister's tongue and ravish'd her
3076	And cut her hands and trimm'd her as thou saw'st.
3077	
3078	LUCIUS	O detestable villain! call'st thou that trimming?
3079	
3080	AARON	Why, she was wash'd and cut and trimm'd, and 'twas
3081	Trim sport for them that had the doing of it.
3082	
3083	LUCIUS	O barbarous, beastly villains, like thyself!
3084	
3085	AARON	Indeed, I was their tutor to instruct them:
3086	That codding spirit had they from their mother,
3087	As sure a card as ever won the set;
3088	That bloody mind, I think, they learn'd of me,
3089	As true a dog as ever fought at head.
3090	Well, let my deeds be witness of my worth.
3091	I train'd thy brethren to that guileful hole
3092	Where the dead corpse of Bassianus lay:
3093	I wrote the letter that thy father found
3094	And hid the gold within the letter mention'd,
3095	Confederate with the queen and her two sons:
3096	And what not done, that thou hast cause to rue,
3097	Wherein I had no stroke of mischief in it?
3098	I play'd the cheater for thy father's hand,
3099	And, when I had it, drew myself apart
3100	And almost broke my heart with extreme laughter:
3101	I pry'd me through the crevice of a wall
3102	When, for his hand, he had his two sons' heads;
3103	Beheld his tears, and laugh'd so heartily,
3104	That both mine eyes were rainy like to his :
3105	And when I told the empress of this sport,
3106	She swooned almost at my pleasing tale,
3107	And for my tidings gave me twenty kisses.
3108	
3109	First Goth	What, canst thou say all this, and never blush?
3110	
3111	AARON	Ay, like a black dog, as the saying is.
3112	
3113	LUCIUS	Art thou not sorry for these heinous deeds?
3114	
3115	AARON	Ay, that I had not done a thousand more.
3116	Even now I curse the day--and yet, I think,
3117	Few come within the compass of my curse,--
3118	Wherein I did not some notorious ill,
3119	As kill a man, or else devise his death,
3120	Ravish a maid, or plot the way to do it,
3121	Accuse some innocent and forswear myself,
3122	Set deadly enmity between two friends,
3123	Make poor men's cattle break their necks;
3124	Set fire on barns and hay-stacks in the night,
3125	And bid the owners quench them with their tears.
3126	Oft have I digg'd up dead men from their graves,
3127	And set them upright at their dear friends' doors,
3128	Even when their sorrows almost were forgot;
3129	And on their skins, as on the bark of trees,
3130	Have with my knife carved in Roman letters,
3131	'Let not your sorrow die, though I am dead.'
3132	Tut, I have done a thousand dreadful things
3133	As willingly as one would kill a fly,
3134	And nothing grieves me heartily indeed
3135	But that I cannot do ten thousand more.
3136	
3137	LUCIUS	Bring down the devil; for he must not die
3138	So sweet a death as hanging presently.
3139	
3140	AARON	If there be devils, would I were a devil,
3141	To live and burn in everlasting fire,
3142	So I might have your company in hell,
3143	But to torment you with my bitter tongue!
3144	
3145	LUCIUS	Sirs, stop his mouth, and let him speak no more.
3146	
3147	[Enter a Goth]
3148	
3149	Third Goth	My lord, there is a messenger from Rome
3150	Desires to be admitted to your presence.
3151	
3152	LUCIUS	Let him come near.
3153	
3154	[Enter AEMILIUS]
3155	
3156	Welcome, AEmilius	what's the news from Rome?
3157	
3158	AEMILIUS	Lord Lucius, and you princes of the Goths,
3159	The Roman emperor greets you all by me;
3160	And, for he understands you are in arms,
3161	He craves a parley at your father's house,
3162	Willing you to demand your hostages,
3163	And they shall be immediately deliver'd.
3164	
3165	First Goth	What says our general?
3166	
3167	LUCIUS	AEmilius, let the emperor give his pledges
3168	Unto my father and my uncle Marcus,
3169	And we will come. March away.
3170	
3171	[Exeunt]
3172

3175	
3176	TITUS ANDRONICUS
3177	
3178	
3179	ACT V
3180	
3181	
3182	
3183	SCENE II	Rome. Before TITUS's house.
3184	
3185	
3186	[Enter TAMORA, DEMETRIUS, and CHIRON, disguised]
3187	
3188	TAMORA	Thus, in this strange and sad habiliment,
3189	I will encounter with Andronicus,
3190	And say I am Revenge, sent from below
3191	To join with him and right his heinous wrongs.
3192	Knock at his study, where, they say, he keeps,
3193	To ruminate strange plots of dire revenge;
3194	Tell him Revenge is come to join with him,
3195	And work confusion on his enemies.
3196	
3197	[They knock]
3198	
3199	[Enter TITUS, above]
3200	
3201	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Who doth molest my contemplation?
3202	Is it your trick to make me ope the door,
3203	That so my sad decrees may fly away,
3204	And all my study be to no effect?
3205	You are deceived: for what I mean to do
3206	See here in bloody lines I have set down;
3207	And what is written shall be executed.
3208	
3209	TAMORA	Titus, I am come to talk with thee.
3210	
3211	TITUS ANDRONICUS	No, not a word; how can I grace my talk,
3212	Wanting a hand to give it action?
3213	Thou hast the odds of me; therefore no more.
3214	
3215	TAMORA	If thou didst know me, thou wouldest talk with me.
3216	
3217	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I am not mad; I know thee well enough:
3218	Witness this wretched stump, witness these crimson lines;
3219	Witness these trenches made by grief and care,
3220	Witness the tiring day and heavy night;
3221	Witness all sorrow, that I know thee well
3222	For our proud empress, mighty Tamora:
3223	Is not thy coming for my other hand?
3224	
3225	TAMORA	Know, thou sad man, I am not Tamora;
3226	She is thy enemy, and I thy friend:
3227	I am Revenge: sent from the infernal kingdom,
3228	To ease the gnawing vulture of thy mind,
3229	By working wreakful vengeance on thy foes.
3230	Come down, and welcome me to this world's light;
3231	Confer with me of murder and of death:
3232	There's not a hollow cave or lurking-place,
3233	No vast obscurity or misty vale,
3234	Where bloody murder or detested rape
3235	Can couch for fear, but I will find them out;
3236	And in their ears tell them my dreadful name,
3237	Revenge, which makes the foul offender quake.
3238	
3239	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Art thou Revenge? and art thou sent to me,
3240	To be a torment to mine enemies?
3241	
3242	TAMORA	I am; therefore come down, and welcome me.
3243	
3244	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Do me some service, ere I come to thee.
3245	Lo, by thy side where Rape and Murder stands;
3246	Now give me some surance that thou art Revenge,
3247	Stab them, or tear them on thy chariot-wheels;
3248	And then I'll come and be thy waggoner,
3249	And whirl along with thee about the globe.
3250	Provide thee two proper palfreys, black as jet,
3251	To hale thy vengeful waggon swift away,
3252	And find out murderers in their guilty caves:
3253	And when thy car is loaden with their heads,
3254	I will dismount, and by the waggon-wheel
3255	Trot, like a servile footman, all day long,
3256	Even from Hyperion's rising in the east
3257	Until his very downfall in the sea:
3258	And day by day I'll do this heavy task,
3259	So thou destroy Rapine and Murder there.
3260	
3261	TAMORA	These are my ministers, and come with me.
3262	
3263	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Are these thy ministers? what are they call'd?
3264	
3265	TAMORA	Rapine and Murder; therefore called so,
3266	Cause they take vengeance of such kind of men.
3267	
3268	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Good Lord, how like the empress' sons they are!
3269	And you, the empress! but we worldly men
3270	Have miserable, mad, mistaking eyes.
3271	O sweet Revenge, now do I come to thee;
3272	And, if one arm's embracement will content thee,
3273	I will embrace thee in it by and by.
3274	
3275	[Exit above]
3276	
3277	TAMORA	This closing with him fits his lunacy
3278	Whate'er I forge to feed his brain-sick fits,
3279	Do you uphold and maintain in your speeches,
3280	For now he firmly takes me for Revenge;
3281	And, being credulous in this mad thought,
3282	I'll make him send for Lucius his son;
3283	And, whilst I at a banquet hold him sure,
3284	I'll find some cunning practise out of hand,
3285	To scatter and disperse the giddy Goths,
3286	Or, at the least, make them his enemies.
3287	See, here he comes, and I must ply my theme.
3288	
3289	[Enter TITUS below]
3290	
3291	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Long have I been forlorn, and all for thee:
3292	Welcome, dread Fury, to my woful house:
3293	Rapine and Murder, you are welcome too.
3294	How like the empress and her sons you are!
3295	Well are you fitted, had you but a Moor:
3296	Could not all hell afford you such a devil?
3297	For well I wot the empress never wags
3298	But in her company there is a Moor;
3299	And, would you represent our queen aright,
3300	It were convenient you had such a devil:
3301	But welcome, as you are. What shall we do?
3302	
3303	TAMORA	What wouldst thou have us do, Andronicus?
3304	
3305	DEMETRIUS	Show me a murderer, I'll deal with him.
3306	
3307	CHIRON	Show me a villain that hath done a rape,
3308	And I am sent to be revenged on him.
3309	
3310	TAMORA	Show me a thousand that have done thee wrong,
3311	And I will be revenged on them all.
3312	
3313	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Look round about the wicked streets of Rome;
3314	And when thou find'st a man that's like thyself.
3315	Good Murder, stab him; he's a murderer.
3316	Go thou with him; and when it is thy hap
3317	To find another that is like to thee,
3318	Good Rapine, stab him; he's a ravisher.
3319	Go thou with them; and in the emperor's court
3320	There is a queen, attended by a Moor;
3321	Well mayst thou know her by thy own proportion,
3322	for up and down she doth resemble thee:
3323	I pray thee, do on them some violent death;
3324	They have been violent to me and mine.
3325	
3326	TAMORA	Well hast thou lesson'd us; this shall we do.
3327	But would it please thee, good Andronicus,
3328	To send for Lucius, thy thrice-valiant son,
3329	Who leads towards Rome a band of warlike Goths,
3330	And bid him come and banquet at thy house;
3331	When he is here, even at thy solemn feast,
3332	I will bring in the empress and her sons,
3333	The emperor himself and all thy foes;
3334	And at thy mercy shalt they stoop and kneel,
3335	And on them shalt thou ease thy angry heart.
3336	What says Andronicus to this device?
3337	
3338	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Marcus, my brother! 'tis sad Titus calls.
3339	
3340	[Enter MARCUS]
3341	
3342	Go, gentle Marcus, to thy nephew Lucius;
3343	Thou shalt inquire him out among the Goths:
3344	Bid him repair to me, and bring with him
3345	Some of the chiefest princes of the Goths;
3346	Bid him encamp his soldiers where they are:
3347	Tell him the emperor and the empress too
3348	Feast at my house, and he shall feast with them.
3349	This do thou for my love; and so let him,
3350	As he regards his aged father's life.
3351	
3352	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	This will I do, and soon return again.
3353	
3354	[Exit]
3355	
3356	TAMORA	Now will I hence about thy business,
3357	And take my ministers along with me.
3358	
3359	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Nay, nay, let Rape and Murder stay with me;
3360	Or else I'll call my brother back again,
3361	And cleave to no revenge but Lucius.
3362	
3363	TAMORA	[Aside to her sons]  What say you, boys? will you
3364	bide with him,
3365	Whiles I go tell my lord the emperor
3366	How I have govern'd our determined jest?
3367	Yield to his humour, smooth and speak him fair,
3368	And tarry with him till I turn again.
3369	
3370	TITUS ANDRONICUS	[Aside]  I know them all, though they suppose me mad,
3371	And will o'erreach them in their own devices:
3372	A pair of cursed hell-hounds and their dam!
3373	
3374	DEMETRIUS	Madam, depart at pleasure; leave us here.
3375	
3376	TAMORA	Farewell, Andronicus: Revenge now goes
3377	To lay a complot to betray thy foes.
3378	
3379	TITUS ANDRONICUS	I know thou dost; and, sweet Revenge, farewell.
3380	
3381	[Exit TAMORA]
3382	
3383	CHIRON	Tell us, old man, how shall we be employ'd?
3384	
3385	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Tut, I have work enough for you to do.
3386	Publius, come hither, Caius, and Valentine!
3387	
3388	[Enter PUBLIUS and others]
3389	
3390	PUBLIUS	What is your will?
3391	
3392	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Know you these two?
3393	
3394	PUBLIUS	The empress' sons, I take them, Chiron and Demetrius.
3395	
3396	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Fie, Publius, fie! thou art too much deceived;
3397	The one is Murder, Rape is the other's name;
3398	And therefore bind them, gentle Publius.
3399	Caius and Valentine, lay hands on them.
3400	Oft have you heard me wish for such an hour,
3401	And now I find it; therefore bind them sure,
3402	And stop their mouths, if they begin to cry.
3403	
3404	[Exit]
3405	
3406	[PUBLIUS, &c. lay hold on CHIRON and DEMETRIUS]
3407	
3408	CHIRON	Villains, forbear! we are the empress' sons.
3409	
3410	PUBLIUS	And therefore do we what we are commanded.
3411	Stop close their mouths, let them not speak a word.
3412	Is he sure bound? look that you bind them fast.
3413	
3414	[Re-enter TITUS, with LAVINIA; he bearing a knife,
3415	and she a basin]
3416	
3417	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Come, come, Lavinia; look, thy foes are bound.
3418	Sirs, stop their mouths, let them not speak to me;
3419	But let them hear what fearful words I utter.
3420	O villains, Chiron and Demetrius!
3421	Here stands the spring whom you have stain'd with mud,
3422	This goodly summer with your winter mix'd.
3423	You kill'd her husband, and for that vile fault
3424	Two of her brothers were condemn'd to death,
3425	My hand cut off and made a merry jest;
3426	Both her sweet hands, her tongue, and that more dear
3427	Than hands or tongue, her spotless chastity,
3428	Inhuman traitors, you constrain'd and forced.
3429	What would you say, if I should let you speak?
3430	Villains, for shame you could not beg for grace.
3431	Hark, wretches! how I mean to martyr you.
3432	This one hand yet is left to cut your throats,
3433	Whilst that Lavinia 'tween her stumps doth hold
3434	The basin that receives your guilty blood.
3435	You know your mother means to feast with me,
3436	And calls herself Revenge, and thinks me mad:
3437	Hark, villains! I will grind your bones to dust
3438	And with your blood and it I'll make a paste,
3439	And of the paste a coffin I will rear
3440	And make two pasties of your shameful heads,
3441	And bid that strumpet, your unhallow'd dam,
3442	Like to the earth swallow her own increase.
3443	This is the feast that I have bid her to,
3444	And this the banquet she shall surfeit on;
3445	For worse than Philomel you used my daughter,
3446	And worse than Progne I will be revenged:
3447	And now prepare your throats. Lavinia, come,
3448	
3449	[He cuts their throats]
3450	
3451	Receive the blood: and when that they are dead,
3452	Let me go grind their bones to powder small
3453	And with this hateful liquor temper it;
3454	And in that paste let their vile heads be baked.
3455	Come, come, be every one officious
3456	To make this banquet; which I wish may prove
3457	More stern and bloody than the Centaurs' feast.
3458	So, now bring them in, for I'll play the cook,
3459	And see them ready 'gainst their mother comes.
3460	
3461	[Exeunt, bearing the dead bodies]

3468	
3469	ACT V
3470	
3471	
3472	
3473	SCENE III	Court of TITUS's house. A banquet set out.
3474	
3475	
3476	[Enter LUCIUS, MARCUS, and Goths, with AARON prisoner]
3477	
3478	LUCIUS	Uncle Marcus, since it is my father's mind
3479	That I repair to Rome, I am content.
3480	
3481	First Goth	And ours with thine, befall what fortune will.
3482	
3483	LUCIUS	Good uncle, take you in this barbarous Moor,
3484	This ravenous tiger, this accursed devil;
3485	Let him receive no sustenance, fetter him
3486	Till he be brought unto the empress' face,
3487	For testimony of her foul proceedings:
3488	And see the ambush of our friends be strong;
3489	I fear the emperor means no good to us.
3490	
3491	AARON	Some devil whisper curses in mine ear,
3492	And prompt me, that my tongue may utter forth
3493	The venomous malice of my swelling heart!
3494	
3495	LUCIUS	Away, inhuman dog! unhallow'd slave!
3496	Sirs, help our uncle to convey him in.
3497	
3498	[Exeunt Goths, with AARON. Flourish within]
3499	
3500	The trumpets show the emperor is at hand.
3501	
3502	[Enter SATURNINUS and TAMORA, with AEMILIUS,
3503	Tribunes, Senators, and others]
3504	
3505	SATURNINUS	What, hath the firmament more suns than one?
3506	
3507	LUCIUS	What boots it thee to call thyself a sun?
3508	
3509	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Rome's emperor, and nephew, break the parle;
3510	These quarrels must be quietly debated.
3511	The feast is ready, which the careful Titus
3512	Hath ordain'd to an honourable end,
3513	For peace, for love, for league, and good to Rome:
3514	Please you, therefore, draw nigh, and take your places.
3515	
3516	SATURNINUS	Marcus, we will.
3517	
3518	[Hautboys sound. The Company sit down at table]
3519	
3520	[Enter TITUS dressed like a Cook, LAVINIA veiled,
3521	Young LUCIUS, and others. TITUS places the dishes
3522	on the table]
3523	
3524	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Welcome, my gracious lord; welcome, dread queen;
3525	Welcome, ye warlike Goths; welcome, Lucius;
3526	And welcome, all: although the cheer be poor,
3527	'Twill fill your stomachs; please you eat of it.
3528	
3529	SATURNINUS	Why art thou thus attired, Andronicus?
3530	
3531	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Because I would be sure to have all well,
3532	To entertain your highness and your empress.
3533	
3534	TAMORA	We are beholding to you, good Andronicus.
3535	
3536	TITUS ANDRONICUS	An if your highness knew my heart, you were.
3537	My lord the emperor, resolve me this:
3538	Was it well done of rash Virginius
3539	To slay his daughter with his own right hand,
3540	Because she was enforced, stain'd, and deflower'd?
3541	
3542	SATURNINUS	It was, Andronicus.
3543	
3544	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Your reason, mighty lord?
3545	
3546	SATURNINUS	Because the girl should not survive her shame,
3547	And by her presence still renew his sorrows.
3548	
3549	TITUS ANDRONICUS	A reason mighty, strong, and effectual;
3550	A pattern, precedent, and lively warrant,
3551	For me, most wretched, to perform the like.
3552	Die, die, Lavinia, and thy shame with thee;
3553	
3554	[Kills LAVINIA]
3555	
3556	And, with thy shame, thy father's sorrow die!
3557	
3558	SATURNINUS	What hast thou done, unnatural and unkind?
3559	
3560	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Kill'd her, for whom my tears have made me blind.
3561	I am as woful as Virginius was,
3562	And have a thousand times more cause than he
3563	To do this outrage: and it now is done.
3564	
3565	SATURNINUS	What, was she ravish'd? tell who did the deed.
3566	
3567	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Will't please you eat? will't please your
3568	highness feed?
3569	
3570	TAMORA	Why hast thou slain thine only daughter thus?
3571	
3572	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Not I; 'twas Chiron and Demetrius:
3573	They ravish'd her, and cut away her tongue;
3574	And they, 'twas they, that did her all this wrong.
3575	
3576	SATURNINUS	Go fetch them hither to us presently.
3577	
3578	TITUS ANDRONICUS	Why, there they are both, baked in that pie;
3579	Whereof their mother daintily hath fed,
3580	Eating the flesh that she herself hath bred.
3581	'Tis true, 'tis true; witness my knife's sharp point.
3582	
3583	[Kills TAMORA]
3584	
3585	SATURNINUS	Die, frantic wretch, for this accursed deed!
3586	
3587	[Kills TITUS]
3588	
3589	LUCIUS	Can the son's eye behold his father bleed?
3590	There's meed for meed, death for a deadly deed!
3591	
3592	[Kills SATURNINUS. A great tumult. LUCIUS, MARCUS,
3593	and others go up into the balcony]
3594	
3595	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	You sad-faced men, people and sons of Rome,
3596	By uproar sever'd, like a flight of fowl
3597	Scatter'd by winds and high tempestuous gusts,
3598	O, let me teach you how to knit again
3599	This scatter'd corn into one mutual sheaf,
3600	These broken limbs again into one body;
3601	Lest Rome herself be bane unto herself,
3602	And she whom mighty kingdoms court'sy to,
3603	Like a forlorn and desperate castaway,
3604	Do shameful execution on herself.
3605	But if my frosty signs and chaps of age,
3606	Grave witnesses of true experience,
3607	Cannot induce you to attend my words,
3608	
3609	[To LUCIUS]
3610	
3611	Speak, Rome's dear friend, as erst our ancestor,
3612	When with his solemn tongue he did discourse
3613	To love-sick Dido's sad attending ear
3614	The story of that baleful burning night
3615	When subtle Greeks surprised King Priam's Troy,
3616	Tell us what Sinon hath bewitch'd our ears,
3617	Or who hath brought the fatal engine in
3618	That gives our Troy, our Rome, the civil wound.
3619	My heart is not compact of flint nor steel;
3620	Nor can I utter all our bitter grief,
3621	But floods of tears will drown my oratory,
3622	And break my utterance, even in the time
3623	When it should move you to attend me most,
3624	Lending your kind commiseration.
3625	Here is a captain, let him tell the tale;
3626	Your hearts will throb and weep to hear him speak.
3627	
3628	LUCIUS	Then, noble auditory, be it known to you,
3629	That cursed Chiron and Demetrius
3630	Were they that murdered our emperor's brother;
3631	And they it were that ravished our sister:
3632	For their fell faults our brothers were beheaded;
3633	Our father's tears despised, and basely cozen'd
3634	Of that true hand that fought Rome's quarrel out,
3635	And sent her enemies unto the grave.
3636	Lastly, myself unkindly banished,
3637	The gates shut on me, and turn'd weeping out,
3638	To beg relief among Rome's enemies:
3639	Who drown'd their enmity in my true tears.
3640	And oped their arms to embrace me as a friend.
3641	I am the turned forth, be it known to you,
3642	That have preserved her welfare in my blood;
3643	And from her bosom took the enemy's point,
3644	Sheathing the steel in my adventurous body.
3645	Alas, you know I am no vaunter, I;
3646	My scars can witness, dumb although they are,
3647	That my report is just and full of truth.
3648	But, soft! methinks I do digress too much,
3649	Citing my worthless praise: O, pardon me;
3650	For when no friends are by, men praise themselves.
3651	
3652	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Now is my turn to speak. Behold this child:
3653	
3654	[Pointing to the Child in the arms of an Attendant]
3655	
3656	Of this was Tamora delivered;
3657	The issue of an irreligious Moor,
3658	Chief architect and plotter of these woes:
3659	The villain is alive in Titus' house,
3660	And as he is, to witness this is true.
3661	Now judge what cause had Titus to revenge
3662	These wrongs, unspeakable, past patience,
3663	Or more than any living man could bear.
3664	Now you have heard the truth, what say you, Romans?
3665	Have we done aught amiss,--show us wherein,
3666	And, from the place where you behold us now,
3667	The poor remainder of Andronici
3668	Will, hand in hand, all headlong cast us down.
3669	And on the ragged stones beat forth our brains,
3670	And make a mutual closure of our house.
3671	Speak, Romans, speak; and if you say we shall,
3672	Lo, hand in hand, Lucius and I will fall.
3673	
3674	AEMILIUS	Come, come, thou reverend man of Rome,
3675	And bring our emperor gently in thy hand,
3676	Lucius our emperor; for well I know
3677	The common voice do cry it shall be so.
3678	
3679	All	Lucius, all hail, Rome's royal emperor!
3680	
3681	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Go, go into old Titus' sorrowful house,
3682	
3683	[To Attendants]
3684	
3685	And hither hale that misbelieving Moor,
3686	To be adjudged some direful slaughtering death,
3687	As punishment for his most wicked life.
3688	
3689	[Exeunt Attendants]
3690	
3691	[LUCIUS, MARCUS, and the others descend]
3692	
3693	All	Lucius, all hail, Rome's gracious governor!
3694	
3695	LUCIUS	Thanks, gentle Romans: may I govern so,
3696	To heal Rome's harms, and wipe away her woe!
3697	But, gentle people, give me aim awhile,
3698	For nature puts me to a heavy task:
3699	Stand all aloof: but, uncle, draw you near,
3700	To shed obsequious tears upon this trunk.
3701	O, take this warm kiss on thy pale cold lips,
3702	
3703	[Kissing TITUS]
3704	
3705	These sorrowful drops upon thy blood-stain'd face,
3706	The last true duties of thy noble son!
3707	
3708	MARCUS ANDRONICUS	Tear for tear, and loving kiss for kiss,
3709	Thy brother Marcus tenders on thy lips:
3710	O were the sum of these that I should pay
3711	Countless and infinite, yet would I pay them!
3712	
3713	LUCIUS	Come hither, boy; come, come, and learn of us
3714	To melt in showers: thy grandsire loved thee well:
3715	Many a time he danced thee on his knee,
3716	Sung thee asleep, his loving breast thy pillow:
3717	Many a matter hath he told to thee,
3718	Meet and agreeing with thine infancy;
3719	In that respect, then, like a loving child,
3720	Shed yet some small drops from thy tender spring,
3721	Because kind nature doth require it so:
3722	Friends should associate friends in grief and woe:
3723	Bid him farewell; commit him to the grave;
3724	Do him that kindness, and take leave of him.
3725	
3726	Young LUCIUS	O grandsire, grandsire! even with all my heart
3727	Would I were dead, so you did live again!
3728	O Lord, I cannot speak to him for weeping;
3729	My tears will choke me, if I ope my mouth.
3730	
3731	[Re-enter Attendants with AARON]
3732	
3733	AEMILIUS	You sad Andronici, have done with woes:
3734	Give sentence on this execrable wretch,
3735	That hath been breeder of these dire events.
3736	
3737	LUCIUS	Set him breast-deep in earth, and famish him;
3738	There let him stand, and rave, and cry for food;
3739	If any one relieves or pities him,
3740	For the offence he dies. This is our doom:
3741	Some stay to see him fasten'd in the earth.
3742	
3743	AARON	O, why should wrath be mute, and fury dumb?
3744	I am no baby, I, that with base prayers
3745	I should repent the evils I have done:
3746	Ten thousand worse than ever yet I did
3747	Would I perform, if I might have my will;
3748	If one good deed in all my life I did,
3749	I do repent it from my very soul.
3750	
3751	LUCIUS	Some loving friends convey the emperor hence,
3752	And give him burial in his father's grave:
3753	My father and Lavinia shall forthwith
3754	Be closed in our household's monument.
3755	As for that heinous tiger, Tamora,
3756	No funeral rite, nor man m mourning weeds,
3757	No mournful bell shall ring her burial;
3758	But throw her forth to beasts and birds of prey:
3759	Her life was beast-like, and devoid of pity;
3760	And, being so, shall have like want of pity.
3761	See justice done on Aaron, that damn'd Moor,
3762	By whom our heavy haps had their beginning:
3763	Then, afterwards, to order well the state,
3764	That like events may ne'er it ruinate.
3765	
3766	[Exeunt]

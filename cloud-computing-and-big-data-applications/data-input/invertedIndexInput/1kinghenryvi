116	ACT I
117	
118	
119	
120	SCENE I	Westminster Abbey.
121	
122	
123	[Dead March. Enter the Funeral of KING HENRY the
124	Fifth, attended on by Dukes of BEDFORD, Regent of
125	France; GLOUCESTER, Protector; and EXETER, Earl of
126	WARWICK, the BISHOP OF WINCHESTER, Heralds, &c]
127	
128	BEDFORD	Hung be the heavens with black, yield day to night!
129	Comets, importing change of times and states,
130	Brandish your crystal tresses in the sky,
131	And with them scourge the bad revolting stars
132	That have consented unto Henry's death!
133	King Henry the Fifth, too famous to live long!
134	England ne'er lost a king of so much worth.
135	
136	GLOUCESTER	England ne'er had a king until his time.
137	Virtue he had, deserving to command:
138	His brandish'd sword did blind men with his beams:
139	His arms spread wider than a dragon's wings;
140	His sparking eyes, replete with wrathful fire,
141	More dazzled and drove back his enemies
142	Than mid-day sun fierce bent against their faces.
143	What should I say? his deeds exceed all speech:
144	He ne'er lift up his hand but conquered.
145	
146	EXETER	We mourn in black: why mourn we not in blood?
147	Henry is dead and never shall revive:
148	Upon a wooden coffin we attend,
149	And death's dishonourable victory
150	We with our stately presence glorify,
151	Like captives bound to a triumphant car.
152	What! shall we curse the planets of mishap
153	That plotted thus our glory's overthrow?
154	Or shall we think the subtle-witted French
155	Conjurers and sorcerers, that afraid of him
156	By magic verses have contrived his end?
157	
158	BISHOP
159	OF WINCHESTER	He was a king bless'd of the King of kings.
160	Unto the French the dreadful judgement-day
161	So dreadful will not be as was his sight.
162	The battles of the Lord of hosts he fought:
163	The church's prayers made him so prosperous.
164	
165	GLOUCESTER	The church! where is it? Had not churchmen pray'd,
166	His thread of life had not so soon decay'd:
167	None do you like but an effeminate prince,
168	Whom, like a school-boy, you may over-awe.
169	
170	BISHOP
171	OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, whate'er we like, thou art protector
172	And lookest to command the prince and realm.
173	Thy wife is proud; she holdeth thee in awe,
174	More than God or religious churchmen may.
175	
176	GLOUCESTER	Name not religion, for thou lovest the flesh,
177	And ne'er throughout the year to church thou go'st
178	Except it be to pray against thy foes.
179	
180	BEDFORD	Cease, cease these jars and rest your minds in peace:
181	Let's to the altar: heralds, wait on us:
182	Instead of gold, we'll offer up our arms:
183	Since arms avail not now that Henry's dead.
184	Posterity, await for wretched years,
185	When at their mothers' moist eyes babes shall suck,
186	Our isle be made a nourish of salt tears,
187	And none but women left to wail the dead.
188	Henry the Fifth, thy ghost I invocate:
189	Prosper this realm, keep it from civil broils,
190	Combat with adverse planets in the heavens!
191	A far more glorious star thy soul will make
192	Than Julius Caesar or bright--
193	
194	[Enter a Messenger]
195	
196	Messenger	My honourable lords, health to you all!
197	Sad tidings bring I to you out of France,
198	Of loss, of slaughter and discomfiture:
199	Guienne, Champagne, Rheims, Orleans,
200	Paris, Guysors, Poictiers, are all quite lost.
201	
202	BEDFORD	What say'st thou, man, before dead Henry's corse?
203	Speak softly, or the loss of those great towns
204	Will make him burst his lead and rise from death.
205	
206	GLOUCESTER	Is Paris lost? is Rouen yielded up?
207	If Henry were recall'd to life again,
208	These news would cause him once more yield the ghost.
209	
210	EXETER	How were they lost? what treachery was used?
211	
212	Messenger	No treachery; but want of men and money.
213	Amongst the soldiers this is muttered,
214	That here you maintain several factions,
215	And whilst a field should be dispatch'd and fought,
216	You are disputing of your generals:
217	One would have lingering wars with little cost;
218	Another would fly swift, but wanteth wings;
219	A third thinks, without expense at all,
220	By guileful fair words peace may be obtain'd.
221	Awake, awake, English nobility!
222	Let not sloth dim your horrors new-begot:
223	Cropp'd are the flower-de-luces in your arms;
224	Of England's coat one half is cut away.
225	
226	EXETER	Were our tears wanting to this funeral,
227	These tidings would call forth their flowing tides.
228	
229	BEDFORD	Me they concern; Regent I am of France.
230	Give me my steeled coat. I'll fight for France.
231	Away with these disgraceful wailing robes!
232	Wounds will I lend the French instead of eyes,
233	To weep their intermissive miseries.
234	
235	[Enter to them another Messenger]
236	
237	Messenger	Lords, view these letters full of bad mischance.
238	France is revolted from the English quite,
239	Except some petty towns of no import:
240	The Dauphin Charles is crowned king of Rheims;
241	The Bastard of Orleans with him is join'd;
242	Reignier, Duke of Anjou, doth take his part;
243	The Duke of Alencon flieth to his side.
244	
245	EXETER	The Dauphin crowned king! all fly to him!
246	O, whither shall we fly from this reproach?
247	
248	GLOUCESTER	We will not fly, but to our enemies' throats.
249	Bedford, if thou be slack, I'll fight it out.
250	
251	BEDFORD	Gloucester, why doubt'st thou of my forwardness?
252	An army have I muster'd in my thoughts,
253	Wherewith already France is overrun.
254	
255	[Enter another Messenger]
256	
257	Messenger	My gracious lords, to add to your laments,
258	Wherewith you now bedew King Henry's hearse,
259	I must inform you of a dismal fight
260	Betwixt the stout Lord Talbot and the French.
261	
262	BISHOP
263	OF WINCHESTER	What! wherein Talbot overcame? is't so?
264	
265	Messenger	O, no; wherein Lord Talbot was o'erthrown:
266	The circumstance I'll tell you more at large.
267	The tenth of August last this dreadful lord,
268	Retiring from the siege of Orleans,
269	Having full scarce six thousand in his troop.
270	By three and twenty thousand of the French
271	Was round encompassed and set upon.
272	No leisure had he to enrank his men;
273	He wanted pikes to set before his archers;
274	Instead whereof sharp stakes pluck'd out of hedges
275	They pitched in the ground confusedly,
276	To keep the horsemen off from breaking in.
277	More than three hours the fight continued;
278	Where valiant Talbot above human thought
279	Enacted wonders with his sword and lance:
280	Hundreds he sent to hell, and none durst stand him;
281	Here, there, and every where, enraged he flew:
282	The French exclaim'd, the devil was in arms;
283	All the whole army stood agazed on him:
284	His soldiers spying his undaunted spirit
285	A Talbot! a Talbot! cried out amain
286	And rush'd into the bowels of the battle.
287	Here had the conquest fully been seal'd up,
288	If Sir John Fastolfe had not play'd the coward:
289	He, being in the vaward, placed behind
290	With purpose to relieve and follow them,
291	Cowardly fled, not having struck one stroke.
292	Hence grew the general wreck and massacre;
293	Enclosed were they with their enemies:
294	A base Walloon, to win the Dauphin's grace,
295	Thrust Talbot with a spear into the back,
296	Whom all France with their chief assembled strength
297	Durst not presume to look once in the face.
298	
299	BEDFORD	Is Talbot slain? then I will slay myself,
300	For living idly here in pomp and ease,
301	Whilst such a worthy leader, wanting aid,
302	Unto his dastard foemen is betray'd.
303	
304	Messenger	O no, he lives; but is took prisoner,
305	And Lord Scales with him and Lord Hungerford:
306	Most of the rest slaughter'd or took likewise.
307	
308	BEDFORD	His ransom there is none but I shall pay:
309	I'll hale the Dauphin headlong from his throne:
310	His crown shall be the ransom of my friend;
311	Four of their lords I'll change for one of ours.
312	Farewell, my masters; to my task will I;
313	Bonfires in France forthwith I am to make,
314	To keep our great Saint George's feast withal:
315	Ten thousand soldiers with me I will take,
316	Whose bloody deeds shall make all Europe quake.
317	
318	Messenger	So you had need; for Orleans is besieged;
319	The English army is grown weak and faint:
320	The Earl of Salisbury craveth supply,
321	And hardly keeps his men from mutiny,
322	Since they, so few, watch such a multitude.
323	
324	EXETER	Remember, lords, your oaths to Henry sworn,
325	Either to quell the Dauphin utterly,
326	Or bring him in obedience to your yoke.
327	
328	BEDFORD	I do remember it; and here take my leave,
329	To go about my preparation.
330	
331	[Exit]
332	
333	GLOUCESTER	I'll to the Tower with all the haste I can,
334	To view the artillery and munition;
335	And then I will proclaim young Henry king.
336	
337	[Exit]
338	
339	EXETER	To Eltham will I, where the young king is,
340	Being ordain'd his special governor,
341	And for his safety there I'll best devise.
342	
343	[Exit]
344	
345	BISHOP
346	OF WINCHESTER	Each hath his place and function to attend:
347	I am left out; for me nothing remains.
348	But long I will not be Jack out of office:
349	The king from Eltham I intend to steal
350	And sit at chiefest stern of public weal.
351	
352	[Exeunt]
353	
354

357	1 KING HENRY VI
358	
359	
360	ACT I
361	
362	
363	
364	SCENE II	France. Before Orleans.
365	
366	
367	[Sound a flourish. Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and
368	REIGNIER, marching with drum and Soldiers]
369	
370	CHARLES	Mars his true moving, even as in the heavens
371	So in the earth, to this day is not known:
372	Late did he shine upon the English side;
373	Now we are victors; upon us he smiles.
374	What towns of any moment but we have?
375	At pleasure here we lie near Orleans;
376	Otherwhiles the famish'd English, like pale ghosts,
377	Faintly besiege us one hour in a month.
378	
379	ALENCON	They want their porridge and their fat bull-beeves:
380	Either they must be dieted like mules
381	And have their provender tied to their mouths
382	Or piteous they will look, like drowned mice.
383	
384	REIGNIER	Let's raise the siege: why live we idly here?
385	Talbot is taken, whom we wont to fear:
386	Remaineth none but mad-brain'd Salisbury;
387	And he may well in fretting spend his gall,
388	Nor men nor money hath he to make war.
389	
390	CHARLES	Sound, sound alarum! we will rush on them.
391	Now for the honour of the forlorn French!
392	Him I forgive my death that killeth me
393	When he sees me go back one foot or fly.
394	
395	[Exeunt]
396	
397	[Here alarum; they are beaten back by the English
398	with great loss. Re-enter CHARLES, ALENCON, and REIGNIER]
399	
400	CHARLES	Who ever saw the like? what men have I!
401	Dogs! cowards! dastards! I would ne'er have fled,
402	But that they left me 'midst my enemies.
403	
404	REIGNIER	Salisbury is a desperate homicide;
405	He fighteth as one weary of his life.
406	The other lords, like lions wanting food,
407	Do rush upon us as their hungry prey.
408	
409	ALENCON	Froissart, a countryman of ours, records,
410	England all Olivers and Rowlands bred,
411	During the time Edward the Third did reign.
412	More truly now may this be verified;
413	For none but Samsons and Goliases
414	It sendeth forth to skirmish. One to ten!
415	Lean, raw-boned rascals! who would e'er suppose
416	They had such courage and audacity?
417	
418	CHARLES	Let's leave this town; for they are hare-brain'd slaves,
419	And hunger will enforce them to be more eager:
420	Of old I know them; rather with their teeth
421	The walls they'll tear down than forsake the siege.
422	
423	REIGNIER	I think, by some odd gimmors or device
424	Their arms are set like clocks, stiff to strike on;
425	Else ne'er could they hold out so as they do.
426	By my consent, we'll even let them alone.
427	
428	ALENCON	Be it so.
429	
430	[Enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS]
431	
432	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Where's the Prince Dauphin? I have news for him.
433	
434	CHARLES	Bastard of Orleans, thrice welcome to us.
435	
436	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Methinks your looks are sad, your cheer appall'd:
437	Hath the late overthrow wrought this offence?
438	Be not dismay'd, for succor is at hand:
439	A holy maid hither with me I bring,
440	Which by a vision sent to her from heaven
441	Ordained is to raise this tedious siege
442	And drive the English forth the bounds of France.
443	The spirit of deep prophecy she hath,
444	Exceeding the nine sibyls of old Rome:
445	What's past and what's to come she can descry.
446	Speak, shall I call her in? Believe my words,
447	For they are certain and unfallible.
448	
449	CHARLES	Go, call her in.
450	
451	[Exit BASTARD OF ORLEANS]
452	
453	But first, to try her skill,
454	Reignier, stand thou as Dauphin in my place:
455	Question her proudly; let thy looks be stern:
456	By this means shall we sound what skill she hath.
457	
458	[Re-enter the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, with JOAN LA PUCELLE]
459	
460	REIGNIER	Fair maid, is't thou wilt do these wondrous feats?
461	
462	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Reignier, is't thou that thinkest to beguile me?
463	Where is the Dauphin? Come, come from behind;
464	I know thee well, though never seen before.
465	Be not amazed, there's nothing hid from me:
466	In private will I talk with thee apart.
467	Stand back, you lords, and give us leave awhile.
468	
469	REIGNIER	She takes upon her bravely at first dash.
470	
471	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Dauphin, I am by birth a shepherd's daughter,
472	My wit untrain'd in any kind of art.
473	Heaven and our Lady gracious hath it pleased
474	To shine on my contemptible estate:
475	Lo, whilst I waited on my tender lambs,
476	And to sun's parching heat display'd my cheeks,
477	God's mother deigned to appear to me
478	And in a vision full of majesty
479	Will'd me to leave my base vocation
480	And free my country from calamity:
481	Her aid she promised and assured success:
482	In complete glory she reveal'd herself;
483	And, whereas I was black and swart before,
484	With those clear rays which she infused on me
485	That beauty am I bless'd with which you see.
486	Ask me what question thou canst possible,
487	And I will answer unpremeditated:
488	My courage try by combat, if thou darest,
489	And thou shalt find that I exceed my sex.
490	Resolve on this, thou shalt be fortunate,
491	If thou receive me for thy warlike mate.
492	
493	CHARLES	Thou hast astonish'd me with thy high terms:
494	Only this proof I'll of thy valour make,
495	In single combat thou shalt buckle with me,
496	And if thou vanquishest, thy words are true;
497	Otherwise I renounce all confidence.
498	
499	JOAN LA PUCELLE	I am prepared: here is my keen-edged sword,
500	Deck'd with five flower-de-luces on each side;
501	The which at Touraine, in Saint Katharine's
502	churchyard,
503	Out of a great deal of old iron I chose forth.
504	
505	CHARLES	Then come, o' God's name; I fear no woman.
506	
507	JOAN LA PUCELLE	And while I live, I'll ne'er fly from a man.
508	
509	[Here they fight, and JOAN LA PUCELLE overcomes]
510	
511	CHARLES	Stay, stay thy hands! thou art an Amazon
512	And fightest with the sword of Deborah.
513	
514	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Christ's mother helps me, else I were too weak.
515	
516	CHARLES	Whoe'er helps thee, 'tis thou that must help me:
517	Impatiently I burn with thy desire;
518	My heart and hands thou hast at once subdued.
519	Excellent Pucelle, if thy name be so,
520	Let me thy servant and not sovereign be:
521	'Tis the French Dauphin sueth to thee thus.
522	
523	JOAN LA PUCELLE	I must not yield to any rites of love,
524	For my profession's sacred from above:
525	When I have chased all thy foes from hence,
526	Then will I think upon a recompense.
527	
528	CHARLES	Meantime look gracious on thy prostrate thrall.
529	
530	REIGNIER	My lord, methinks, is very long in talk.
531	
532	ALENCON	Doubtless he shrives this woman to her smock;
533	Else ne'er could he so long protract his speech.
534	
535	REIGNIER	Shall we disturb him, since he keeps no mean?
536	
537	ALENCON	He may mean more than we poor men do know:
538	These women are shrewd tempters with their tongues.
539	
540	REIGNIER	My lord, where are you? what devise you on?
541	Shall we give over Orleans, or no?
542	
543	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Why, no, I say, distrustful recreants!
544	Fight till the last gasp; I will be your guard.
545	
546	CHARLES	What she says I'll confirm: we'll fight it out.
547	
548	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Assign'd am I to be the English scourge.
549	This night the siege assuredly I'll raise:
550	Expect Saint Martin's summer, halcyon days,
551	Since I have entered into these wars.
552	Glory is like a circle in the water,
553	Which never ceaseth to enlarge itself
554	Till by broad spreading it disperse to nought.
555	With Henry's death the English circle ends;
556	Dispersed are the glories it included.
557	Now am I like that proud insulting ship
558	Which Caesar and his fortune bare at once.
559	
560	CHARLES	Was Mahomet inspired with a dove?
561	Thou with an eagle art inspired then.
562	Helen, the mother of great Constantine,
563	Nor yet Saint Philip's daughters, were like thee.
564	Bright star of Venus, fall'n down on the earth,
565	How may I reverently worship thee enough?
566	
567	ALENCON	Leave off delays, and let us raise the siege.
568	
569	REIGNIER	Woman, do what thou canst to save our honours;
570	Drive them from Orleans and be immortalized.
571	
572	CHARLES	Presently we'll try: come, let's away about it:
573	No prophet will I trust, if she prove false.

580	1 KING HENRY VI
581	
582	
583	ACT I
584	
585	
586	
587	SCENE III	London. Before the Tower.
588	
589	
590	[Enter GLOUCESTER, with his Serving-men in blue coats]
591	
592	GLOUCESTER	I am come to survey the Tower this day:
593	Since Henry's death, I fear, there is conveyance.
594	Where be these warders, that they wait not here?
595	Open the gates; 'tis Gloucester that calls.
596	
597	First Warder	[Within]  Who's there that knocks so imperiously?
598	
599	First Serving-Man	It is the noble Duke of Gloucester.
600	
601	Second Warder	[Within]  Whoe'er he be, you may not be let in.
602	
603	First Serving-Man	Villains, answer you so the lord protector?
604	
605	First Warder	[Within]  The Lord protect him! so we answer him:
606	We do no otherwise than we are will'd.
607	
608	GLOUCESTER	Who willed you? or whose will stands but mine?
609	There's none protector of the realm but I.
610	Break up the gates, I'll be your warrantize.
611	Shall I be flouted thus by dunghill grooms?
612	
613	[Gloucester's men rush at the Tower Gates, and
614	WOODVILE the Lieutenant speaks within]
615	
616	WOODVILE	What noise is this? what traitors have we here?
617	
618	GLOUCESTER	Lieutenant, is it you whose voice I hear?
619	Open the gates; here's Gloucester that would enter.
620	
621	WOODVILE	Have patience, noble duke; I may not open;
622	The Cardinal of Winchester forbids:
623	From him I have express commandment
624	That thou nor none of thine shall be let in.
625	
626	GLOUCESTER	Faint-hearted Woodvile, prizest him 'fore me?
627	Arrogant Winchester, that haughty prelate,
628	Whom Henry, our late sovereign, ne'er could brook?
629	Thou art no friend to God or to the king:
630	Open the gates, or I'll shut thee out shortly.
631	
632	Serving-Men	Open the gates unto the lord protector,
633	Or we'll burst them open, if that you come not quickly.
634	
635	[Enter to the Protector at the Tower Gates BISHOP
636	OF WINCHESTER and his men in tawny coats]
637	
638	BISHOP
639	OF WINCHESTER	How now, ambitious Humphry! what means this?
640	
641	GLOUCESTER	Peel'd priest, dost thou command me to be shut out?
642	
643	BISHOP
644	OF WINCHESTER	I do, thou most usurping proditor,
645	And not protector, of the king or realm.
646	
647	GLOUCESTER	Stand back, thou manifest conspirator,
648	Thou that contrivedst to murder our dead lord;
649	Thou that givest whores indulgences to sin:
650	I'll canvass thee in thy broad cardinal's hat,
651	If thou proceed in this thy insolence.
652	
653	BISHOP
654	OF WINCHESTER	Nay, stand thou back, I will not budge a foot:
655	This be Damascus, be thou cursed Cain,
656	To slay thy brother Abel, if thou wilt.
657	
658	GLOUCESTER	I will not slay thee, but I'll drive thee back:
659	Thy scarlet robes as a child's bearing-cloth
660	I'll use to carry thee out of this place.
661	
662	BISHOP
663	OF WINCHESTER	Do what thou darest; I beard thee to thy face.
664	
665	GLOUCESTER	What! am I dared and bearded to my face?
666	Draw, men, for all this privileged place;
667	Blue coats to tawny coats. Priest, beware your beard,
668	I mean to tug it and to cuff you soundly:
669	Under my feet I stamp thy cardinal's hat:
670	In spite of pope or dignities of church,
671	Here by the cheeks I'll drag thee up and down.
672	
673	BISHOP
674	OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, thou wilt answer this before the pope.
675	
676	GLOUCESTER	Winchester goose, I cry, a rope! a rope!
677	Now beat them hence; why do you let them stay?
678	Thee I'll chase hence, thou wolf in sheep's array.
679	Out, tawny coats! out, scarlet hypocrite!
680	
681	[Here GLOUCESTER's men beat out BISHOP OF
682	WINCHESTER's men, and enter in the hurly-
683	burly the Mayor of London and his Officers]
684	
685	Mayor	Fie, lords! that you, being supreme magistrates,
686	Thus contumeliously should break the peace!
687	
688	GLOUCESTER	Peace, mayor! thou know'st little of my wrongs:
689	Here's Beaufort, that regards nor God nor king,
690	Hath here distrain'd the Tower to his use.
691	
692	BISHOP
693	OF WINCHESTER	Here's Gloucester, a foe to citizens,
694	One that still motions war and never peace,
695	O'ercharging your free purses with large fines,
696	That seeks to overthrow religion,
697	Because he is protector of the realm,
698	And would have armour here out of the Tower,
699	To crown himself king and suppress the prince.
700	
701	GLOUCESTER	I will not answer thee with words, but blows.
702	
703	[Here they skirmish again]
704	
705	Mayor	Naught rests for me in this tumultuous strife
706	But to make open proclamation:
707	Come, officer; as loud as e'er thou canst,
708	Cry.
709	
710	Officer	All manner of men assembled here in arms this day
711	against God's peace and the king's, we charge and
712	command you, in his highness' name, to repair to
713	your several dwelling-places; and not to wear,
714	handle, or use any sword, weapon, or dagger,
715	henceforward, upon pain of death.
716	
717	GLOUCESTER	Cardinal, I'll be no breaker of the law:
718	But we shall meet, and break our minds at large.
719	
720	BISHOP
721	OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, we will meet; to thy cost, be sure:
722	Thy heart-blood I will have for this day's work.
723	
724	Mayor	I'll call for clubs, if you will not away.
725	This cardinal's more haughty than the devil.
726	
727	GLOUCESTER	Mayor, farewell: thou dost but what thou mayst.
728	
729	BISHOP
730	OF WINCHESTER	Abominable Gloucester, guard thy head;
731	For I intend to have it ere long.
732	
733	[Exeunt, severally, GLOUCESTER and BISHOP OF
734	WINCHESTER with their Serving-men]
735	
736	Mayor	See the coast clear'd, and then we will depart.
737	Good God, these nobles should such stomachs bear!
738	I myself fight not once in forty year.

752	SCENE IV	Orleans.
753	
754	
755	[Enter, on the walls, a Master Gunner and his Boy]
756	
757	Master-Gunner	Sirrah, thou know'st how Orleans is besieged,
758	And how the English have the suburbs won.
759	
760	Boy	Father, I know; and oft have shot at them,
761	Howe'er unfortunate I miss'd my aim.
762	
763	Master-Gunner	But now thou shalt not. Be thou ruled by me:
764	Chief master-gunner am I of this town;
765	Something I must do to procure me grace.
766	The prince's espials have informed me
767	How the English, in the suburbs close intrench'd,
768	Wont, through a secret grate of iron bars
769	In yonder tower, to overpeer the city,
770	And thence discover how with most advantage
771	They may vex us with shot, or with assault.
772	To intercept this inconvenience,
773	A piece of ordnance 'gainst it I have placed;
774	And even these three days have I watch'd,
775	If I could see them.
776	Now do thou watch, for I can stay no longer.
777	If thou spy'st any, run and bring me word;
778	And thou shalt find me at the governor's.
779	
780	[Exit]
781	
782	Boy	Father, I warrant you; take you no care;
783	I'll never trouble you, if I may spy them.
784	
785	[Exit]
786	
787	[Enter, on the turrets, SALISBURY and TALBOT,
788	GLANSDALE, GARGRAVE, and others]
789	
790	SALISBURY	Talbot, my life, my joy, again return'd!
791	How wert thou handled being prisoner?
792	Or by what means got'st thou to be released?
793	Discourse, I prithee, on this turret's top.
794	
795	TALBOT	The Duke of Bedford had a prisoner
796	Call'd the brave Lord Ponton de Santrailles;
797	For him was I exchanged and ransomed.
798	But with a baser man of arms by far
799	Once in contempt they would have barter'd me:
800	Which I, disdaining, scorn'd; and craved death,
801	Rather than I would be so vile esteem'd.
802	In fine, redeem'd I was as I desired.
803	But, O! the treacherous Fastolfe wounds my heart,
804	Whom with my bare fists I would execute,
805	If I now had him brought into my power.
806	
807	SALISBURY	Yet tell'st thou not how thou wert entertain'd.
808	
809	TALBOT	With scoffs and scorns and contumelious taunts.
810	In open market-place produced they me,
811	To be a public spectacle to all:
812	Here, said they, is the terror of the French,
813	The scarecrow that affrights our children so.
814	Then broke I from the officers that led me,
815	And with my nails digg'd stones out of the ground,
816	To hurl at the beholders of my shame:
817	My grisly countenance made others fly;
818	None durst come near for fear of sudden death.
819	In iron walls they deem'd me not secure;
820	So great fear of my name 'mongst them was spread,
821	That they supposed I could rend bars of steel,
822	And spurn in pieces posts of adamant:
823	Wherefore a guard of chosen shot I had,
824	That walked about me every minute-while;
825	And if I did but stir out of my bed,
826	Ready they were to shoot me to the heart.
827	
828	[Enter the Boy with a linstock]
829	
830	SALISBURY	I grieve to hear what torments you endured,
831	But we will be revenged sufficiently
832	Now it is supper-time in Orleans:
833	Here, through this grate, I count each one
834	and view the Frenchmen how they fortify:
835	Let us look in; the sight will much delight thee.
836	Sir Thomas Gargrave, and Sir William Glansdale,
837	Let me have your express opinions
838	Where is best place to make our battery next.
839	
840	GARGRAVE	I think, at the north gate; for there stand lords.
841	
842	GLANSDALE	And I, here, at the bulwark of the bridge.
843	
844	TALBOT	For aught I see, this city must be famish'd,
845	Or with light skirmishes enfeebled.
846	
847	[Here they shoot. SALISBURY and GARGRAVE fall]
848	
849	SALISBURY	O Lord, have mercy on us, wretched sinners!
850	
851	GARGRAVE	O Lord, have mercy on me, woful man!
852	
853	TALBOT	What chance is this that suddenly hath cross'd us?
854	Speak, Salisbury; at least, if thou canst speak:
855	How farest thou, mirror of all martial men?
856	One of thy eyes and thy cheek's side struck off!
857	Accursed tower! accursed fatal hand
858	That hath contrived this woful tragedy!
859	In thirteen battles Salisbury o'ercame;
860	Henry the Fifth he first train'd to the wars;
861	Whilst any trump did sound, or drum struck up,
862	His sword did ne'er leave striking in the field.
863	Yet livest thou, Salisbury? though thy speech doth fail,
864	One eye thou hast, to look to heaven for grace:
865	The sun with one eye vieweth all the world.
866	Heaven, be thou gracious to none alive,
867	If Salisbury wants mercy at thy hands!
868	Bear hence his body; I will help to bury it.
869	Sir Thomas Gargrave, hast thou any life?
870	Speak unto Talbot; nay, look up to him.
871	Salisbury, cheer thy spirit with this comfort;
872	Thou shalt not die whiles--
873	He beckons with his hand and smiles on me.
874	As who should say 'When I am dead and gone,
875	Remember to avenge me on the French.'
876	Plantagenet, I will; and like thee, Nero,
877	Play on the lute, beholding the towns burn:
878	Wretched shall France be only in my name.
879	
880	[Here an alarum, and it thunders and lightens]
881	
882	What stir is this? what tumult's in the heavens?
883	Whence cometh this alarum and the noise?
884	
885	[Enter a Messenger]
886	
887	Messenger	My lord, my lord, the French have gathered head:
888	The Dauphin, with one Joan la Pucelle join'd,
889	A holy prophetess new risen up,
890	Is come with a great power to raise the siege.
891	
892	[Here SALISBURY lifteth himself up and groans]
893	
894	TALBOT	Hear, hear how dying Salisbury doth groan!
895	It irks his heart he cannot be revenged.
896	Frenchmen, I'll be a Salisbury to you:
897	Pucelle or puzzel, dolphin or dogfish,
898	Your hearts I'll stamp out with my horse's heels,
899	And make a quagmire of your mingled brains.
900	Convey me Salisbury into his tent,
901	And then we'll try what these dastard Frenchmen dare.

919	DAUPHIN, and driveth him: then enter JOAN LA
920	PUCELLE, driving Englishmen before her, and exit
921	after them then re-enter TALBOT]
922	
923	TALBOT	Where is my strength, my valour, and my force?
924	Our English troops retire, I cannot stay them:
925	A woman clad in armour chaseth them.
926	
927	[Re-enter JOAN LA PUCELLE]
928	
929	Here, here she comes. I'll have a bout with thee;
930	Devil or devil's dam, I'll conjure thee:
931	Blood will I draw on thee, thou art a witch,
932	And straightway give thy soul to him thou servest.
933	
934	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Come, come, 'tis only I that must disgrace thee.
935	
936	[Here they fight]
937	
938	TALBOT	Heavens, can you suffer hell so to prevail?
939	My breast I'll burst with straining of my courage
940	And from my shoulders crack my arms asunder.
941	But I will chastise this high-minded strumpet.
942	
943	[They fight again]
944	
945	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Talbot, farewell; thy hour is not yet come:
946	I must go victual Orleans forthwith.
947	
948	[A short alarum; then enter the town with soldiers]
949	
950	O'ertake me, if thou canst; I scorn thy strength.
951	Go, go, cheer up thy hungry-starved men;
952	Help Salisbury to make his testament:
953	This day is ours, as many more shall be.
954	
955	[Exit]

958	I know not where I am, nor what I do;
959	A witch, by fear, not force, like Hannibal,
960	Drives back our troops and conquers as she lists:
961	So bees with smoke and doves with noisome stench
962	Are from their hives and houses driven away.
963	They call'd us for our fierceness English dogs;
964	Now, like to whelps, we crying run away.
965	
966	[A short alarum]
967	
968	Hark, countrymen! either renew the fight,
969	Or tear the lions out of England's coat;
970	Renounce your soil, give sheep in lions' stead:
971	Sheep run not half so treacherous from the wolf,
972	Or horse or oxen from the leopard,
973	As you fly from your oft-subdued slaves.
974	
975	[Alarum. Here another skirmish]

979	For none would strike a stroke in his revenge.
980	Pucelle is enter'd into Orleans,
981	In spite of us or aught that we could do.
982	O, would I were to die with Salisbury!

1009	Thy promises are like Adonis' gardens
1010	That one day bloom'd and fruitful were the next.

1078	As fitting best to quittance their deceit

1098	Let us resolve to scale their flinty bulwarks.

1100	BEDFORD	Ascend, brave Talbot; we will follow thee.
1101	
1102	TALBOT	Not all together: better far, I guess,
1103	That we do make our entrance several ways;
1104	That, if it chance the one of us do fail,

1114	How much in duty I am bound to both.
1115	
1116	Sentinels	Arm! arm! the enemy doth make assault!
1117	
1118	[Cry: 'St. George,' 'A Talbot.']
1119	
1120	[The French leap over the walls in their shirts.
1121	Enter, several ways, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS,
1122	ALENCON, and REIGNIER, half ready, and half unready]
1123	
1124	ALENCON	How now, my lords! what, all unready so?
1125	
1126	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Unready! ay, and glad we 'scaped so well.
1127	
1128	REIGNIER	'Twas time, I trow, to wake and leave our beds,
1129	Hearing alarums at our chamber-doors.
1130	
1131	ALENCON	Of all exploits since first I follow'd arms,
1132	Ne'er heard I of a warlike enterprise
1133	More venturous or desperate than this.
1134	
1135	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	I think this Talbot be a fiend of hell.
1136	
1137	REIGNIER	If not of hell, the heavens, sure, favour him.
1138	
1139	ALENCON	Here cometh Charles: I marvel how he sped.
1140	
1141	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Tut, holy Joan was his defensive guard.
1142	
1143	[Enter CHARLES and JOAN LA PUCELLE]
1144	
1145	CHARLES	Is this thy cunning, thou deceitful dame?
1146	Didst thou at first, to flatter us withal,
1147	Make us partakers of a little gain,
1148	That now our loss might be ten times so much?
1149	
1150	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Wherefore is Charles impatient with his friend!
1151	At all times will you have my power alike?
1152	Sleeping or waking must I still prevail,
1153	Or will you blame and lay the fault on me?
1154	Improvident soldiers! had your watch been good,
1155	This sudden mischief never could have fall'n.
1156	
1157	CHARLES	Duke of Alencon, this was your default,
1158	That, being captain of the watch to-night,
1159	Did look no better to that weighty charge.
1160	
1161	ALENCON	Had all your quarters been as safely kept
1162	As that whereof I had the government,
1163	We had not been thus shamefully surprised.
1164	
1165	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Mine was secure.
1166	
1167	REIGNIER	                  And so was mine, my lord.
1168	
1169	CHARLES	And, for myself, most part of all this night,
1170	Within her quarter and mine own precinct
1171	I was employ'd in passing to and fro,
1172	About relieving of the sentinels:
1173	Then how or which way should they first break in?
1174	
1175	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Question, my lords, no further of the case,
1176	How or which way: 'tis sure they found some place
1177	But weakly guarded, where the breach was made.
1178	And now there rests no other shift but this;
1179	To gather our soldiers, scatter'd and dispersed,
1180	And lay new platforms to endamage them.
1181	
1182	[Alarum. Enter an English Soldier, crying 'A
1183	Talbot! a Talbot!' They fly, leaving their
1184	clothes behind]
1185	
1186	Soldier	I'll be so bold to take what they have left.
1187	The cry of Talbot serves me for a sword;
1188	For I have loaden me with many spoils,
1189	Using no other weapon but his name.

1207	
1208	BEDFORD	The day begins to break, and night is fled,
1209	Whose pitchy mantle over-veil'd the earth.
1210	Here sound retreat, and cease our hot pursuit.
1211	
1212	[Retreat sounded]
1213	
1214	TALBOT	Bring forth the body of old Salisbury,
1215	And here advance it in the market-place,
1216	The middle centre of this cursed town.
1217	Now have I paid my vow unto his soul;
1218	For every drop of blood was drawn from him,
1219	There hath at least five Frenchmen died tonight.
1220	And that hereafter ages may behold
1221	What ruin happen'd in revenge of him,
1222	Within their chiefest temple I'll erect
1223	A tomb, wherein his corpse shall be interr'd:
1224	Upon the which, that every one may read,
1225	Shall be engraved the sack of Orleans,
1226	The treacherous manner of his mournful death
1227	And what a terror he had been to France.
1228	But, lords, in all our bloody massacre,
1229	I muse we met not with the Dauphin's grace,
1230	His new-come champion, virtuous Joan of Arc,
1231	Nor any of his false confederates.
1232	
1233	BEDFORD	'Tis thought, Lord Talbot, when the fight began,
1234	Roused on the sudden from their drowsy beds,
1235	They did amongst the troops of armed men
1236	Leap o'er the walls for refuge in the field.
1237	
1238	BURGUNDY	Myself, as far as I could well discern
1239	For smoke and dusky vapours of the night,
1240	Am sure I scared the Dauphin and his trull,
1241	When arm in arm they both came swiftly running,
1242	Like to a pair of loving turtle-doves
1243	That could not live asunder day or night.
1244	After that things are set in order here,
1245	We'll follow them with all the power we have.
1246	
1247	[Enter a Messenger]
1248	
1249	Messenger	All hail, my lords! which of this princely train
1250	Call ye the warlike Talbot, for his acts
1251	So much applauded through the realm of France?
1252	
1253	TALBOT	Here is the Talbot: who would speak with him?
1254	
1255	Messenger	The virtuous lady, Countess of Auvergne,
1256	With modesty admiring thy renown,
1257	By me entreats, great lord, thou wouldst vouchsafe
1258	To visit her poor castle where she lies,
1259	That she may boast she hath beheld the man
1260	Whose glory fills the world with loud report.
1261	
1262	BURGUNDY	Is it even so? Nay, then, I see our wars
1263	Will turn unto a peaceful comic sport,
1264	When ladies crave to be encounter'd with.
1265	You may not, my lord, despise her gentle suit.
1266	
1267	TALBOT	Ne'er trust me then; for when a world of men
1268	Could not prevail with all their oratory,
1269	Yet hath a woman's kindness over-ruled:
1270	And therefore tell her I return great thanks,
1271	And in submission will attend on her.
1272	Will not your honours bear me company?
1273	
1274	BEDFORD	No, truly; it is more than manners will:
1275	And I have heard it said, unbidden guests
1276	Are often welcomest when they are gone.
1277	
1278	TALBOT	Well then, alone, since there's no remedy,
1279	I mean to prove this lady's courtesy.
1280	Come hither, captain.
1281	
1282	[Whispers]
1283

1316	As Scythian Tomyris by Cyrus' death.
1317	Great is the rumor of this dreadful knight,
1318	And his achievements of no less account:
1319	Fain would mine eyes be witness with mine ears,
1320	To give their censure of these rare reports.
1321	
1322	[Enter Messenger and TALBOT]
1323	
1324	Messenger	Madam,
1325	According as your ladyship desired,
1326	By message craved, so is Lord Talbot come.
1327	
1328	COUNTESS
1329	OF AUVERGNE	And he is welcome. What! is this the man?
1330	
1331	Messenger	Madam, it is.
1332	
1333	COUNTESS
1334	OF AUVERGNE	                  Is this the scourge of France?
1335	Is this the Talbot, so much fear'd abroad
1336	That with his name the mothers still their babes?
1337	I see report is fabulous and false:
1338	I thought I should have seen some Hercules,
1339	A second Hector, for his grim aspect,
1340	And large proportion of his strong-knit limbs.
1341	Alas, this is a child, a silly dwarf!
1342	It cannot be this weak and writhled shrimp
1343	Should strike such terror to his enemies.
1344	
1345	TALBOT	Madam, I have been bold to trouble you;
1346	But since your ladyship is not at leisure,
1347	I'll sort some other time to visit you.
1348	
1349	COUNTESS
1350	OF AUVERGNE	What means he now? Go ask him whither he goes.
1351	
1352	Messenger	Stay, my Lord Talbot; for my lady craves
1353	To know the cause of your abrupt departure.
1354	
1355	TALBOT	Marry, for that she's in a wrong belief,
1356	I go to certify her Talbot's here.
1357	
1358	[Re-enter Porter with keys]

1360	COUNTESS

1362	
1363	TALBOT	Prisoner! to whom?
1364	
1365	COUNTESS
1366	OF AUVERGNE	To me, blood-thirsty lord;
1367	And for that cause I trained thee to my house.
1368	Long time thy shadow hath been thrall to me,
1369	For in my gallery thy picture hangs:
1370	But now the substance shall endure the like,
1371	And I will chain these legs and arms of thine,
1372	That hast by tyranny these many years
1373	Wasted our country, slain our citizens
1374	And sent our sons and husbands captivate.
1375	
1376	TALBOT	Ha, ha, ha!
1377	
1378	COUNTESS
1379	OF AUVERGNE	Laughest thou, wretch? thy mirth shall turn to moan.
1380	
1381	TALBOT	I laugh to see your ladyship so fond
1382	To think that you have aught but Talbot's shadow
1383	Whereon to practise your severity.
1384	
1385	COUNTESS
1386	OF AUVERGNE	Why, art not thou the man?
1387	
1388	TALBOT	I am indeed.
1389	
1390	COUNTESS
1391	OF AUVERGNE	Then have I substance too.
1392	
1393	TALBOT	No, no, I am but shadow of myself:
1394	You are deceived, my substance is not here;
1395	For what you see is but the smallest part
1396	And least proportion of humanity:
1397	I tell you, madam, were the whole frame here,
1398	It is of such a spacious lofty pitch,
1399	Your roof were not sufficient to contain't.
1400	
1401	COUNTESS
1402	OF AUVERGNE	This is a riddling merchant for the nonce;
1403	He will be here, and yet he is not here:
1404	How can these contrarieties agree?
1405	
1406	TALBOT	That will I show you presently.
1407	
1408	[Winds his horn. Drums strike up: a peal of
1409	ordnance. Enter soldiers]
1410	
1411	How say you, madam? are you now persuaded
1412	That Talbot is but shadow of himself?
1413	These are his substance, sinews, arms and strength,
1414	With which he yoketh your rebellious necks,
1415	Razeth your cities and subverts your towns
1416	And in a moment makes them desolate.
1417	
1418	COUNTESS
1419	OF AUVERGNE	Victorious Talbot! pardon my abuse:
1420	I find thou art no less than fame hath bruited
1421	And more than may be gather'd by thy shape.
1422	Let my presumption not provoke thy wrath;
1423	For I am sorry that with reverence
1424	I did not entertain thee as thou art.
1425	
1426	TALBOT	Be not dismay'd, fair lady; nor misconstrue
1427	The mind of Talbot, as you did mistake
1428	The outward composition of his body.
1429	What you have done hath not offended me;
1430	Nor other satisfaction do I crave,
1431	But only, with your patience, that we may
1432	Taste of your wine and see what cates you have;
1433	For soldiers' stomachs always serve them well.

1454	RICHARD PLANTAGENET, VERNON, and another Lawyer]
1455	
1456	RICHARD
1457	PLANTAGENET	Great lords and gentlemen, what means this silence?
1458	Dare no man answer in a case of truth?
1459	
1460	SUFFOLK	Within the Temple-hall we were too loud;
1461	The garden here is more convenient.
1462	
1463	RICHARD
1464	PLANTAGENET	Then say at once if I maintain'd the truth;
1465	Or else was wrangling Somerset in the error?
1466	
1467	SUFFOLK	Faith, I have been a truant in the law,
1468	And never yet could frame my will to it;
1469	And therefore frame the law unto my will.
1470	
1471	SOMERSET	Judge you, my Lord of Warwick, then, between us.
1472	
1473	WARWICK	Between two hawks, which flies the higher pitch;
1474	Between two dogs, which hath the deeper mouth;
1475	Between two blades, which bears the better temper:
1476	Between two horses, which doth bear him best;
1477	Between two girls, which hath the merriest eye;
1478	I have perhaps some shallow spirit of judgement;
1479	But in these nice sharp quillets of the law,
1480	Good faith, I am no wiser than a daw.
1481	
1482	RICHARD
1483	PLANTAGENET	Tut, tut, here is a mannerly forbearance:
1484	The truth appears so naked on my side
1485	That any purblind eye may find it out.
1486	
1487	SOMERSET	And on my side it is so well apparell'd,
1488	So clear, so shining and so evident
1489	That it will glimmer through a blind man's eye.
1490	
1491	RICHARD
1492	PLANTAGENET	Since you are tongue-tied and so loath to speak,
1493	In dumb significants proclaim your thoughts:
1494	Let him that is a true-born gentleman
1495	And stands upon the honour of his birth,
1496	If he suppose that I have pleaded truth,
1497	From off this brier pluck a white rose with me.
1498	
1499	SOMERSET	Let him that is no coward nor no flatterer,
1500	But dare maintain the party of the truth,
1501	Pluck a red rose from off this thorn with me.
1502	
1503	WARWICK	I love no colours, and without all colour
1504	Of base insinuating flattery
1505	I pluck this white rose with Plantagenet.
1506	
1507	SUFFOLK	I pluck this red rose with young Somerset
1508	And say withal I think he held the right.
1509	
1510	VERNON	Stay, lords and gentlemen, and pluck no more,
1511	Till you conclude that he upon whose side
1512	The fewest roses are cropp'd from the tree
1513	Shall yield the other in the right opinion.
1514	
1515	SOMERSET	Good Master Vernon, it is well objected:
1516	If I have fewest, I subscribe in silence.
1517	
1518	RICHARD
1519	PLANTAGENET	And I.
1520	
1521	VERNON	Then for the truth and plainness of the case.
1522	I pluck this pale and maiden blossom here,
1523	Giving my verdict on the white rose side.
1524	
1525	SOMERSET	Prick not your finger as you pluck it off,
1526	Lest bleeding you do paint the white rose red
1527	And fall on my side so, against your will.
1528	
1529	VERNON	If I my lord, for my opinion bleed,
1530	Opinion shall be surgeon to my hurt
1531	And keep me on the side where still I am.
1532	
1533	SOMERSET	Well, well, come on: who else?
1534	
1535	Lawyer	Unless my study and my books be false,
1536	The argument you held was wrong in you:
1537	
1538	[To SOMERSET]
1539	
1540	In sign whereof I pluck a white rose too.
1541	
1542	RICHARD
1543	PLANTAGENET	Now, Somerset, where is your argument?
1544	
1545	SOMERSET	Here in my scabbard, meditating that
1546	Shall dye your white rose in a bloody red.
1547	
1548	RICHARD
1549	PLANTAGENET	Meantime your cheeks do counterfeit our roses;
1550	For pale they look with fear, as witnessing
1551	The truth on our side.
1552	
1553	SOMERSET	No, Plantagenet,
1554	'Tis not for fear but anger that thy cheeks
1555	Blush for pure shame to counterfeit our roses,
1556	And yet thy tongue will not confess thy error.
1557	
1558	RICHARD
1559	PLANTAGENET	Hath not thy rose a canker, Somerset?
1560	
1561	SOMERSET	Hath not thy rose a thorn, Plantagenet?
1562	
1563	RICHARD
1564	PLANTAGENET	Ay, sharp and piercing, to maintain his truth;
1565	Whiles thy consuming canker eats his falsehood.
1566	
1567	SOMERSET	Well, I'll find friends to wear my bleeding roses,
1568	That shall maintain what I have said is true,
1569	Where false Plantagenet dare not be seen.
1570	
1571	RICHARD
1572	PLANTAGENET	Now, by this maiden blossom in my hand,
1573	I scorn thee and thy fashion, peevish boy.
1574	
1575	SUFFOLK	Turn not thy scorns this way, Plantagenet.
1576	
1577	RICHARD
1578	PLANTAGENET	Proud Pole, I will, and scorn both him and thee.
1579	
1580	SUFFOLK	I'll turn my part thereof into thy throat.
1581	
1582	SOMERSET	Away, away, good William de la Pole!
1583	We grace the yeoman by conversing with him.
1584	
1585	WARWICK	Now, by God's will, thou wrong'st him, Somerset;
1586	His grandfather was Lionel Duke of Clarence,
1587	Third son to the third Edward King of England:
1588	Spring crestless yeomen from so deep a root?
1589	
1590	RICHARD
1591	PLANTAGENET	He bears him on the place's privilege,
1592	Or durst not, for his craven heart, say thus.
1593	
1594	SOMERSET	By him that made me, I'll maintain my words
1595	On any plot of ground in Christendom.
1596	Was not thy father, Richard Earl of Cambridge,
1597	For treason executed in our late king's days?
1598	And, by his treason, stand'st not thou attainted,
1599	Corrupted, and exempt from ancient gentry?
1600	His trespass yet lives guilty in thy blood;
1601	And, till thou be restored, thou art a yeoman.
1602	
1603	RICHARD
1604	PLANTAGENET	My father was attached, not attainted,
1605	Condemn'd to die for treason, but no traitor;
1606	And that I'll prove on better men than Somerset,
1607	Were growing time once ripen'd to my will.
1608	For your partaker Pole and you yourself,
1609	I'll note you in my book of memory,
1610	To scourge you for this apprehension:
1611	Look to it well and say you are well warn'd.
1612	
1613	SOMERSET	Ah, thou shalt find us ready for thee still;
1614	And know us by these colours for thy foes,
1615	For these my friends in spite of thee shall wear.
1616	
1617	RICHARD
1618	PLANTAGENET	And, by my soul, this pale and angry rose,
1619	As cognizance of my blood-drinking hate,
1620	Will I for ever and my faction wear,
1621	Until it wither with me to my grave
1622	Or flourish to the height of my degree.
1623	
1624	SUFFOLK	Go forward and be choked with thy ambition!
1625	And so farewell until I meet thee next.
1626	
1627	[Exit]
1628	
1629	SOMERSET	Have with thee, Pole. Farewell, ambitious Richard.
1630	
1631	[Exit]
1632	
1633	RICHARD
1634	PLANTAGENET	How I am braved and must perforce endure it!
1635	
1636	WARWICK	This blot that they object against your house
1637	Shall be wiped out in the next parliament
1638	Call'd for the truce of Winchester and Gloucester;
1639	And if thou be not then created York,
1640	I will not live to be accounted Warwick.
1641	Meantime, in signal of my love to thee,
1642	Against proud Somerset and William Pole,
1643	Will I upon thy party wear this rose:
1644	And here I prophesy: this brawl to-day,
1645	Grown to this faction in the Temple-garden,
1646	Shall send between the red rose and the white
1647	A thousand souls to death and deadly night.

1649	RICHARD
1650	PLANTAGENET	Good Master Vernon, I am bound to you,
1651	That you on my behalf would pluck a flower.
1652	
1653	VERNON	In your behalf still will I wear the same.
1654	
1655	Lawyer	And so will I.
1656	
1657	RICHARD
1658	PLANTAGENET	Thanks, gentle sir.
1659	Come, let us four to dinner: I dare say
1660	This quarrel will drink blood another day.

1667	1 KING HENRY VI
1668	
1669	
1670	ACT II
1671	
1672	
1673	SCENE V	The Tower of London.
1674	
1675	
1676	[Enter MORTIMER, brought in a chair, and Gaolers]
1677	
1678	MORTIMER	Kind keepers of my weak decaying age,
1679	Let dying Mortimer here rest himself.
1680	Even like a man new haled from the rack,
1681	So fare my limbs with long imprisonment.
1682	And these grey locks, the pursuivants of death,
1683	Nestor-like aged in an age of care,
1684	Argue the end of Edmund Mortimer.
1685	These eyes, like lamps whose wasting oil is spent,
1686	Wax dim, as drawing to their exigent;
1687	Weak shoulders, overborne with burthening grief,
1688	And pithless arms, like to a wither'd vine
1689	That droops his sapless branches to the ground;
1690	Yet are these feet, whose strengthless stay is numb,
1691	Unable to support this lump of clay,
1692	Swift-winged with desire to get a grave,
1693	As witting I no other comfort have.
1694	But tell me, keeper, will my nephew come?
1695	
1696	First Gaoler	Richard Plantagenet, my lord, will come:
1697	We sent unto the Temple, unto his chamber;
1698	And answer was return'd that he will come.
1699	
1700	MORTIMER	Enough: my soul shall then be satisfied.
1701	Poor gentleman! his wrong doth equal mine.
1702	Since Henry Monmouth first began to reign,
1703	Before whose glory I was great in arms,
1704	This loathsome sequestration have I had:
1705	And even since then hath Richard been obscured,
1706	Deprived of honour and inheritance.
1707	But now the arbitrator of despairs,
1708	Just death, kind umpire of men's miseries,
1709	With sweet enlargement doth dismiss me hence:
1710	I would his troubles likewise were expired,
1711	That so he might recover what was lost.
1712	
1713	[Enter RICHARD PLANTAGENET]
1714	
1715	First Gaoler	My lord, your loving nephew now is come.
1716	
1717	MORTIMER	Richard Plantagenet, my friend, is he come?
1718	
1719	RICHARD
1720	PLANTAGENET	Ay, noble uncle, thus ignobly used,
1721	Your nephew, late despised Richard, comes.
1722	
1723	MORTIMER	Direct mine arms I may embrace his neck,
1724	And in his bosom spend my latter gasp:
1725	O, tell me when my lips do touch his cheeks,
1726	That I may kindly give one fainting kiss.
1727	And now declare, sweet stem from York's great stock,
1728	Why didst thou say, of late thou wert despised?
1729	
1730	RICHARD
1731	PLANTAGENET	First, lean thine aged back against mine arm;
1732	And, in that ease, I'll tell thee my disease.
1733	This day, in argument upon a case,
1734	Some words there grew 'twixt Somerset and me;
1735	Among which terms he used his lavish tongue
1736	And did upbraid me with my father's death:
1737	Which obloquy set bars before my tongue,
1738	Else with the like I had requited him.
1739	Therefore, good uncle, for my father's sake,
1740	In honour of a true Plantagenet
1741	And for alliance sake, declare the cause
1742	My father, Earl of Cambridge, lost his head.
1743	
1744	MORTIMER	That cause, fair nephew, that imprison'd me
1745	And hath detain'd me all my flowering youth
1746	Within a loathsome dungeon, there to pine,
1747	Was cursed instrument of his decease.
1748	
1749	RICHARD
1750	PLANTAGENET	Discover more at large what cause that was,
1751	For I am ignorant and cannot guess.
1752	
1753	MORTIMER	I will, if that my fading breath permit
1754	And death approach not ere my tale be done.
1755	Henry the Fourth, grandfather to this king,
1756	Deposed his nephew Richard, Edward's son,
1757	The first-begotten and the lawful heir,
1758	Of Edward king, the third of that descent:
1759	During whose reign the Percies of the north,
1760	Finding his usurpation most unjust,
1761	Endeavor'd my advancement to the throne:
1762	The reason moved these warlike lords to this
1763	Was, for that--young King Richard thus removed,
1764	Leaving no heir begotten of his body--
1765	I was the next by birth and parentage;
1766	For by my mother I derived am
1767	From Lionel Duke of Clarence, the third son
1768	To King Edward the Third; whereas he
1769	From John of Gaunt doth bring his pedigree,
1770	Being but fourth of that heroic line.
1771	But mark: as in this haughty attempt
1772	They laboured to plant the rightful heir,
1773	I lost my liberty and they their lives.
1774	Long after this, when Henry the Fifth,
1775	Succeeding his father Bolingbroke, did reign,
1776	Thy father, Earl of Cambridge, then derived
1777	From famous Edmund Langley, Duke of York,
1778	Marrying my sister that thy mother was,
1779	Again in pity of my hard distress
1780	Levied an army, weening to redeem
1781	And have install'd me in the diadem:
1782	But, as the rest, so fell that noble earl
1783	And was beheaded. Thus the Mortimers,
1784	In whom the tide rested, were suppress'd.
1785	
1786	RICHARD
1787	PLANTAGENET	Of which, my lord, your honour is the last.
1788	
1789	MORTIMER	True; and thou seest that I no issue have
1790	And that my fainting words do warrant death;
1791	Thou art my heir; the rest I wish thee gather:
1792	But yet be wary in thy studious care.
1793	
1794	RICHARD
1795	PLANTAGENET	Thy grave admonishments prevail with me:
1796	But yet, methinks, my father's execution
1797	Was nothing less than bloody tyranny.
1798	
1799	MORTIMER	With silence, nephew, be thou politic:
1800	Strong-fixed is the house of Lancaster,
1801	And like a mountain, not to be removed.
1802	But now thy uncle is removing hence:
1803	As princes do their courts, when they are cloy'd
1804	With long continuance in a settled place.
1805	
1806	RICHARD
1807	PLANTAGENET	O, uncle, would some part of my young years
1808	Might but redeem the passage of your age!
1809	
1810	MORTIMER	Thou dost then wrong me, as that slaughterer doth
1811	Which giveth many wounds when one will kill.
1812	Mourn not, except thou sorrow for my good;
1813	Only give order for my funeral:
1814	And so farewell, and fair be all thy hopes
1815	And prosperous be thy life in peace and war!
1816	
1817	[Dies]
1818	
1819	RICHARD
1820	PLANTAGENET	And peace, no war, befall thy parting soul!
1821	In prison hast thou spent a pilgrimage
1822	And like a hermit overpass'd thy days.
1823	Well, I will lock his counsel in my breast;
1824	And what I do imagine let that rest.
1825	Keepers, convey him hence, and I myself
1826	Will see his burial better than his life.
1827	
1828	[Exeunt Gaolers, bearing out the body of MORTIMER]
1829	
1830	Here dies the dusky torch of Mortimer,
1831	Choked with ambition of the meaner sort:
1832	And for those wrongs, those bitter injuries,
1833	Which Somerset hath offer'd to my house:
1834	I doubt not but with honour to redress;
1835	And therefore haste I to the parliament,
1836	Either to be restored to my blood,
1837	Or make my ill the advantage of my good.
1838

1847	ACT III
1848	
1849	
1850	
1851	SCENE I	London. The Parliament-house.
1852	
1853	
1854	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VI, EXETER, GLOUCESTER,
1855	WARWICK, SOMERSET, and SUFFOLK; the BISHOP OF
1856	WINCHESTER, RICHARD PLANTAGENET, and others.
1857	GLOUCESTER offers to put up a bill; BISHOP OF
1858	WINCHESTER snatches it, and tears it]
1859	
1860	BISHOP
1861	OF WINCHESTER	Comest thou with deep premeditated lines,
1862	With written pamphlets studiously devised,
1863	Humphrey of Gloucester? If thou canst accuse,
1864	Or aught intend'st to lay unto my charge,
1865	Do it without invention, suddenly;
1866	As I with sudden and extemporal speech
1867	Purpose to answer what thou canst object.
1868	
1869	GLOUCESTER	Presumptuous priest! this place commands my patience,
1870	Or thou shouldst find thou hast dishonour'd me.
1871	Think not, although in writing I preferr'd
1872	The manner of thy vile outrageous crimes,
1873	That therefore I have forged, or am not able
1874	Verbatim to rehearse the method of my pen:
1875	No, prelate; such is thy audacious wickedness,
1876	Thy lewd, pestiferous and dissentious pranks,
1877	As very infants prattle of thy pride.
1878	Thou art a most pernicious usurer,
1879	Forward by nature, enemy to peace;
1880	Lascivious, wanton, more than well beseems
1881	A man of thy profession and degree;
1882	And for thy treachery, what's more manifest?
1883	In that thou laid'st a trap to take my life,
1884	As well at London bridge as at the Tower.
1885	Beside, I fear me, if thy thoughts were sifted,
1886	The king, thy sovereign, is not quite exempt
1887	From envious malice of thy swelling heart.
1888	
1889	BISHOP
1890	OF WINCHESTER	Gloucester, I do defy thee. Lords, vouchsafe
1891	To give me hearing what I shall reply.
1892	If I were covetous, ambitious or perverse,
1893	As he will have me, how am I so poor?
1894	Or how haps it I seek not to advance
1895	Or raise myself, but keep my wonted calling?
1896	And for dissension, who preferreth peace
1897	More than I do?--except I be provoked.
1898	No, my good lords, it is not that offends;
1899	It is not that that hath incensed the duke:
1900	It is, because no one should sway but he;
1901	No one but he should be about the king;
1902	And that engenders thunder in his breast
1903	And makes him roar these accusations forth.
1904	But he shall know I am as good--
1905	
1906	GLOUCESTER	As good!
1907	Thou bastard of my grandfather!
1908	
1909	BISHOP
1910	OF WINCHESTER	Ay, lordly sir; for what are you, I pray,
1911	But one imperious in another's throne?
1912	
1913	GLOUCESTER	Am I not protector, saucy priest?
1914	
1915	BISHOP
1916	OF WINCHESTER	And am not I a prelate of the church?
1917	
1918	GLOUCESTER	Yes, as an outlaw in a castle keeps
1919	And useth it to patronage his theft.
1920	
1921	BISHOP
1922	OF WINCHESTER	Unreverent Gloster!
1923	
1924	GLOUCESTER	Thou art reverent
1925	Touching thy spiritual function, not thy life.
1926	
1927	BISHOP
1928	OF WINCHESTER	Rome shall remedy this.
1929	
1930	WARWICK	Roam thither, then.
1931	
1932	SOMERSET	My lord, it were your duty to forbear.
1933	
1934	WARWICK	Ay, see the bishop be not overborne.
1935	
1936	SOMERSET	Methinks my lord should be religious
1937	And know the office that belongs to such.
1938	
1939	WARWICK	Methinks his lordship should be humbler;
1940	it fitteth not a prelate so to plead.
1941	
1942	SOMERSET	Yes, when his holy state is touch'd so near.
1943	
1944	WARWICK	State holy or unhallow'd, what of that?
1945	Is not his grace protector to the king?
1946	
1947	RICHARD
1948	PLANTAGENET	[Aside]  Plantagenet, I see, must hold his tongue,
1949	Lest it be said 'Speak, sirrah, when you should;
1950	Must your bold verdict enter talk with lords?'
1951	Else would I have a fling at Winchester.
1952	
1953	KING HENRY VI	Uncles of Gloucester and of Winchester,
1954	The special watchmen of our English weal,
1955	I would prevail, if prayers might prevail,
1956	To join your hearts in love and amity.
1957	O, what a scandal is it to our crown,
1958	That two such noble peers as ye should jar!
1959	Believe me, lords, my tender years can tell
1960	Civil dissension is a viperous worm
1961	That gnaws the bowels of the commonwealth.
1962	
1963	[A noise within, 'Down with the tawny-coats!']
1964	
1965	What tumult's this?
1966	
1967	WARWICK	An uproar, I dare warrant,
1968	Begun through malice of the bishop's men.
1969	
1970	[A noise again, 'Stones! stones!' Enter Mayor]
1971	
1972	Mayor	O, my good lords, and virtuous Henry,
1973	Pity the city of London, pity us!
1974	The bishop and the Duke of Gloucester's men,
1975	Forbidden late to carry any weapon,
1976	Have fill'd their pockets full of pebble stones
1977	And banding themselves in contrary parts
1978	Do pelt so fast at one another's pate
1979	That many have their giddy brains knock'd out:
1980	Our windows are broke down in every street
1981	And we for fear compell'd to shut our shops.
1982	
1983	[Enter Serving-men, in skirmish, with bloody pates]
1984	
1985	KING HENRY VI	We charge you, on allegiance to ourself,
1986	To hold your slaughtering hands and keep the peace.
1987	Pray, uncle Gloucester, mitigate this strife.
1988	
1989	First Serving-man	Nay, if we be forbidden stones,
1990	We'll fall to it with our teeth.
1991	
1992	Second Serving-man	Do what ye dare, we are as resolute.
1993	
1994	[Skirmish again]
1995	
1996	GLOUCESTER	You of my household, leave this peevish broil
1997	And set this unaccustom'd fight aside.
1998	
1999	Third Serving-man	My lord, we know your grace to be a man
2000	Just and upright; and, for your royal birth,
2001	Inferior to none but to his majesty:
2002	And ere that we will suffer such a prince,
2003	So kind a father of the commonweal,
2004	To be disgraced by an inkhorn mate,
2005	We and our wives and children all will fight
2006	And have our bodies slaughtered by thy foes.
2007	
2008	First Serving-man	Ay, and the very parings of our nails
2009	Shall pitch a field when we are dead.
2010	
2011	[Begin again]
2012	
2013	GLOUCESTER	Stay, stay, I say!
2014	And if you love me, as you say you do,
2015	Let me persuade you to forbear awhile.
2016	
2017	KING HENRY VI	O, how this discord doth afflict my soul!
2018	Can you, my Lord of Winchester, behold
2019	My sighs and tears and will not once relent?
2020	Who should be pitiful, if you be not?
2021	Or who should study to prefer a peace.
2022	If holy churchmen take delight in broils?
2023	
2024	WARWICK	Yield, my lord protector; yield, Winchester;
2025	Except you mean with obstinate repulse
2026	To slay your sovereign and destroy the realm.
2027	You see what mischief and what murder too
2028	Hath been enacted through your enmity;
2029	Then be at peace except ye thirst for blood.
2030	
2031	BISHOP
2032	OF WINCHESTER	He shall submit, or I will never yield.
2033	
2034	GLOUCESTER	Compassion on the king commands me stoop;
2035	Or I would see his heart out, ere the priest
2036	Should ever get that privilege of me.
2037	
2038	WARWICK	Behold, my Lord of Winchester, the duke
2039	Hath banish'd moody discontented fury,
2040	As by his smoothed brows it doth appear:
2041	Why look you still so stern and tragical?
2042	
2043	GLOUCESTER	Here, Winchester, I offer thee my hand.
2044	
2045	KING HENRY VI	Fie, uncle Beaufort! I have heard you preach
2046	That malice was a great and grievous sin;
2047	And will not you maintain the thing you teach,
2048	But prove a chief offender in the same?
2049	
2050	WARWICK	Sweet king! the bishop hath a kindly gird.
2051	For shame, my lord of Winchester, relent!
2052	What, shall a child instruct you what to do?
2053	
2054	BISHOP
2055	OF WINCHESTER	Well, Duke of Gloucester, I will yield to thee;
2056	Love for thy love and hand for hand I give.
2057	
2058	GLOUCESTER	[Aside]  Ay, but, I fear me, with a hollow heart.--
2059	See here, my friends and loving countrymen,
2060	This token serveth for a flag of truce
2061	Betwixt ourselves and all our followers:
2062	So help me God, as I dissemble not!
2063	
2064	BISHOP
2065	OF WINCHESTER	[Aside]  So help me God, as I intend it not!
2066	
2067	KING HENRY VI	O, loving uncle, kind Duke of Gloucester,
2068	How joyful am I made by this contract!
2069	Away, my masters! trouble us no more;
2070	But join in friendship, as your lords have done.
2071	
2072	First Serving-man	Content: I'll to the surgeon's.
2073	
2074	Second Serving-man	And so will I.
2075	
2076	Third Serving-man	And I will see what physic the tavern affords.
2077	
2078	[Exeunt Serving-men, Mayor, &c]
2079	
2080	WARWICK	Accept this scroll, most gracious sovereign,
2081	Which in the right of Richard Plantagenet
2082	We do exhibit to your majesty.
2083	
2084	GLOUCESTER	Well urged, my Lord of Warwick: or sweet prince,
2085	And if your grace mark every circumstance,
2086	You have great reason to do Richard right;
2087	Especially for those occasions
2088	At Eltham Place I told your majesty.
2089	
2090	KING HENRY VI	And those occasions, uncle, were of force:
2091	Therefore, my loving lords, our pleasure is
2092	That Richard be restored to his blood.
2093	
2094	WARWICK	Let Richard be restored to his blood;
2095	So shall his father's wrongs be recompensed.
2096	
2097	BISHOP
2098	OF WINCHESTER	As will the rest, so willeth Winchester.
2099	
2100	KING HENRY VI	If Richard will be true, not that alone
2101	But all the whole inheritance I give
2102	That doth belong unto the house of York,
2103	From whence you spring by lineal descent.
2104	
2105	RICHARD
2106	PLANTAGENET	Thy humble servant vows obedience
2107	And humble service till the point of death.
2108	
2109	KING HENRY VI	Stoop then and set your knee against my foot;
2110	And, in reguerdon of that duty done,
2111	I gird thee with the valiant sword of York:
2112	Rise Richard, like a true Plantagenet,
2113	And rise created princely Duke of York.
2114	
2115	RICHARD
2116	PLANTAGENET	And so thrive Richard as thy foes may fall!
2117	And as my duty springs, so perish they
2118	That grudge one thought against your majesty!
2119	
2120	ALL	Welcome, high prince, the mighty Duke of York!
2121	
2122	SOMERSET	[Aside]  Perish, base prince, ignoble Duke of York!
2123	
2124	GLOUCESTER	Now will it best avail your majesty
2125	To cross the seas and to be crown'd in France:
2126	The presence of a king engenders love
2127	Amongst his subjects and his loyal friends,
2128	As it disanimates his enemies.
2129	
2130	KING HENRY VI	When Gloucester says the word, King Henry goes;
2131	For friendly counsel cuts off many foes.
2132	
2133	GLOUCESTER	Your ships already are in readiness.
2134	
2135	[Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but EXETER]
2136	
2137	EXETER	Ay, we may march in England or in France,
2138	Not seeing what is likely to ensue.
2139	This late dissension grown betwixt the peers
2140	Burns under feigned ashes of forged love
2141	And will at last break out into a flame:
2142	As fester'd members rot but by degree,
2143	Till bones and flesh and sinews fall away,
2144	So will this base and envious discord breed.
2145	And now I fear that fatal prophecy
2146	Which in the time of Henry named the Fifth
2147	Was in the mouth of every sucking babe;
2148	That Henry born at Monmouth should win all
2149	And Henry born at Windsor lose all:
2150	Which is so plain that Exeter doth wish
2151	His days may finish ere that hapless time.

2169	with sacks upon their backs]
2170	
2171	JOAN LA PUCELLE	These are the city gates, the gates of Rouen,
2172	Through which our policy must make a breach:
2173	Take heed, be wary how you place your words;
2174	Talk like the vulgar sort of market men
2175	That come to gather money for their corn.
2176	If we have entrance, as I hope we shall,
2177	And that we find the slothful watch but weak,
2178	I'll by a sign give notice to our friends,
2179	That Charles the Dauphin may encounter them.
2180	
2181	First Soldier	Our sacks shall be a mean to sack the city,
2182	And we be lords and rulers over Rouen;
2183	Therefore we'll knock.
2184	
2185	[Knocks]
2186	
2187	Watch	[Within]  Qui est la?
2188	
2189	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Paysans, pauvres gens de France;
2190	Poor market folks that come to sell their corn.
2191	
2192	Watch	Enter, go in; the market bell is rung.
2193	
2194	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Now, Rouen, I'll shake thy bulwarks to the ground.
2195	
2196	[Exeunt]
2197	
2198	[Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON,
2199	REIGNIER, and forces]
2200	
2201	CHARLES	Saint Denis bless this happy stratagem!
2202	And once again we'll sleep secure in Rouen.
2203	
2204	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Here enter'd Pucelle and her practisants;
2205	Now she is there, how will she specify
2206	Where is the best and safest passage in?
2207	
2208	REIGNIER	By thrusting out a torch from yonder tower;
2209	Which, once discern'd, shows that her meaning is,
2210	No way to that, for weakness, which she enter'd.
2211	
2212	[Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE on the top, thrusting out a
2213	torch burning]
2214	
2215	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Behold, this is the happy wedding torch
2216	That joineth Rouen unto her countrymen,
2217	But burning fatal to the Talbotites!
2218	
2219	[Exit]
2220	
2221	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	See, noble Charles, the beacon of our friend;
2222	The burning torch in yonder turret stands.
2223	
2224	CHARLES	Now shine it like a comet of revenge,
2225	A prophet to the fall of all our foes!
2226	
2227	REIGNIER	Defer no time, delays have dangerous ends;
2228	Enter, and cry 'The Dauphin!' presently,
2229	And then do execution on the watch.
2230	
2231	[Alarum. Exeunt]
2232	
2233	[An alarum. Enter TALBOT in an excursion]
2234	
2235	TALBOT	France, thou shalt rue this treason with thy tears,
2236	If Talbot but survive thy treachery.
2237	Pucelle, that witch, that damned sorceress,
2238	Hath wrought this hellish mischief unawares,
2239	That hardly we escaped the pride of France.
2240	
2241	[Exit]

2243	[An alarum: excursions. BEDFORD, brought in sick
2244	in a chair. Enter TALBOT and BURGUNDY without:
2245	within JOAN LA PUCELLE, CHARLES, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,
2246	ALENCON, and REIGNIER, on the walls]
2247	
2248	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Good morrow, gallants! want ye corn for bread?
2249	I think the Duke of Burgundy will fast
2250	Before he'll buy again at such a rate:
2251	'Twas full of darnel; do you like the taste?
2252	
2253	BURGUNDY	Scoff on, vile fiend and shameless courtezan!
2254	I trust ere long to choke thee with thine own
2255	And make thee curse the harvest of that corn.
2256	
2257	CHARLES	Your grace may starve perhaps before that time.
2258	
2259	BEDFORD	O, let no words, but deeds, revenge this treason!
2260	
2261	JOAN LA PUCELLE	What will you do, good grey-beard? break a lance,
2262	And run a tilt at death within a chair?
2263	
2264	TALBOT	Foul fiend of France, and hag of all despite,
2265	Encompass'd with thy lustful paramours!
2266	Becomes it thee to taunt his valiant age
2267	And twit with cowardice a man half dead?
2268	Damsel, I'll have a bout with you again,
2269	Or else let Talbot perish with this shame.
2270	
2271	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Are ye so hot, sir? yet, Pucelle, hold thy peace;
2272	If Talbot do but thunder, rain will follow.
2273	
2274	[The English whisper together in council]
2275	
2276	God speed the parliament! who shall be the speaker?
2277	
2278	TALBOT	Dare ye come forth and meet us in the field?
2279	
2280	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Belike your lordship takes us then for fools,
2281	To try if that our own be ours or no.
2282	
2283	TALBOT	I speak not to that railing Hecate,
2284	But unto thee, Alencon, and the rest;
2285	Will ye, like soldiers, come and fight it out?
2286	
2287	ALENCON	Signior, no.
2288	
2289	TALBOT	Signior, hang! base muleters of France!
2290	Like peasant foot-boys do they keep the walls
2291	And dare not take up arms like gentlemen.
2292	
2293	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Away, captains! let's get us from the walls;
2294	For Talbot means no goodness by his looks.
2295	God be wi' you, my lord! we came but to tell you
2296	That we are here.
2297	
2298	[Exeunt from the walls]
2299	
2300	TALBOT	And there will we be too, ere it be long,
2301	Or else reproach be Talbot's greatest fame!
2302	Vow, Burgundy, by honour of thy house,
2303	Prick'd on by public wrongs sustain'd in France,
2304	Either to get the town again or die:
2305	And I, as sure as English Henry lives
2306	And as his father here was conqueror,
2307	As sure as in this late-betrayed town
2308	Great Coeur-de-lion's heart was buried,
2309	So sure I swear to get the town or die.
2310	
2311	BURGUNDY	My vows are equal partners with thy vows.
2312	
2313	TALBOT	But, ere we go, regard this dying prince,
2314	The valiant Duke of Bedford. Come, my lord,
2315	We will bestow you in some better place,
2316	Fitter for sickness and for crazy age.
2317	
2318	BEDFORD	Lord Talbot, do not so dishonour me:
2319	Here will I sit before the walls of Rouen
2320	And will be partner of your weal or woe.
2321	
2322	BURGUNDY	Courageous Bedford, let us now persuade you.
2323	
2324	BEDFORD	Not to be gone from hence; for once I read
2325	That stout Pendragon in his litter sick
2326	Came to the field and vanquished his foes:
2327	Methinks I should revive the soldiers' hearts,
2328	Because I ever found them as myself.
2329	
2330	TALBOT	Undaunted spirit in a dying breast!
2331	Then be it so: heavens keep old Bedford safe!
2332	And now no more ado, brave Burgundy,
2333	But gather we our forces out of hand
2334	And set upon our boasting enemy.
2335	
2336	[Exeunt all but BEDFORD and Attendants]
2337	
2338	[An alarum: excursions. Enter FASTOLFE and
2339	a Captain]
2340	
2341	Captain	Whither away, Sir John Fastolfe, in such haste?
2342	
2343	FASTOLFE	Whither away! to save myself by flight:
2344	We are like to have the overthrow again.
2345	
2346	Captain	What! will you fly, and leave Lord Talbot?
2347	
2348	FASTOLFE	Ay,
2349	All the Talbots in the world, to save my life!

2361	For I have seen our enemies' overthrow.
2362	What is the trust or strength of foolish man?
2363	They that of late were daring with their scoffs
2364	Are glad and fain by flight to save themselves.

2371	This is a double honour, Burgundy:
2372	Yet heavens have glory for this victory!
2373	
2374	BURGUNDY	Warlike and martial Talbot, Burgundy
2375	Enshrines thee in his heart and there erects
2376	Thy noble deeds as valour's monuments.
2377	
2378	TALBOT	Thanks, gentle duke. But where is Pucelle now?
2379	I think her old familiar is asleep:
2380	Now where's the Bastard's braves, and Charles his gleeks?
2381	What, all amort? Rouen hangs her head for grief
2382	That such a valiant company are fled.
2383	Now will we take some order in the town,
2384	Placing therein some expert officers,
2385	And then depart to Paris to the king,
2386	For there young Henry with his nobles lie.
2387	
2388	BURGUNDY	What wills Lord Talbot pleaseth Burgundy.
2389	
2390	TALBOT	But yet, before we go, let's not forget
2391	The noble Duke of Bedford late deceased,
2392	But see his exequies fulfill'd in Rouen:
2393	A braver soldier never couched lance,
2394	A gentler heart did never sway in court;
2395	But kings and mightiest potentates must die,
2396	For that's the end of human misery.

2410	SCENE III	The plains near Rouen.
2411	
2412	
2413	[Enter CHARLES, the BASTARD OF ORLEANS, ALENCON, JOAN
2414	LA PUCELLE, and forces]
2415	
2416	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Dismay not, princes, at this accident,
2417	Nor grieve that Rouen is so recovered:
2418	Care is no cure, but rather corrosive,
2419	For things that are not to be remedied.
2420	Let frantic Talbot triumph for a while
2421	And like a peacock sweep along his tail;
2422	We'll pull his plumes and take away his train,
2423	If Dauphin and the rest will be but ruled.
2424	
2425	CHARLES	We have been guided by thee hitherto,
2426	And of thy cunning had no diffidence:
2427	One sudden foil shall never breed distrust.
2428	
2429	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	Search out thy wit for secret policies,
2430	And we will make thee famous through the world.
2431	
2432	ALENCON	We'll set thy statue in some holy place,
2433	And have thee reverenced like a blessed saint:
2434	Employ thee then, sweet virgin, for our good.
2435	
2436	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Then thus it must be; this doth Joan devise:
2437	By fair persuasions mix'd with sugar'd words
2438	We will entice the Duke of Burgundy
2439	To leave the Talbot and to follow us.
2440	
2441	CHARLES	Ay, marry, sweeting, if we could do that,
2442	France were no place for Henry's warriors;
2443	Nor should that nation boast it so with us,
2444	But be extirped from our provinces.
2445	
2446	ALENCON	For ever should they be expulsed from France
2447	And not have title of an earldom here.
2448	
2449	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Your honours shall perceive how I will work
2450	To bring this matter to the wished end.
2451	
2452	[Drum sounds afar off]
2453	
2454	Hark! by the sound of drum you may perceive
2455	Their powers are marching unto Paris-ward.
2456	
2457	[Here sound an English march. Enter, and pass over
2458	at a distance, TALBOT and his forces]
2459	
2460	There goes the Talbot, with his colours spread,
2461	And all the troops of English after him.
2462	
2463	[French march. Enter BURGUNDY and forces]
2464	
2465	Now in the rearward comes the duke and his:
2466	Fortune in favour makes him lag behind.
2467	Summon a parley; we will talk with him.
2468	
2469	[Trumpets sound a parley]
2470	
2471	CHARLES	A parley with the Duke of Burgundy!
2472	
2473	BURGUNDY	Who craves a parley with the Burgundy?
2474	
2475	JOAN LA PUCELLE	The princely Charles of France, thy countryman.
2476	
2477	BURGUNDY	What say'st thou, Charles? for I am marching hence.
2478	
2479	CHARLES	Speak, Pucelle, and enchant him with thy words.
2480	
2481	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Brave Burgundy, undoubted hope of France!
2482	Stay, let thy humble handmaid speak to thee.
2483	
2484	BURGUNDY	Speak on; but be not over-tedious.
2485	
2486	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Look on thy country, look on fertile France,
2487	And see the cities and the towns defaced
2488	By wasting ruin of the cruel foe.
2489	As looks the mother on her lowly babe
2490	When death doth close his tender dying eyes,
2491	See, see the pining malady of France;
2492	Behold the wounds, the most unnatural wounds,
2493	Which thou thyself hast given her woful breast.
2494	O, turn thy edged sword another way;
2495	Strike those that hurt, and hurt not those that help.
2496	One drop of blood drawn from thy country's bosom
2497	Should grieve thee more than streams of foreign gore:
2498	Return thee therefore with a flood of tears,
2499	And wash away thy country's stained spots.
2500	
2501	BURGUNDY	Either she hath bewitch'd me with her words,
2502	Or nature makes me suddenly relent.
2503	
2504	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Besides, all French and France exclaims on thee,
2505	Doubting thy birth and lawful progeny.
2506	Who joint'st thou with but with a lordly nation
2507	That will not trust thee but for profit's sake?
2508	When Talbot hath set footing once in France
2509	And fashion'd thee that instrument of ill,
2510	Who then but English Henry will be lord
2511	And thou be thrust out like a fugitive?
2512	Call we to mind, and mark but this for proof,
2513	Was not the Duke of Orleans thy foe?
2514	And was he not in England prisoner?
2515	But when they heard he was thine enemy,
2516	They set him free without his ransom paid,
2517	In spite of Burgundy and all his friends.
2518	See, then, thou fight'st against thy countrymen
2519	And joint'st with them will be thy slaughtermen.
2520	Come, come, return; return, thou wandering lord:
2521	Charles and the rest will take thee in their arms.
2522	
2523	BURGUNDY	I am vanquished; these haughty words of hers
2524	Have batter'd me like roaring cannon-shot,
2525	And made me almost yield upon my knees.
2526	Forgive me, country, and sweet countrymen,
2527	And, lords, accept this hearty kind embrace:
2528	My forces and my power of men are yours:
2529	So farewell, Talbot; I'll no longer trust thee.
2530	
2531	JOAN LA PUCELLE	[Aside]  Done like a Frenchman: turn, and turn again!
2532	
2533	CHARLES	Welcome, brave duke! thy friendship makes us fresh.
2534	
2535	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	And doth beget new courage in our breasts.
2536	
2537	ALENCON	Pucelle hath bravely play'd her part in this,
2538	And doth deserve a coronet of gold.
2539	
2540	CHARLES	Now let us on, my lords, and join our powers,
2541	And seek how we may prejudice the foe.

2562	
2563	TALBOT	My gracious prince, and honourable peers,
2564	Hearing of your arrival in this realm,
2565	I have awhile given truce unto my wars,
2566	To do my duty to my sovereign:
2567	In sign, whereof, this arm, that hath reclaim'd
2568	To your obedience fifty fortresses,
2569	Twelve cities and seven walled towns of strength,
2570	Beside five hundred prisoners of esteem,
2571	Lets fall his sword before your highness' feet,

2579	That hath so long been resident in France?
2580	
2581	GLOUCESTER	Yes, if it please your majesty, my liege.
2582	
2583	KING HENRY VI	Welcome, brave captain and victorious lord!
2584	When I was young, as yet I am not old,
2585	I do remember how my father said
2586	A stouter champion never handled sword.
2587	Long since we were resolved of your truth,
2588	Your faithful service and your toil in war;
2589	Yet never have you tasted our reward,
2590	Or been reguerdon'd with so much as thanks,
2591	Because till now we never saw your face:
2592	Therefore, stand up; and, for these good deserts,
2593	We here create you Earl of Shrewsbury;
2594	And in our coronation take your place.
2595	
2596	[Sennet. Flourish. Exeunt all but VERNON and BASSET]
2597	
2598	VERNON	Now, sir, to you, that were so hot at sea,
2599	Disgracing of these colours that I wear
2600	In honour of my noble Lord of York:
2601	Darest thou maintain the former words thou spakest?
2602	
2603	BASSET	Yes, sir; as well as you dare patronage
2604	The envious barking of your saucy tongue
2605	Against my lord the Duke of Somerset.
2606	
2607	VERNON	Sirrah, thy lord I honour as he is.
2608	
2609	BASSET	Why, what is he? as good a man as York.
2610	
2611	VERNON	Hark ye; not so: in witness, take ye that.
2612	
2613	[Strikes him]
2614	
2615	BASSET	Villain, thou know'st the law of arms is such
2616	That whoso draws a sword, 'tis present death,
2617	Or else this blow should broach thy dearest blood.
2618	But I'll unto his majesty, and crave
2619	I may have liberty to venge this wrong;
2620	When thou shalt see I'll meet thee to thy cost.
2621

2647	OF WINCHESTER	God save King Henry, of that name the sixth!
2648

2657	
2658	FASTOLFE	My gracious sovereign, as I rode from Calais,
2659	To haste unto your coronation,
2660	A letter was deliver'd to my hands,
2661	Writ to your grace from the Duke of Burgundy.
2662	
2663	TALBOT	Shame to the Duke of Burgundy and thee!
2664	I vow'd, base knight, when I did meet thee next,
2665	To tear the garter from thy craven's leg,
2666	
2667	[Plucking it off]
2668	
2669	Which I have done, because unworthily
2670	Thou wast installed in that high degree.
2671	Pardon me, princely Henry, and the rest
2672	This dastard, at the battle of Patay,
2673	When but in all I was six thousand strong
2674	And that the French were almost ten to one,
2675	Before we met or that a stroke was given,
2676	Like to a trusty squire did run away:
2677	In which assault we lost twelve hundred men;
2678	Myself and divers gentlemen beside
2679	Were there surprised and taken prisoners.
2680	Then judge, great lords, if I have done amiss;
2681	Or whether that such cowards ought to wear
2682	This ornament of knighthood, yea or no.
2683	
2684	GLOUCESTER	To say the truth, this fact was infamous
2685	And ill beseeming any common man,
2686	Much more a knight, a captain and a leader.
2687	
2688	TALBOT	When first this order was ordain'd, my lords,
2689	Knights of the garter were of noble birth,
2690	Valiant and virtuous, full of haughty courage,
2691	Such as were grown to credit by the wars;
2692	Not fearing death, nor shrinking for distress,
2693	But always resolute in most extremes.
2694	He then that is not furnish'd in this sort
2695	Doth but usurp the sacred name of knight,
2696	Profaning this most honourable order,
2697	And should, if I were worthy to be judge,
2698	Be quite degraded, like a hedge-born swain
2699	That doth presume to boast of gentle blood.
2700	
2701	KING HENRY VI	Stain to thy countrymen, thou hear'st thy doom!
2702	Be packing, therefore, thou that wast a knight:
2703	Henceforth we banish thee, on pain of death.
2704	
2705	[Exit FASTOLFE]
2706	
2707	And now, my lord protector, view the letter
2708	Sent from our uncle Duke of Burgundy.
2709	
2710	GLOUCESTER	What means his grace, that he hath changed his style?
2711	No more but, plain and bluntly, 'To the king!'
2712	Hath he forgot he is his sovereign?
2713	Or doth this churlish superscription
2714	Pretend some alteration in good will?
2715	What's here?
2716	
2717	[Reads]
2718	
2719	'I have, upon especial cause,
2720	Moved with compassion of my country's wreck,
2721	Together with the pitiful complaints
2722	Of such as your oppression feeds upon,
2723	Forsaken your pernicious faction
2724	And join'd with Charles, the rightful King of France.'
2725	O monstrous treachery! can this be so,
2726	That in alliance, amity and oaths,
2727	There should be found such false dissembling guile?
2728	
2729	KING HENRY VI	What! doth my uncle Burgundy revolt?
2730	
2731	GLOUCESTER	He doth, my lord, and is become your foe.
2732	
2733	KING HENRY VI	Is that the worst this letter doth contain?
2734	
2735	GLOUCESTER	It is the worst, and all, my lord, he writes.
2736	
2737	KING HENRY VI	Why, then, Lord Talbot there shall talk with him
2738	And give him chastisement for this abuse.
2739	How say you, my lord? are you not content?
2740	
2741	TALBOT	Content, my liege! yes, but that I am prevented,
2742	I should have begg'd I might have been employ'd.
2743	
2744	KING HENRY VI	Then gather strength and march unto him straight:
2745	Let him perceive how ill we brook his treason
2746	And what offence it is to flout his friends.
2747	
2748	TALBOT	I go, my lord, in heart desiring still
2749	You may behold confusion of your foes.
2750	
2751	[Exit]
2752	
2753	[Enter VERNON and BASSET]
2754	
2755	VERNON	Grant me the combat, gracious sovereign.
2756	
2757	BASSET	And me, my lord, grant me the combat too.
2758	
2759	YORK	This is my servant: hear him, noble prince.
2760	
2761	SOMERSET	And this is mine: sweet Henry, favour him.
2762	
2763	KING HENRY VI	Be patient, lords; and give them leave to speak.
2764	Say, gentlemen, what makes you thus exclaim?
2765	And wherefore crave you combat? or with whom?
2766	
2767	VERNON	With him, my lord; for he hath done me wrong.
2768	
2769	BASSET	And I with him; for he hath done me wrong.
2770	
2771	KING HENRY VI	What is that wrong whereof you both complain?
2772	First let me know, and then I'll answer you.
2773	
2774	BASSET	Crossing the sea from England into France,
2775	This fellow here, with envious carping tongue,
2776	Upbraided me about the rose I wear;
2777	Saying, the sanguine colour of the leaves
2778	Did represent my master's blushing cheeks,
2779	When stubbornly he did repugn the truth
2780	About a certain question in the law
2781	Argued betwixt the Duke of York and him;
2782	With other vile and ignominious terms:
2783	In confutation of which rude reproach
2784	And in defence of my lord's worthiness,
2785	I crave the benefit of law of arms.
2786	
2787	VERNON	And that is my petition, noble lord:
2788	For though he seem with forged quaint conceit
2789	To set a gloss upon his bold intent,
2790	Yet know, my lord, I was provoked by him;
2791	And he first took exceptions at this badge,
2792	Pronouncing that the paleness of this flower
2793	Bewray'd the faintness of my master's heart.
2794	
2795	YORK	Will not this malice, Somerset, be left?
2796	
2797	SOMERSET	Your private grudge, my Lord of York, will out,
2798	Though ne'er so cunningly you smother it.
2799	
2800	KING HENRY VI	Good Lord, what madness rules in brainsick men,
2801	When for so slight and frivolous a cause
2802	Such factious emulations shall arise!
2803	Good cousins both, of York and Somerset,
2804	Quiet yourselves, I pray, and be at peace.
2805	
2806	YORK	Let this dissension first be tried by fight,
2807	And then your highness shall command a peace.
2808	
2809	SOMERSET	The quarrel toucheth none but us alone;
2810	Betwixt ourselves let us decide it then.
2811	
2812	YORK	There is my pledge; accept it, Somerset.
2813	
2814	VERNON	Nay, let it rest where it began at first.
2815	
2816	BASSET	Confirm it so, mine honourable lord.
2817	
2818	GLOUCESTER	Confirm it so! Confounded be your strife!
2819	And perish ye, with your audacious prate!
2820	Presumptuous vassals, are you not ashamed
2821	With this immodest clamorous outrage
2822	To trouble and disturb the king and us?
2823	And you, my lords, methinks you do not well
2824	To bear with their perverse objections;
2825	Much less to take occasion from their mouths
2826	To raise a mutiny betwixt yourselves:
2827	Let me persuade you take a better course.
2828	
2829	EXETER	It grieves his highness: good my lords, be friends.
2830	
2831	KING HENRY VI	Come hither, you that would be combatants:
2832	Henceforth I charge you, as you love our favour,
2833	Quite to forget this quarrel and the cause.
2834	And you, my lords, remember where we are,
2835	In France, amongst a fickle wavering nation:
2836	If they perceive dissension in our looks
2837	And that within ourselves we disagree,
2838	How will their grudging stomachs be provoked
2839	To wilful disobedience, and rebel!
2840	Beside, what infamy will there arise,
2841	When foreign princes shall be certified
2842	That for a toy, a thing of no regard,
2843	King Henry's peers and chief nobility
2844	Destroy'd themselves, and lost the realm of France!
2845	O, think upon the conquest of my father,
2846	My tender years, and let us not forego
2847	That for a trifle that was bought with blood
2848	Let me be umpire in this doubtful strife.
2849	I see no reason, if I wear this rose,
2850	
2851	[Putting on a red rose]
2852	
2853	That any one should therefore be suspicious
2854	I more incline to Somerset than York:
2855	Both are my kinsmen, and I love them both:
2856	As well they may upbraid me with my crown,
2857	Because, forsooth, the king of Scots is crown'd.
2858	But your discretions better can persuade
2859	Than I am able to instruct or teach:
2860	And therefore, as we hither came in peace,
2861	So let us still continue peace and love.
2862	Cousin of York, we institute your grace
2863	To be our regent in these parts of France:
2864	And, good my Lord of Somerset, unite
2865	Your troops of horsemen with his bands of foot;
2866	And, like true subjects, sons of your progenitors,
2867	Go cheerfully together and digest.
2868	Your angry choler on your enemies.
2869	Ourself, my lord protector and the rest
2870	After some respite will return to Calais;
2871	From thence to England; where I hope ere long
2872	To be presented, by your victories,
2873	With Charles, Alencon and that traitorous rout.
2874	
2875	[Flourish. Exeunt all but YORK, WARWICK, EXETER
2876	and VERNON]
2877	
2878	WARWICK	My Lord of York, I promise you, the king
2879	Prettily, methought, did play the orator.
2880	
2881	YORK	And so he did; but yet I like it not,
2882	In that he wears the badge of Somerset.
2883	
2884	WARWICK	Tush, that was but his fancy, blame him not;
2885	I dare presume, sweet prince, he thought no harm.
2886	
2887	YORK	An if I wist he did,--but let it rest;
2888	Other affairs must now be managed.
2889	
2890	[Exeunt all but EXETER]
2891	
2892	EXETER	Well didst thou, Richard, to suppress thy voice;
2893	For, had the passions of thy heart burst out,
2894	I fear we should have seen decipher'd there
2895	More rancorous spite, more furious raging broils,
2896	Than yet can be imagined or supposed.
2897	But howsoe'er, no simple man that sees
2898	This jarring discord of nobility,
2899	This shouldering of each other in the court,
2900	This factious bandying of their favourites,
2901	But that it doth presage some ill event.
2902	'Tis much when sceptres are in children's hands;
2903	But more when envy breeds unkind division;
2904	There comes the rain, there begins confusion.

2923	TALBOT	Go to the gates of Bourdeaux, trumpeter:
2924	Summon their general unto the wall.
2925	
2926	[Trumpet sounds. Enter General and others, aloft]
2927	
2928	English John Talbot, captains, calls you forth,
2929	Servant in arms to Harry King of England;
2930	And thus he would: Open your city gates;
2931	Be humble to us; call my sovereign yours,
2932	And do him homage as obedient subjects;
2933	And I'll withdraw me and my bloody power:
2934	But, if you frown upon this proffer'd peace,
2935	You tempt the fury of my three attendants,
2936	Lean famine, quartering steel, and climbing fire;
2937	Who in a moment even with the earth
2938	Shall lay your stately and air-braving towers,
2939	If you forsake the offer of their love.
2940	
2941	General	Thou ominous and fearful owl of death,
2942	Our nation's terror and their bloody scourge!
2943	The period of thy tyranny approacheth.
2944	On us thou canst not enter but by death;
2945	For, I protest, we are well fortified
2946	And strong enough to issue out and fight:
2947	If thou retire, the Dauphin, well appointed,
2948	Stands with the snares of war to tangle thee:
2949	On either hand thee there are squadrons pitch'd,
2950	To wall thee from the liberty of flight;
2951	And no way canst thou turn thee for redress,
2952	But death doth front thee with apparent spoil
2953	And pale destruction meets thee in the face.
2954	Ten thousand French have ta'en the sacrament
2955	To rive their dangerous artillery
2956	Upon no Christian soul but English Talbot.
2957	Lo, there thou stand'st, a breathing valiant man,
2958	Of an invincible unconquer'd spirit!
2959	This is the latest glory of thy praise
2960	That I, thy enemy, due thee withal;
2961	For ere the glass, that now begins to run,
2962	Finish the process of his sandy hour,
2963	These eyes, that see thee now well coloured,
2964	Shall see thee wither'd, bloody, pale and dead.
2965	
2966	[Drum afar off]
2967	
2968	Hark! hark! the Dauphin's drum, a warning bell,
2969	Sings heavy music to thy timorous soul;
2970	And mine shall ring thy dire departure out.
2971	
2972	[Exeunt General, &c]

2974	TALBOT	He fables not; I hear the enemy:
2975	Out, some light horsemen, and peruse their wings.
2976	O, negligent and heedless discipline!
2977	How are we park'd and bounded in a pale,
2978	A little herd of England's timorous deer,
2979	Mazed with a yelping kennel of French curs!
2980	If we be English deer, be then in blood;
2981	Not rascal-like, to fall down with a pinch,
2982	But rather, moody-mad and desperate stags,
2983	Turn on the bloody hounds with heads of steel
2984	And make the cowards stand aloof at bay:
2985	Sell every man his life as dear as mine,
2986	And they shall find dear deer of us, my friends.

3010	
3011	Messenger	They are return'd, my lord, and give it out
3012	That he is march'd to Bourdeaux with his power,
3013	To fight with Talbot: as he march'd along,
3014	By your espials were discovered
3015	Two mightier troops than that the Dauphin led,
3016	Which join'd with him and made their march for Bourdeaux.

3019	That thus delays my promised supply
3020	Of horsemen, that were levied for this siege!

3031	Spur to the rescue of the noble Talbot,
3032	Who now is girdled with a waist of iron
3033	And hemm'd about with grim destruction:
3034	To Bourdeaux, warlike duke! to Bourdeaux, York!
3035	Else, farewell Talbot, France, and England's honour.
3036	
3037	YORK	O God, that Somerset, who in proud heart
3038	Doth stop my cornets, were in Talbot's place!
3039	So should we save a valiant gentleman
3040	By forfeiting a traitor and a coward.
3041	Mad ire and wrathful fury makes me weep,
3042	That thus we die, while remiss traitors sleep.
3043	
3044	LUCY	O, send some succor to the distress'd lord!
3045	
3046	YORK	He dies, we lose; I break my warlike word;
3047	We mourn, France smiles; we lose, they daily get;
3048	All 'long of this vile traitor Somerset.
3049	
3050	LUCY	Then God take mercy on brave Talbot's soul;
3051	And on his son young John, who two hours since
3052	I met in travel toward his warlike father!
3053	This seven years did not Talbot see his son;
3054	And now they meet where both their lives are done.
3055	
3056	YORK	Alas, what joy shall noble Talbot have
3057	To bid his young son welcome to his grave?
3058	Away! vexation almost stops my breath,
3059	That sunder'd friends greet in the hour of death.
3060	Lucy, farewell; no more my fortune can,
3061	But curse the cause I cannot aid the man.

3093	SOMERSET	It is too late; I cannot send them now:
3094	This expedition was by York and Talbot
3095	Too rashly plotted: all our general force
3096	Might with a sally of the very town
3097	Be buckled with: the over-daring Talbot
3098	Hath sullied all his gloss of former honour
3099	By this unheedful, desperate, wild adventure:

3114	And whiles the honourable captain there
3115	Drops bloody sweat from his war-wearied limbs,
3116	And, in advantage lingering, looks for rescue,
3117	You, his false hopes, the trust of England's honour,

3132	
3133	SOMERSET	York lies; he might have sent and had the horse;
3134	I owe him little duty, and less love;

3171	To tutor thee in stratagems of war,
3172	That Talbot's name might be in thee revived
3173	When sapless age and weak unable limbs
3174	Should bring thy father to his drooping chair.
3175	But, O malignant and ill-boding stars!
3176	Now thou art come unto a feast of death,
3177	A terrible and unavoided danger:
3178	Therefore, dear boy, mount on my swiftest horse;
3179	And I'll direct thee how thou shalt escape
3180	By sudden flight: come, dally not, be gone.
3181	
3182	JOHN TALBOT	Is my name Talbot? and am I your son?
3183	And shall I fly? O if you love my mother,
3184	Dishonour not her honourable name,
3185	To make a bastard and a slave of me!
3186	The world will say, he is not Talbot's blood,
3187	That basely fled when noble Talbot stood.
3188	
3189	TALBOT	Fly, to revenge my death, if I be slain.
3190	
3191	JOHN TALBOT	He that flies so will ne'er return again.
3192	
3193	TALBOT	If we both stay, we both are sure to die.
3194	
3195	JOHN TALBOT	Then let me stay; and, father, do you fly:
3196	Your loss is great, so your regard should be;
3197	My worth unknown, no loss is known in me.
3198	Upon my death the French can little boast;
3199	In yours they will, in you all hopes are lost.
3200	Flight cannot stain the honour you have won;
3201	But mine it will, that no exploit have done:
3202	You fled for vantage, everyone will swear;
3203	But, if I bow, they'll say it was for fear.
3204	There is no hope that ever I will stay,
3205	If the first hour I shrink and run away.
3206	Here on my knee I beg mortality,
3207	Rather than life preserved with infamy.
3208	
3209	TALBOT	Shall all thy mother's hopes lie in one tomb?
3210	
3211	JOHN TALBOT	Ay, rather than I'll shame my mother's womb.
3212	
3213	TALBOT	Upon my blessing, I command thee go.

3222	
3223	JOHN TALBOT	Yes, your renowned name: shall flight abuse it?
3224	
3225	TALBOT	Thy father's charge shall clear thee from that stain.

3228	If death be so apparent, then both fly.

3231	My age was never tainted with such shame.
3232	
3233	JOHN TALBOT	And shall my youth be guilty of such blame?
3234	No more can I be sever'd from your side,
3235	Than can yourself yourself in twain divide:
3236	Stay, go, do what you will, the like do I;
3237	For live I will not, if my father die.

3260	hemmed about, and TALBOT rescues him]
3261	
3262	TALBOT	Saint George and victory! fight, soldiers, fight.
3263	The regent hath with Talbot broke his word
3264	And left us to the rage of France his sword.
3265	Where is John Talbot? Pause, and take thy breath;
3266	I gave thee life and rescued thee from death.
3267	
3268	JOHN TALBOT	O, twice my father, twice am I thy son!
3269	The life thou gavest me first was lost and done,
3270	Till with thy warlike sword, despite of late,
3271	To my determined time thou gavest new date.
3272	
3273	TALBOT	When from the Dauphin's crest thy sword struck fire,
3274	It warm'd thy father's heart with proud desire
3275	Of bold-faced victory. Then leaden age,
3276	Quicken'd with youthful spleen and warlike rage,
3277	Beat down Alencon, Orleans, Burgundy,
3278	And from the pride of Gallia rescued thee.
3279	The ireful bastard Orleans, that drew blood
3280	From thee, my boy, and had the maidenhood
3281	Of thy first fight, I soon encountered,
3282	And interchanging blows I quickly shed
3283	Some of his bastard blood; and in disgrace
3284	Bespoke him thus; 'Contaminated, base
3285	And misbegotten blood I spill of thine,
3286	Mean and right poor, for that pure blood of mine
3287	Which thou didst force from Talbot, my brave boy:'
3288	Here, purposing the Bastard to destroy,
3289	Came in strong rescue. Speak, thy father's care,
3290	Art thou not weary, John? how dost thou fare?
3291	Wilt thou yet leave the battle, boy, and fly,
3292	Now thou art seal'd the son of chivalry?
3293	Fly, to revenge my death when I am dead:
3294	The help of one stands me in little stead.
3295	O, too much folly is it, well I wot,
3296	To hazard all our lives in one small boat!
3297	If I to-day die not with Frenchmen's rage,
3298	To-morrow I shall die with mickle age:
3299	By me they nothing gain an if I stay;
3300	'Tis but the shortening of my life one day:
3301	In thee thy mother dies, our household's name,
3302	My death's revenge, thy youth, and England's fame:
3303	All these and more we hazard by thy stay;
3304	All these are saved if thou wilt fly away.
3305	
3306	JOHN TALBOT	The sword of Orleans hath not made me smart;
3307	These words of yours draw life-blood from my heart:
3308	On that advantage, bought with such a shame,
3309	To save a paltry life and slay bright fame,
3310	Before young Talbot from old Talbot fly,
3311	The coward horse that bears me fail and die!
3312	And like me to the peasant boys of France,
3313	To be shame's scorn and subject of mischance!
3314	Surely, by all the glory you have won,
3315	An if I fly, I am not Talbot's son:
3316	Then talk no more of flight, it is no boot;
3317	If son to Talbot, die at Talbot's foot.
3318	
3319	TALBOT	Then follow thou thy desperate sire of Crete,
3320	Thou Icarus; thy life to me is sweet:
3321	If thou wilt fight, fight by thy father's side;
3322	And, commendable proved, let's die in pride.

3343	Triumphant death, smear'd with captivity,
3344	Young Talbot's valour makes me smile at thee:
3345	When he perceived me shrink and on my knee,
3346	His bloody sword he brandish'd over me,
3347	And, like a hungry lion, did commence
3348	Rough deeds of rage and stern impatience;
3349	But when my angry guardant stood alone,
3350	Tendering my ruin and assail'd of none,
3351	Dizzy-eyed fury and great rage of heart
3352	Suddenly made him from my side to start
3353	Into the clustering battle of the French;
3354	And in that sea of blood my boy did drench
3355	His over-mounting spirit, and there died,
3356	My Icarus, my blossom, in his pride.

3364	Coupled in bonds of perpetuity,
3365	Two Talbots, winged through the lither sky,
3366	In thy despite shall 'scape mortality.
3367	O, thou, whose wounds become hard-favour'd death,
3368	Speak to thy father ere thou yield thy breath!
3369	Brave death by speaking, whether he will or no;
3370	Imagine him a Frenchman and thy foe.
3371	Poor boy! he smiles, methinks, as who should say,
3372	Had death been French, then death had died to-day.
3373	Come, come and lay him in his father's arms:
3374	My spirit can no longer bear these harms.

3385	
3386	BASTARD OF ORLEANS	How the young whelp of Talbot's, raging-wood,
3387	Did flesh his puny sword in Frenchmen's blood!
3388	
3389	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Once I encounter'd him, and thus I said:
3390	'Thou maiden youth, be vanquish'd by a maid:'
3391	But, with a proud majestical high scorn,
3392	He answer'd thus: 'Young Talbot was not born
3393	To be the pillage of a giglot wench:'
3394	So, rushing in the bowels of the French,
3395	He left me proudly, as unworthy fight.
3396	
3397	BURGUNDY	Doubtless he would have made a noble knight;
3398	See, where he lies inhearsed in the arms
3399	Of the most bloody nurser of his harms!

3418	And to survey the bodies of the dead.

3425	Created, for his rare success in arms,

3439	Him that thou magnifiest with all these titles
3440	Stinking and fly-blown lies here at our feet.
3441	
3442	LUCY	Is Talbot slain, the Frenchmen's only scourge,
3443	Your kingdom's terror and black Nemesis?
3444	O, were mine eyeballs into bullets turn'd,
3445	That I in rage might shoot them at your faces!
3446	O, that I could but call these dead to life!
3447	It were enough to fright the realm of France:
3448	Were but his picture left amongst you here,
3449	It would amaze the proudest of you all.
3450	Give me their bodies, that I may bear them hence
3451	And give them burial as beseems their worth.
3452	
3453	JOAN LA PUCELLE	I think this upstart is old Talbot's ghost,
3454	He speaks with such a proud commanding spirit.
3455	For God's sake let him have 'em; to keep them here,
3456	They would but stink, and putrefy the air.

3495	To stop effusion of our Christian blood
3496	And 'stablish quietness on every side.
3497	
3498	KING HENRY VI	Ay, marry, uncle; for I always thought

3757	MARGARET	Why speak'st thou not? what ransom must I pay?
3758	
3759	SUFFOLK	She's beautiful, and therefore to be woo'd;
3760	She is a woman, therefore to be won.
3761	
3762	MARGARET	Wilt thou accept of ransom? yea, or no.
3763	
3764	SUFFOLK	Fond man, remember that thou hast a wife;
3765	Then how can Margaret be thy paramour?
3766	
3767	MARGARET	I were best to leave him, for he will not hear.
3768	
3769	SUFFOLK	There all is marr'd; there lies a cooling card.
3770	
3771	MARGARET	He talks at random; sure, the man is mad.
3772	
3773	SUFFOLK	And yet a dispensation may be had.
3774	
3775	MARGARET	And yet I would that you would answer me.
3776	
3777	SUFFOLK	I'll win this Lady Margaret. For whom?
3778	Why, for my king: tush, that's a wooden thing!
3779	
3780	MARGARET	He talks of wood: it is some carpenter.
3781	
3782	SUFFOLK	Yet so my fancy may be satisfied,
3783	And peace established between these realms
3784	But there remains a scruple in that too;
3785	For though her father be the King of Naples,
3786	Duke of Anjou and Maine, yet is he poor,
3787	And our nobility will scorn the match.
3788	
3789	MARGARET	Hear ye, captain, are you not at leisure?
3790	
3791	SUFFOLK	It shall be so, disdain they ne'er so much.
3792	Henry is youthful and will quickly yield.
3793	Madam, I have a secret to reveal.
3794	
3795	MARGARET	What though I be enthrall'd? he seems a knight,
3796	And will not any way dishonour me.
3797	
3798	SUFFOLK	Lady, vouchsafe to listen what I say.
3799	
3800	MARGARET	Perhaps I shall be rescued by the French;
3801	And then I need not crave his courtesy.
3802	
3803	SUFFOLK	Sweet madam, give me a hearing in a cause--
3804	
3805	MARGARET	Tush, women have been captivate ere now.
3806	
3807	SUFFOLK	Lady, wherefore talk you so?
3808	
3809	MARGARET	I cry you mercy, 'tis but Quid for Quo.
3810	
3811	SUFFOLK	Say, gentle princess, would you not suppose
3812	Your bondage happy, to be made a queen?
3813	
3814	MARGARET	To be a queen in bondage is more vile
3815	Than is a slave in base servility;
3816	For princes should be free.
3817	
3818	SUFFOLK	And so shall you,
3819	If happy England's royal king be free.
3820	
3821	MARGARET	Why, what concerns his freedom unto me?
3822	
3823	SUFFOLK	I'll undertake to make thee Henry's queen,
3824	To put a golden sceptre in thy hand
3825	And set a precious crown upon thy head,
3826	If thou wilt condescend to be my--
3827	
3828	MARGARET	What?
3829	
3830	SUFFOLK	His love.
3831	
3832	MARGARET	I am unworthy to be Henry's wife.
3833	
3834	SUFFOLK	No, gentle madam; I unworthy am
3835	To woo so fair a dame to be his wife,
3836	And have no portion in the choice myself.
3837	How say you, madam, are ye so content?
3838	
3839	MARGARET	An if my father please, I am content.
3840	
3841	SUFFOLK	Then call our captains and our colours forth.
3842	And, madam, at your father's castle walls
3843	We'll crave a parley, to confer with him.
3844	
3845	[A parley sounded. Enter REIGNIER on the walls]
3846	
3847	See, Reignier, see, thy daughter prisoner!
3848	
3849	REIGNIER	To whom?
3850	
3851	SUFFOLK	       To me.
3852	
3853	REIGNIER	                  Suffolk, what remedy?
3854	I am a soldier, and unapt to weep,
3855	Or to exclaim on fortune's fickleness.
3856	
3857	SUFFOLK	Yes, there is remedy enough, my lord:
3858	Consent, and for thy honour give consent,
3859	Thy daughter shall be wedded to my king;
3860	Whom I with pain have woo'd and won thereto;
3861	And this her easy-held imprisonment
3862	Hath gained thy daughter princely liberty.
3863	
3864	REIGNIER	Speaks Suffolk as he thinks?
3865	
3866	SUFFOLK	Fair Margaret knows
3867	That Suffolk doth not flatter, face, or feign.
3868	
3869	REIGNIER	Upon thy princely warrant, I descend
3870	To give thee answer of thy just demand.
3871	
3872	[Exit from the walls]
3873	
3874	SUFFOLK	And here I will expect thy coming.
3875	
3876	[Trumpets sound. Enter REIGNIER, below]
3877	
3878	REIGNIER	Welcome, brave earl, into our territories:
3879	Command in Anjou what your honour pleases.
3880	
3881	SUFFOLK	Thanks, Reignier, happy for so sweet a child,
3882	Fit to be made companion with a king:
3883	What answer makes your grace unto my suit?
3884	
3885	REIGNIER	Since thou dost deign to woo her little worth
3886	To be the princely bride of such a lord;
3887	Upon condition I may quietly
3888	Enjoy mine own, the country Maine and Anjou,
3889	Free from oppression or the stroke of war,
3890	My daughter shall be Henry's, if he please.
3891	
3892	SUFFOLK	That is her ransom; I deliver her;
3893	And those two counties I will undertake
3894	Your grace shall well and quietly enjoy.
3895	
3896	REIGNIER	And I again, in Henry's royal name,
3897	As deputy unto that gracious king,
3898	Give thee her hand, for sign of plighted faith.
3899	
3900	SUFFOLK	Reignier of France, I give thee kingly thanks,
3901	Because this is in traffic of a king.
3902	
3903	[Aside]
3904	
3905	And yet, methinks, I could be well content
3906	To be mine own attorney in this case.
3907	I'll over then to England with this news,
3908	And make this marriage to be solemnized.
3909	So farewell, Reignier: set this diamond safe
3910	In golden palaces, as it becomes.
3911	
3912	REIGNIER	I do embrace thee, as I would embrace
3913	The Christian prince, King Henry, were he here.
3914	
3915	MARGARET	Farewell, my lord: good wishes, praise and prayers
3916	Shall Suffolk ever have of Margaret.
3917	
3918	[Going]
3919	
3920	SUFFOLK	Farewell, sweet madam: but hark you, Margaret;
3921	No princely commendations to my king?
3922	
3923	MARGARET	Such commendations as becomes a maid,
3924	A virgin and his servant, say to him.
3925	
3926	SUFFOLK	Words sweetly placed and modestly directed.
3927	But madam, I must trouble you again;
3928	No loving token to his majesty?
3929	
3930	MARGARET	Yes, my good lord, a pure unspotted heart,
3931	Never yet taint with love, I send the king.
3932	
3933	SUFFOLK	And this withal.
3934	
3935	[Kisses her]
3936	
3937	MARGARET	That for thyself: I will not so presume
3938	To send such peevish tokens to a king.
3939	
3940	[Exeunt REIGNIER and MARGARET]
3941	
3942	SUFFOLK	O, wert thou for myself! But, Suffolk, stay;
3943	Thou mayst not wander in that labyrinth;
3944	There Minotaurs and ugly treasons lurk.
3945	Solicit Henry with her wondrous praise:
3946	Bethink thee on her virtues that surmount,
3947	And natural graces that extinguish art;
3948	Repeat their semblance often on the seas,
3949	That, when thou comest to kneel at Henry's feet,
3950	Thou mayst bereave him of his wits with wonder.
3951	
3952	[Exit]

3957	1 KING HENRY VI
3958	
3959	
3960	ACT V
3961	
3962	
3963	
3964	SCENE IV	Camp of the YORK in Anjou.
3965	
3966	
3967	[Enter YORK, WARWICK, and others]
3968	
3969	YORK	Bring forth that sorceress condemn'd to burn.
3970	
3971	[Enter JOAN LA PUCELLE, guarded, and a Shepherd]
3972	
3973	Shepherd	Ah, Joan, this kills thy father's heart outright!
3974	Have I sought every country far and near,
3975	And, now it is my chance to find thee out,
3976	Must I behold thy timeless cruel death?
3977	Ah, Joan, sweet daughter Joan, I'll die with thee!
3978	
3979	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Decrepit miser! base ignoble wretch!
3980	I am descended of a gentler blood:
3981	Thou art no father nor no friend of mine.
3982	
3983	Shepherd	Out, out! My lords, an please you, 'tis not so;
3984	I did beget her, all the parish knows:
3985	Her mother liveth yet, can testify
3986	She was the first fruit of my bachelorship.
3987	
3988	WARWICK	Graceless! wilt thou deny thy parentage?
3989	
3990	YORK	This argues what her kind of life hath been,
3991	Wicked and vile; and so her death concludes.
3992	
3993	Shepherd	Fie, Joan, that thou wilt be so obstacle!
3994	God knows thou art a collop of my flesh;
3995	And for thy sake have I shed many a tear:
3996	Deny me not, I prithee, gentle Joan.
3997	
3998	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Peasant, avaunt! You have suborn'd this man,
3999	Of purpose to obscure my noble birth.
4000	
4001	Shepherd	'Tis true, I gave a noble to the priest
4002	The morn that I was wedded to her mother.
4003	Kneel down and take my blessing, good my girl.
4004	Wilt thou not stoop? Now cursed be the time
4005	Of thy nativity! I would the milk
4006	Thy mother gave thee when thou suck'dst her breast,
4007	Had been a little ratsbane for thy sake!
4008	Or else, when thou didst keep my lambs a-field,
4009	I wish some ravenous wolf had eaten thee!
4010	Dost thou deny thy father, cursed drab?
4011	O, burn her, burn her! hanging is too good.
4012	
4013	[Exit]
4014	
4015	YORK	Take her away; for she hath lived too long,
4016	To fill the world with vicious qualities.
4017	
4018	JOAN LA PUCELLE	First, let me tell you whom you have condemn'd:
4019	Not me begotten of a shepherd swain,
4020	But issued from the progeny of kings;
4021	Virtuous and holy; chosen from above,
4022	By inspiration of celestial grace,
4023	To work exceeding miracles on earth.
4024	I never had to do with wicked spirits:
4025	But you, that are polluted with your lusts,
4026	Stain'd with the guiltless blood of innocents,
4027	Corrupt and tainted with a thousand vices,
4028	Because you want the grace that others have,
4029	You judge it straight a thing impossible
4030	To compass wonders but by help of devils.
4031	No, misconceived! Joan of Arc hath been
4032	A virgin from her tender infancy,
4033	Chaste and immaculate in very thought;
4034	Whose maiden blood, thus rigorously effused,
4035	Will cry for vengeance at the gates of heaven.
4036	
4037	YORK	Ay, ay: away with her to execution!
4038	
4039	WARWICK	And hark ye, sirs; because she is a maid,
4040	Spare for no faggots, let there be enow:
4041	Place barrels of pitch upon the fatal stake,
4042	That so her torture may be shortened.
4043	
4044	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Will nothing turn your unrelenting hearts?
4045	Then, Joan, discover thine infirmity,
4046	That warranteth by law to be thy privilege.
4047	I am with child, ye bloody homicides:
4048	Murder not then the fruit within my womb,
4049	Although ye hale me to a violent death.
4050	
4051	YORK	Now heaven forfend! the holy maid with child!
4052	
4053	WARWICK	The greatest miracle that e'er ye wrought:
4054	Is all your strict preciseness come to this?
4055	
4056	YORK	She and the Dauphin have been juggling:
4057	I did imagine what would be her refuge.
4058	
4059	WARWICK	Well, go to; we'll have no bastards live;
4060	Especially since Charles must father it.
4061	
4062	JOAN LA PUCELLE	You are deceived; my child is none of his:
4063	It was Alencon that enjoy'd my love.
4064	
4065	YORK	Alencon! that notorious Machiavel!
4066	It dies, an if it had a thousand lives.
4067	
4068	JOAN LA PUCELLE	O, give me leave, I have deluded you:
4069	'Twas neither Charles nor yet the duke I named,
4070	But Reignier, king of Naples, that prevail'd.
4071	
4072	WARWICK	A married man! that's most intolerable.
4073	
4074	YORK	Why, here's a girl! I think she knows not well,
4075	There were so many, whom she may accuse.
4076	
4077	WARWICK	It's sign she hath been liberal and free.
4078	
4079	YORK	And yet, forsooth, she is a virgin pure.
4080	Strumpet, thy words condemn thy brat and thee:
4081	Use no entreaty, for it is in vain.
4082	
4083	JOAN LA PUCELLE	Then lead me hence; with whom I leave my curse:
4084	May never glorious sun reflex his beams
4085	Upon the country where you make abode;
4086	But darkness and the gloomy shade of death
4087	Environ you, till mischief and despair
4088	Drive you to break your necks or hang yourselves!
4089	
4090	[Exit, guarded]
4091	
4092	YORK	Break thou in pieces and consume to ashes,
4093	Thou foul accursed minister of hell!
4094	
4095	[Enter CARDINAL OF WINCHESTER, attended]
4096	
4097	CARDINAL
4098	OF WINCHESTER	Lord regent, I do greet your excellence
4099	With letters of commission from the king.
4100	For know, my lords, the states of Christendom,
4101	Moved with remorse of these outrageous broils,
4102	Have earnestly implored a general peace
4103	Betwixt our nation and the aspiring French;
4104	And here at hand the Dauphin and his train
4105	Approacheth, to confer about some matter.
4106	
4107	YORK	 Is all our travail turn'd to this effect?
4108	After the slaughter of so many peers,
4109	So many captains, gentlemen and soldiers,
4110	That in this quarrel have been overthrown
4111	And sold their bodies for their country's benefit,
4112	Shall we at last conclude effeminate peace?
4113	Have we not lost most part of all the towns,
4114	By treason, falsehood and by treachery,
4115	Our great progenitors had conquered?
4116	O Warwick, Warwick! I foresee with grief
4117	The utter loss of all the realm of France.
4118	
4119	WARWICK	Be patient, York: if we conclude a peace,
4120	It shall be with such strict and severe covenants
4121	As little shall the Frenchmen gain thereby.
4122	
4123	[Enter CHARLES, ALENCON, BASTARD OF ORLEANS,
4124	REIGNIER, and others]
4125	
4126	CHARLES	Since, lords of England, it is thus agreed
4127	That peaceful truce shall be proclaim'd in France,
4128	We come to be informed by yourselves
4129	What the conditions of that league must be.
4130	
4131	YORK	Speak, Winchester; for boiling choler chokes
4132	The hollow passage of my poison'd voice,
4133	By sight of these our baleful enemies.
4134	
4135	CARDINAL
4136	OF WINCHESTER	Charles, and the rest, it is enacted thus:
4137	That, in regard King Henry gives consent,
4138	Of mere compassion and of lenity,
4139	To ease your country of distressful war,
4140	And suffer you to breathe in fruitful peace,
4141	You shall become true liegemen to his crown:
4142	And Charles, upon condition thou wilt swear
4143	To pay him tribute, submit thyself,
4144	Thou shalt be placed as viceroy under him,
4145	And still enjoy thy regal dignity.
4146	
4147	ALENCON	Must he be then as shadow of himself?
4148	Adorn his temples with a coronet,
4149	And yet, in substance and authority,
4150	Retain but privilege of a private man?
4151	This proffer is absurd and reasonless.
4152	
4153	CHARLES	'Tis known already that I am possess'd
4154	With more than half the Gallian territories,
4155	And therein reverenced for their lawful king:
4156	Shall I, for lucre of the rest unvanquish'd,
4157	Detract so much from that prerogative,
4158	As to be call'd but viceroy of the whole?
4159	No, lord ambassador, I'll rather keep
4160	That which I have than, coveting for more,
4161	Be cast from possibility of all.
4162	
4163	YORK	Insulting Charles! hast thou by secret means
4164	Used intercession to obtain a league,
4165	And, now the matter grows to compromise,
4166	Stand'st thou aloof upon comparison?
4167	Either accept the title thou usurp'st,
4168	Of benefit proceeding from our king
4169	And not of any challenge of desert,
4170	Or we will plague thee with incessant wars.
4171	
4172	REIGNIER	My lord, you do not well in obstinacy
4173	To cavil in the course of this contract:
4174	If once it be neglected, ten to one
4175	We shall not find like opportunity.
4176	
4177	ALENCON	To say the truth, it is your policy
4178	To save your subjects from such massacre
4179	And ruthless slaughters as are daily seen
4180	By our proceeding in hostility;
4181	And therefore take this compact of a truce,
4182	Although you break it when your pleasure serves.
4183	
4184	WARWICK	How say'st thou, Charles? shall our condition stand?
4185	
4186	CHARLES	It shall;
4187	Only reserved, you claim no interest
4188	In any of our towns of garrison.
4189	
4190	YORK	Then swear allegiance to his majesty,
4191	As thou art knight, never to disobey
4192	Nor be rebellious to the crown of England,
4193	Thou, nor thy nobles, to the crown of England.
4194	So, now dismiss your army when ye please:
4195	Hang up your ensign, let your drums be still,
4196	For here we entertain a solemn peace.
4197	
4198	[Exeunt]

4204	
4205	
4206	ACT V
4207	
4208	
4209	
4210	SCENE V	London. The palace.
4211	
4212	
4213	[Enter SUFFOLK in conference with KING HENRY VI,
4214	GLOUCESTER and EXETER]
4215	
4216	KING HENRY VI	Your wondrous rare description, noble earl,
4217	Of beauteous Margaret hath astonish'd me:
4218	Her virtues graced with external gifts
4219	Do breed love's settled passions in my heart:
4220	And like as rigor of tempestuous gusts
4221	Provokes the mightiest hulk against the tide,
4222	So am I driven by breath of her renown
4223	Either to suffer shipwreck or arrive
4224	Where I may have fruition of her love.
4225	
4226	SUFFOLK	Tush, my good lord, this superficial tale
4227	Is but a preface of her worthy praise;
4228	The chief perfections of that lovely dame
4229	Had I sufficient skill to utter them,
4230	Would make a volume of enticing lines,
4231	Able to ravish any dull conceit:
4232	And, which is more, she is not so divine,
4233	So full-replete with choice of all delights,
4234	But with as humble lowliness of mind
4235	She is content to be at your command;
4236	Command, I mean, of virtuous chaste intents,
4237	To love and honour Henry as her lord.
4238	
4239	KING HENRY VI	And otherwise will Henry ne'er presume.
4240	Therefore, my lord protector, give consent
4241	That Margaret may be England's royal queen.
4242	
4243	GLOUCESTER	So should I give consent to flatter sin.
4244	You know, my lord, your highness is betroth'd
4245	Unto another lady of esteem:
4246	How shall we then dispense with that contract,
4247	And not deface your honour with reproach?
4248	
4249	SUFFOLK	As doth a ruler with unlawful oaths;
4250	Or one that, at a triumph having vow'd
4251	To try his strength, forsaketh yet the lists
4252	By reason of his adversary's odds:
4253	A poor earl's daughter is unequal odds,
4254	And therefore may be broke without offence.
4255	
4256	GLOUCESTER	Why, what, I pray, is Margaret more than that?
4257	Her father is no better than an earl,
4258	Although in glorious titles he excel.
4259	
4260	SUFFOLK	Yes, lord, her father is a king,
4261	The King of Naples and Jerusalem;
4262	And of such great authority in France
4263	As his alliance will confirm our peace
4264	And keep the Frenchmen in allegiance.
4265	
4266	GLOUCESTER	And so the Earl of Armagnac may do,
4267	Because he is near kinsman unto Charles.
4268	
4269	EXETER	Beside, his wealth doth warrant a liberal dower,
4270	Where Reignier sooner will receive than give.
4271	
4272	SUFFOLK	A dower, my lords! disgrace not so your king,
4273	That he should be so abject, base and poor,
4274	To choose for wealth and not for perfect love.
4275	Henry is able to enrich his queen
4276	And not seek a queen to make him rich:
4277	So worthless peasants bargain for their wives,
4278	As market-men for oxen, sheep, or horse.
4279	Marriage is a matter of more worth
4280	Than to be dealt in by attorneyship;
4281	Not whom we will, but whom his grace affects,
4282	Must be companion of his nuptial bed:
4283	And therefore, lords, since he affects her most,
4284	It most of all these reasons bindeth us,
4285	In our opinions she should be preferr'd.
4286	For what is wedlock forced but a hell,
4287	An age of discord and continual strife?
4288	Whereas the contrary bringeth bliss,
4289	And is a pattern of celestial peace.
4290	Whom should we match with Henry, being a king,
4291	But Margaret, that is daughter to a king?
4292	Her peerless feature, joined with her birth,
4293	Approves her fit for none but for a king:
4294	Her valiant courage and undaunted spirit,
4295	More than in women commonly is seen,
4296	Will answer our hope in issue of a king;
4297	For Henry, son unto a conqueror,
4298	Is likely to beget more conquerors,
4299	If with a lady of so high resolve
4300	As is fair Margaret he be link'd in love.
4301	Then yield, my lords; and here conclude with me
4302	That Margaret shall be queen, and none but she.
4303	
4304	KING HENRY VI	Whether it be through force of your report,
4305	My noble Lord of Suffolk, or for that
4306	My tender youth was never yet attaint
4307	With any passion of inflaming love,
4308	I cannot tell; but this I am assured,
4309	I feel such sharp dissension in my breast,
4310	Such fierce alarums both of hope and fear,
4311	As I am sick with working of my thoughts.
4312	Take, therefore, shipping; post, my lord, to France;
4313	Agree to any covenants, and procure
4314	That Lady Margaret do vouchsafe to come
4315	To cross the seas to England and be crown'd
4316	King Henry's faithful and anointed queen:
4317	For your expenses and sufficient charge,
4318	Among the people gather up a tenth.
4319	Be gone, I say; for, till you do return,
4320	I rest perplexed with a thousand cares.
4321	And you, good uncle, banish all offence:
4322	If you do censure me by what you were,
4323	Not what you are, I know it will excuse
4324	This sudden execution of my will.
4325	And so, conduct me where, from company,
4326	I may revolve and ruminate my grief.
4327	
4328	[Exit]
4329	
4330	GLOUCESTER	Ay, grief, I fear me, both at first and last.
4331	
4332	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and EXETER]
4333	
4334	SUFFOLK	Thus Suffolk hath prevail'd; and thus he goes,
4335	As did the youthful Paris once to Greece,
4336	With hope to find the like event in love,
4337	But prosper better than the Trojan did.
4338	Margaret shall now be queen, and rule the king;
4339	But I will rule both her, the king and realm.
4340	
4341	[Exit]

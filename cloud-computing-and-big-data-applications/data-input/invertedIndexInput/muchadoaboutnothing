61	
62	
63	SCENE I	Before LEONATO'S house.
64	
65	
66	[Enter LEONATO, HERO, and BEATRICE, with a
67	Messenger]
68	
69	LEONATO	I learn in this letter that Don Peter of Arragon
70	comes this night to Messina.
71	
72	Messenger	He is very near by this: he was not three leagues off
73	when I left him.
74	
75	LEONATO	How many gentlemen have you lost in this action?
76	
77	Messenger	But few of any sort, and none of name.
78	
79	LEONATO	A victory is twice itself when the achiever brings
80	home full numbers. I find here that Don Peter hath
81	bestowed much honour on a young Florentine called Claudio.
82	
83	Messenger	Much deserved on his part and equally remembered by
84	Don Pedro: he hath borne himself beyond the
85	promise of his age, doing, in the figure of a lamb,
86	the feats of a lion: he hath indeed better
87	bettered expectation than you must expect of me to
88	tell you how.
89	
90	LEONATO	He hath an uncle here in Messina will be very much
91	glad of it.
92	
93	Messenger	I have already delivered him letters, and there
94	appears much joy in him; even so much that joy could
95	not show itself modest enough without a badge of
96	bitterness.
97	
98	LEONATO	Did he break out into tears?
99	
100	Messenger	In great measure.
101	
102	LEONATO	A kind overflow of kindness: there are no faces
103	truer than those that are so washed. How much
104	better is it to weep at joy than to joy at weeping!
105	
106	BEATRICE	I pray you, is Signior Mountanto returned from the
107	wars or no?
108	
109	Messenger	I know none of that name, lady: there was none such
110	in the army of any sort.
111	
112	LEONATO	What is he that you ask for, niece?
113	
114	HERO	My cousin means Signior Benedick of Padua.
115	
116	Messenger	O, he's returned; and as pleasant as ever he was.
117	
118	BEATRICE	He set up his bills here in Messina and challenged
119	Cupid at the flight; and my uncle's fool, reading
120	the challenge, subscribed for Cupid, and challenged
121	him at the bird-bolt. I pray you, how many hath he
122	killed and eaten in these wars? But how many hath
123	he killed? for indeed I promised to eat all of his killing.
124	
125	LEONATO	Faith, niece, you tax Signior Benedick too much;
126	but he'll be meet with you, I doubt it not.
127	
128	Messenger	He hath done good service, lady, in these wars.
129	
130	BEATRICE	You had musty victual, and he hath holp to eat it:
131	he is a very valiant trencherman; he hath an
132	excellent stomach.
133	
134	Messenger	And a good soldier too, lady.
135	
136	BEATRICE	And a good soldier to a lady: but what is he to a lord?
137	
138	Messenger	A lord to a lord, a man to a man; stuffed with all
139	honourable virtues.
140	
141	BEATRICE	It is so, indeed; he is no less than a stuffed man:
142	but for the stuffing,--well, we are all mortal.
143	
144	LEONATO	You must not, sir, mistake my niece. There is a
145	kind of merry war betwixt Signior Benedick and her:
146	they never meet but there's a skirmish of wit
147	between them.
148	
149	BEATRICE	Alas! he gets nothing by that. In our last
150	conflict four of his five wits went halting off, and
151	now is the whole man governed with one: so that if
152	he have wit enough to keep himself warm, let him
153	bear it for a difference between himself and his
154	horse; for it is all the wealth that he hath left,
155	to be known a reasonable creature. Who is his
156	companion now? He hath every month a new sworn brother.
157	
158	Messenger	Is't possible?
159	
160	BEATRICE	Very easily possible: he wears his faith but as
161	the fashion of his hat; it ever changes with the
162	next block.
163	
164	Messenger	I see, lady, the gentleman is not in your books.
165	
166	BEATRICE	No; an he were, I would burn my study. But, I pray
167	you, who is his companion? Is there no young
168	squarer now that will make a voyage with him to the devil?
169	
170	Messenger	He is most in the company of the right noble Claudio.
171	
172	BEATRICE	O Lord, he will hang upon him like a disease: he
173	is sooner caught than the pestilence, and the taker
174	runs presently mad. God help the noble Claudio! if
175	he have caught the Benedick, it will cost him a
176	thousand pound ere a' be cured.
177	
178	Messenger	I will hold friends with you, lady.
179	
180	BEATRICE	Do, good friend.
181	
182	LEONATO	You will never run mad, niece.
183	
184	BEATRICE	No, not till a hot January.
185	
186	Messenger	Don Pedro is approached.
187	
188	[Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK,
189	and BALTHASAR]
190	
191	DON PEDRO	Good Signior Leonato, you are come to meet your
192	trouble: the fashion of the world is to avoid
193	cost, and you encounter it.
194	
195	LEONATO	Never came trouble to my house in the likeness of
196	your grace: for trouble being gone, comfort should
197	remain; but when you depart from me, sorrow abides
198	and happiness takes his leave.
199	
200	DON PEDRO	You embrace your charge too willingly. I think this
201	is your daughter.
202	
203	LEONATO	Her mother hath many times told me so.
204	
205	BENEDICK	Were you in doubt, sir, that you asked her?
206	
207	LEONATO	Signior Benedick, no; for then were you a child.
208	
209	DON PEDRO	You have it full, Benedick: we may guess by this
210	what you are, being a man. Truly, the lady fathers
211	herself. Be happy, lady; for you are like an
212	honourable father.
213	
214	BENEDICK	If Signior Leonato be her father, she would not
215	have his head on her shoulders for all Messina, as
216	like him as she is.
217	
218	BEATRICE	I wonder that you will still be talking, Signior
219	Benedick: nobody marks you.
220	
221	BENEDICK	What, my dear Lady Disdain! are you yet living?
222	
223	BEATRICE	Is it possible disdain should die while she hath
224	such meet food to feed it as Signior Benedick?
225	Courtesy itself must convert to disdain, if you come
226	in her presence.
227	
228	BENEDICK	Then is courtesy a turncoat. But it is certain I
229	am loved of all ladies, only you excepted: and I
230	would I could find in my heart that I had not a hard
231	heart; for, truly, I love none.
232	
233	BEATRICE	A dear happiness to women: they would else have
234	been troubled with a pernicious suitor. I thank God
235	and my cold blood, I am of your humour for that: I
236	had rather hear my dog bark at a crow than a man
237	swear he loves me.
238	
239	BENEDICK	God keep your ladyship still in that mind! so some
240	gentleman or other shall 'scape a predestinate
241	scratched face.
242	
243	BEATRICE	Scratching could not make it worse, an 'twere such
244	a face as yours were.
245	
246	BENEDICK	Well, you are a rare parrot-teacher.
247	
248	BEATRICE	A bird of my tongue is better than a beast of yours.
249	
250	BENEDICK	I would my horse had the speed of your tongue, and
251	so good a continuer. But keep your way, i' God's
252	name; I have done.
253	
254	BEATRICE	You always end with a jade's trick: I know you of old.
255	
256	DON PEDRO	That is the sum of all, Leonato. Signior Claudio
257	and Signior Benedick, my dear friend Leonato hath
258	invited you all. I tell him we shall stay here at
259	the least a month; and he heartily prays some
260	occasion may detain us longer. I dare swear he is no
261	hypocrite, but prays from his heart.
262	
263	LEONATO	If you swear, my lord, you shall not be forsworn.
264	
265	[To DON JOHN]
266	
267	Let me bid you welcome, my lord: being reconciled to
268	the prince your brother, I owe you all duty.
269	
270	DON JOHN	I thank you: I am not of many words, but I thank
271	you.
272	
273	LEONATO	Please it your grace lead on?
274	
275	DON PEDRO	Your hand, Leonato; we will go together.
276	
277	[Exeunt all except BENEDICK and CLAUDIO]
278	
279	CLAUDIO	Benedick, didst thou note the daughter of Signior Leonato?
280	
281	BENEDICK	I noted her not; but I looked on her.
282	
283	CLAUDIO	Is she not a modest young lady?
284	
285	BENEDICK	Do you question me, as an honest man should do, for
286	my simple true judgment; or would you have me speak
287	after my custom, as being a professed tyrant to their sex?
288	
289	CLAUDIO	No; I pray thee speak in sober judgment.
290	
291	BENEDICK	Why, i' faith, methinks she's too low for a high
292	praise, too brown for a fair praise and too little
293	for a great praise: only this commendation I can
294	afford her, that were she other than she is, she
295	were unhandsome; and being no other but as she is, I
296	do not like her.
297	
298	CLAUDIO	Thou thinkest I am in sport: I pray thee tell me
299	truly how thou likest her.
300	
301	BENEDICK	Would you buy her, that you inquire after her?
302	
303	CLAUDIO	Can the world buy such a jewel?
304	
305	BENEDICK	Yea, and a case to put it into. But speak you this
306	with a sad brow? or do you play the flouting Jack,
307	to tell us Cupid is a good hare-finder and Vulcan a
308	rare carpenter? Come, in what key shall a man take
309	you, to go in the song?
310	
311	CLAUDIO	In mine eye she is the sweetest lady that ever I
312	looked on.
313	
314	BENEDICK	I can see yet without spectacles and I see no such
315	matter: there's her cousin, an she were not
316	possessed with a fury, exceeds her as much in beauty
317	as the first of May doth the last of December. But I
318	hope you have no intent to turn husband, have you?
319	
320	CLAUDIO	I would scarce trust myself, though I had sworn the
321	contrary, if Hero would be my wife.
322	
323	BENEDICK	Is't come to this? In faith, hath not the world
324	one man but he will wear his cap with suspicion?
325	Shall I never see a bachelor of three-score again?
326	Go to, i' faith; an thou wilt needs thrust thy neck
327	into a yoke, wear the print of it and sigh away
328	Sundays. Look Don Pedro is returned to seek you.
329	
330	[Re-enter DON PEDRO]
331	
332	DON PEDRO	What secret hath held you here, that you followed
333	not to Leonato's?
334	
335	BENEDICK	I would your grace would constrain me to tell.
336	
337	DON PEDRO	I charge thee on thy allegiance.
338	
339	BENEDICK	You hear, Count Claudio: I can be secret as a dumb
340	man; I would have you think so; but, on my
341	allegiance, mark you this, on my allegiance. He is
342	in love. With who? now that is your grace's part.
343	Mark how short his answer is;--With Hero, Leonato's
344	short daughter.
345	
346	CLAUDIO	If this were so, so were it uttered.
347	
348	BENEDICK	Like the old tale, my lord: 'it is not so, nor
349	'twas not so, but, indeed, God forbid it should be
350	so.'
351	
352	CLAUDIO	If my passion change not shortly, God forbid it
353	should be otherwise.
354	
355	DON PEDRO	Amen, if you love her; for the lady is very well worthy.
356	
357	CLAUDIO	You speak this to fetch me in, my lord.
358	
359	DON PEDRO	By my troth, I speak my thought.
360	
361	CLAUDIO	And, in faith, my lord, I spoke mine.
362	
363	BENEDICK	And, by my two faiths and troths, my lord, I spoke mine.
364	
365	CLAUDIO	That I love her, I feel.
366	
367	DON PEDRO	That she is worthy, I know.
368	
369	BENEDICK	That I neither feel how she should be loved nor
370	know how she should be worthy, is the opinion that
371	fire cannot melt out of me: I will die in it at the stake.
372	
373	DON PEDRO	Thou wast ever an obstinate heretic in the despite
374	of beauty.
375	
376	CLAUDIO	And never could maintain his part but in the force
377	of his will.
378	
379	BENEDICK	That a woman conceived me, I thank her; that she
380	brought me up, I likewise give her most humble
381	thanks: but that I will have a recheat winded in my
382	forehead, or hang my bugle in an invisible baldrick,
383	all women shall pardon me. Because I will not do
384	them the wrong to mistrust any, I will do myself the
385	right to trust none; and the fine is, for the which
386	I may go the finer, I will live a bachelor.
387	
388	DON PEDRO	I shall see thee, ere I die, look pale with love.
389	
390	BENEDICK	With anger, with sickness, or with hunger, my lord,
391	not with love: prove that ever I lose more blood
392	with love than I will get again with drinking, pick
393	out mine eyes with a ballad-maker's pen and hang me
394	up at the door of a brothel-house for the sign of
395	blind Cupid.
396	
397	DON PEDRO	Well, if ever thou dost fall from this faith, thou
398	wilt prove a notable argument.
399	
400	BENEDICK	If I do, hang me in a bottle like a cat and shoot
401	at me; and he that hits me, let him be clapped on
402	the shoulder, and called Adam.
403	
404	DON PEDRO	Well, as time shall try: 'In time the savage bull
405	doth bear the yoke.'
406	
407	BENEDICK	The savage bull may; but if ever the sensible
408	Benedick bear it, pluck off the bull's horns and set
409	them in my forehead: and let me be vilely painted,
410	and in such great letters as they write 'Here is
411	good horse to hire,' let them signify under my sign
412	'Here you may see Benedick the married man.'
413	
414	CLAUDIO	If this should ever happen, thou wouldst be horn-mad.
415	
416	DON PEDRO	Nay, if Cupid have not spent all his quiver in
417	Venice, thou wilt quake for this shortly.
418	
419	BENEDICK	I look for an earthquake too, then.
420	
421	DON PEDRO	Well, you temporize with the hours. In the
422	meantime, good Signior Benedick, repair to
423	Leonato's: commend me to him and tell him I will
424	not fail him at supper; for indeed he hath made
425	great preparation.
426	
427	BENEDICK	I have almost matter enough in me for such an
428	embassage; and so I commit you--
429	
430	CLAUDIO	To the tuition of God: From my house, if I had it,--
431	
432	DON PEDRO	The sixth of July: Your loving friend, Benedick.
433	
434	BENEDICK	Nay, mock not, mock not. The body of your
435	discourse is sometime guarded with fragments, and
436	the guards are but slightly basted on neither: ere
437	you flout old ends any further, examine your
438	conscience: and so I leave you.
439	
440	[Exit]
441	
442	CLAUDIO	My liege, your highness now may do me good.
443	
444	DON PEDRO	My love is thine to teach: teach it but how,
445	And thou shalt see how apt it is to learn
446	Any hard lesson that may do thee good.
447	
448	CLAUDIO	Hath Leonato any son, my lord?
449	
450	DON PEDRO	No child but Hero; she's his only heir.
451	Dost thou affect her, Claudio?
452	
453	CLAUDIO	O, my lord,
454	When you went onward on this ended action,
455	I look'd upon her with a soldier's eye,
456	That liked, but had a rougher task in hand
457	Than to drive liking to the name of love:
458	But now I am return'd and that war-thoughts
459	Have left their places vacant, in their rooms
460	Come thronging soft and delicate desires,
461	All prompting me how fair young Hero is,
462	Saying, I liked her ere I went to wars.
463	
464	DON PEDRO	Thou wilt be like a lover presently
465	And tire the hearer with a book of words.
466	If thou dost love fair Hero, cherish it,
467	And I will break with her and with her father,
468	And thou shalt have her. Was't not to this end
469	That thou began'st to twist so fine a story?
470	
471	CLAUDIO	How sweetly you do minister to love,
472	That know love's grief by his complexion!
473	But lest my liking might too sudden seem,
474	I would have salved it with a longer treatise.
475	
476	DON PEDRO	What need the bridge much broader than the flood?
477	The fairest grant is the necessity.
478	Look, what will serve is fit: 'tis once, thou lovest,
479	And I will fit thee with the remedy.
480	I know we shall have revelling to-night:
481	I will assume thy part in some disguise
482	And tell fair Hero I am Claudio,
483	And in her bosom I'll unclasp my heart
484	And take her hearing prisoner with the force
485	And strong encounter of my amorous tale:
486	Then after to her father will I break;
487	And the conclusion is, she shall be thine.
488	In practise let us put it presently.

502	SCENE II	A room in LEONATO's house.
503	
504	
505	[Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, meeting]
506	
507	LEONATO	How now, brother! Where is my cousin, your son?
508	hath he provided this music?
509	
510	ANTONIO	He is very busy about it. But, brother, I can tell
511	you strange news that you yet dreamt not of.
512	
513	LEONATO	Are they good?
514	
515	ANTONIO	As the event stamps them: but they have a good
516	cover; they show well outward. The prince and Count
517	Claudio, walking in a thick-pleached alley in mine
518	orchard, were thus much overheard by a man of mine:
519	the prince discovered to Claudio that he loved my
520	niece your daughter and meant to acknowledge it
521	this night in a dance: and if he found her
522	accordant, he meant to take the present time by the
523	top and instantly break with you of it.
524	
525	LEONATO	Hath the fellow any wit that told you this?
526	
527	ANTONIO	A good sharp fellow: I will send for him; and
528	question him yourself.
529	
530	LEONATO	No, no; we will hold it as a dream till it appear
531	itself: but I will acquaint my daughter withal,
532	that she may be the better prepared for an answer,
533	if peradventure this be true. Go you and tell her of it.
534	
535	[Enter Attendants]
536	
537	Cousins, you know what you have to do. O, I cry you
538	mercy, friend; go you with me, and I will use your
539	skill. Good cousin, have a care this busy time.

553	SCENE III	The same.
554	
555	
556	[Enter DON JOHN and CONRADE]
557	
558	CONRADE	What the good-year, my lord! why are you thus out
559	of measure sad?
560	
561	DON JOHN	There is no measure in the occasion that breeds;
562	therefore the sadness is without limit.
563	
564	CONRADE	You should hear reason.
565	
566	DON JOHN	And when I have heard it, what blessing brings it?
567	
568	CONRADE	If not a present remedy, at least a patient
569	sufferance.
570	
571	DON JOHN	I wonder that thou, being, as thou sayest thou art,
572	born under Saturn, goest about to apply a moral
573	medicine to a mortifying mischief. I cannot hide
574	what I am: I must be sad when I have cause and smile
575	at no man's jests, eat when I have stomach and wait
576	for no man's leisure, sleep when I am drowsy and
577	tend on no man's business, laugh when I am merry and
578	claw no man in his humour.
579	
580	CONRADE	Yea, but you must not make the full show of this
581	till you may do it without controlment. You have of
582	late stood out against your brother, and he hath
583	ta'en you newly into his grace; where it is
584	impossible you should take true root but by the
585	fair weather that you make yourself: it is needful
586	that you frame the season for your own harvest.
587	
588	DON JOHN	I had rather be a canker in a hedge than a rose in
589	his grace, and it better fits my blood to be
590	disdained of all than to fashion a carriage to rob
591	love from any: in this, though I cannot be said to
592	be a flattering honest man, it must not be denied
593	but I am a plain-dealing villain. I am trusted with
594	a muzzle and enfranchised with a clog; therefore I
595	have decreed not to sing in my cage. If I had my
596	mouth, I would bite; if I had my liberty, I would do
597	my liking: in the meantime let me be that I am and
598	seek not to alter me.
599	
600	CONRADE	Can you make no use of your discontent?
601	
602	DON JOHN	I make all use of it, for I use it only.
603	Who comes here?
604	
605	[Enter BORACHIO]
606	
607	What news, Borachio?
608	
609	BORACHIO	I came yonder from a great supper: the prince your
610	brother is royally entertained by Leonato: and I
611	can give you intelligence of an intended marriage.
612	
613	DON JOHN	Will it serve for any model to build mischief on?
614	What is he for a fool that betroths himself to
615	unquietness?
616	
617	BORACHIO	Marry, it is your brother's right hand.
618	
619	DON JOHN	Who? the most exquisite Claudio?
620	
621	BORACHIO	Even he.
622	
623	DON JOHN	A proper squire! And who, and who? which way looks
624	he?
625	
626	BORACHIO	Marry, on Hero, the daughter and heir of Leonato.
627	
628	DON JOHN	A very forward March-chick! How came you to this?
629	
630	BORACHIO	Being entertained for a perfumer, as I was smoking a
631	musty room, comes me the prince and Claudio, hand
632	in hand in sad conference: I whipt me behind the
633	arras; and there heard it agreed upon that the
634	prince should woo Hero for himself, and having
635	obtained her, give her to Count Claudio.
636	
637	DON JOHN	Come, come, let us thither: this may prove food to
638	my displeasure. That young start-up hath all the
639	glory of my overthrow: if I can cross him any way, I
640	bless myself every way. You are both sure, and will assist me?
641	
642	CONRADE	To the death, my lord.
643	
644	DON JOHN	Let us to the great supper: their cheer is the
645	greater that I am subdued. Would the cook were of
646	my mind! Shall we go prove what's to be done?
647	
648	BORACHIO	We'll wait upon your lordship.
649	
650	[Exeunt]
651	
652	
653	
654	
655	MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING
656	
657	
658	ACT II
659	
660	
661	
662	SCENE I	A hall in LEONATO'S house.
663	
664	
665	[Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, HERO, BEATRICE, and others]
666	
667	
668	LEONATO	Was not Count John here at supper?
669	
670	ANTONIO	I saw him not.
671	
672	BEATRICE	How tartly that gentleman looks! I never can see
673	him but I am heart-burned an hour after.
674	
675	HERO	He is of a very melancholy disposition.
676	
677	BEATRICE	He were an excellent man that were made just in the
678	midway between him and Benedick: the one is too
679	like an image and says nothing, and the other too
680	like my lady's eldest son, evermore tattling.
681	
682	LEONATO	Then half Signior Benedick's tongue in Count John's
683	mouth, and half Count John's melancholy in Signior
684	Benedick's face,--
685	
686	BEATRICE	With a good leg and a good foot, uncle, and money
687	enough in his purse, such a man would win any woman
688	in the world, if a' could get her good-will.
689	
690	LEONATO	By my troth, niece, thou wilt never get thee a
691	husband, if thou be so shrewd of thy tongue.
692	
693	ANTONIO	In faith, she's too curst.
694	
695	BEATRICE	Too curst is more than curst: I shall lessen God's
696	sending that way; for it is said, 'God sends a curst
697	cow short horns;' but to a cow too curst he sends none.
698	
699	LEONATO	So, by being too curst, God will send you no horns.
700	
701	BEATRICE	Just, if he send me no husband; for the which
702	blessing I am at him upon my knees every morning and
703	evening. Lord, I could not endure a husband with a
704	beard on his face: I had rather lie in the woollen.
705	
706	LEONATO	You may light on a husband that hath no beard.
707	
708	BEATRICE	What should I do with him? dress him in my apparel
709	and make him my waiting-gentlewoman? He that hath a
710	beard is more than a youth, and he that hath no
711	beard is less than a man: and he that is more than
712	a youth is not for me, and he that is less than a
713	man, I am not for him: therefore, I will even take
714	sixpence in earnest of the bear-ward, and lead his
715	apes into hell.
716	
717	LEONATO	Well, then, go you into hell?
718	
719	BEATRICE	No, but to the gate; and there will the devil meet
720	me, like an old cuckold, with horns on his head, and
721	say 'Get you to heaven, Beatrice, get you to
722	heaven; here's no place for you maids:' so deliver
723	I up my apes, and away to Saint Peter for the
724	heavens; he shows me where the bachelors sit, and
725	there live we as merry as the day is long.
726	
727	ANTONIO	[To HERO]  Well, niece, I trust you will be ruled
728	by your father.
729	
730	BEATRICE	Yes, faith; it is my cousin's duty to make curtsy
731	and say 'Father, as it please you.' But yet for all
732	that, cousin, let him be a handsome fellow, or else
733	make another curtsy and say 'Father, as it please
734	me.'
735	
736	LEONATO	Well, niece, I hope to see you one day fitted with a husband.
737	
738	BEATRICE	Not till God make men of some other metal than
739	earth. Would it not grieve a woman to be
740	overmastered with a pierce of valiant dust? to make
741	an account of her life to a clod of wayward marl?
742	No, uncle, I'll none: Adam's sons are my brethren;
743	and, truly, I hold it a sin to match in my kindred.
744	
745	LEONATO	Daughter, remember what I told you: if the prince
746	do solicit you in that kind, you know your answer.
747	
748	BEATRICE	The fault will be in the music, cousin, if you be
749	not wooed in good time: if the prince be too
750	important, tell him there is measure in every thing
751	and so dance out the answer. For, hear me, Hero:
752	wooing, wedding, and repenting, is as a Scotch jig,
753	a measure, and a cinque pace: the first suit is hot
754	and hasty, like a Scotch jig, and full as
755	fantastical; the wedding, mannerly-modest, as a
756	measure, full of state and ancientry; and then comes
757	repentance and, with his bad legs, falls into the
758	cinque pace faster and faster, till he sink into his grave.
759	
760	LEONATO	Cousin, you apprehend passing shrewdly.
761	
762	BEATRICE	I have a good eye, uncle; I can see a church by daylight.
763	
764	LEONATO	The revellers are entering, brother: make good room.
765	
766	[All put on their masks]
767	
768	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, BALTHASAR,
769	DON JOHN, BORACHIO, MARGARET, URSULA and others, masked]
770	
771	DON PEDRO	Lady, will you walk about with your friend?
772	
773	HERO	So you walk softly and look sweetly and say nothing,
774	I am yours for the walk; and especially when I walk away.
775	
776	DON PEDRO	With me in your company?
777	
778	HERO	I may say so, when I please.
779	
780	DON PEDRO	And when please you to say so?
781	
782	HERO	When I like your favour; for God defend the lute
783	should be like the case!
784	
785	DON PEDRO	My visor is Philemon's roof; within the house is Jove.
786	
787	HERO	Why, then, your visor should be thatched.
788	
789	DON PEDRO	Speak low, if you speak love.
790	
791	[Drawing her aside]
792	
793	BALTHASAR	Well, I would you did like me.
794	
795	MARGARET	So would not I, for your own sake; for I have many
796	ill-qualities.
797	
798	BALTHASAR	Which is one?
799	
800	MARGARET	I say my prayers aloud.
801	
802	BALTHASAR	I love you the better: the hearers may cry, Amen.
803	
804	MARGARET	God match me with a good dancer!
805	
806	BALTHASAR	Amen.
807	
808	MARGARET	And God keep him out of my sight when the dance is
809	done! Answer, clerk.
810	
811	BALTHASAR	No more words: the clerk is answered.
812	
813	URSULA	I know you well enough; you are Signior Antonio.
814	
815	ANTONIO	At a word, I am not.
816	
817	URSULA	I know you by the waggling of your head.
818	
819	ANTONIO	To tell you true, I counterfeit him.
820	
821	URSULA	You could never do him so ill-well, unless you were
822	the very man. Here's his dry hand up and down: you
823	are he, you are he.
824	
825	ANTONIO	At a word, I am not.
826	
827	URSULA	Come, come, do you think I do not know you by your
828	excellent wit? can virtue hide itself? Go to,
829	mum, you are he: graces will appear, and there's an
830	end.
831	
832	BEATRICE	Will you not tell me who told you so?
833	
834	BENEDICK	No, you shall pardon me.
835	
836	BEATRICE	Nor will you not tell me who you are?
837	
838	BENEDICK	Not now.
839	
840	BEATRICE	That I was disdainful, and that I had my good wit
841	out of the 'Hundred Merry Tales:'--well this was
842	Signior Benedick that said so.
843	
844	BENEDICK	What's he?
845	
846	BEATRICE	I am sure you know him well enough.
847	
848	BENEDICK	Not I, believe me.
849	
850	BEATRICE	Did he never make you laugh?
851	
852	BENEDICK	I pray you, what is he?
853	
854	BEATRICE	Why, he is the prince's jester: a very dull fool;
855	only his gift is in devising impossible slanders:
856	none but libertines delight in him; and the
857	commendation is not in his wit, but in his villany;
858	for he both pleases men and angers them, and then
859	they laugh at him and beat him. I am sure he is in
860	the fleet: I would he had boarded me.
861	
862	BENEDICK	When I know the gentleman, I'll tell him what you say.
863	
864	BEATRICE	Do, do: he'll but break a comparison or two on me;
865	which, peradventure not marked or not laughed at,
866	strikes him into melancholy; and then there's a
867	partridge wing saved, for the fool will eat no
868	supper that night.
869	
870	[Music]
871	
872	We must follow the leaders.
873	
874	BENEDICK	In every good thing.
875	
876	BEATRICE	Nay, if they lead to any ill, I will leave them at
877	the next turning.
878	
879	[Dance. Then exeunt all except DON JOHN, BORACHIO,
880	and CLAUDIO]
881	
882	DON JOHN	Sure my brother is amorous on Hero and hath
883	withdrawn her father to break with him about it.
884	The ladies follow her and but one visor remains.
885	
886	BORACHIO	And that is Claudio: I know him by his bearing.
887	
888	DON JOHN	Are not you Signior Benedick?
889	
890	CLAUDIO	You know me well; I am he.
891	
892	DON JOHN	Signior, you are very near my brother in his love:
893	he is enamoured on Hero; I pray you, dissuade him
894	from her: she is no equal for his birth: you may
895	do the part of an honest man in it.
896	
897	CLAUDIO	How know you he loves her?
898	
899	DON JOHN	I heard him swear his affection.
900	
901	BORACHIO	So did I too; and he swore he would marry her to-night.
902	
903	DON JOHN	Come, let us to the banquet.
904	
905	[Exeunt DON JOHN and BORACHIO]
906	
907	CLAUDIO	Thus answer I in the name of Benedick,
908	But hear these ill news with the ears of Claudio.
909	'Tis certain so; the prince wooes for himself.
910	Friendship is constant in all other things
911	Save in the office and affairs of love:
912	Therefore, all hearts in love use their own tongues;
913	Let every eye negotiate for itself
914	And trust no agent; for beauty is a witch
915	Against whose charms faith melteth into blood.
916	This is an accident of hourly proof,
917	Which I mistrusted not. Farewell, therefore, Hero!
918	
919	[Re-enter BENEDICK]
920	
921	BENEDICK	Count Claudio?
922	
923	CLAUDIO	Yea, the same.
924	
925	BENEDICK	Come, will you go with me?
926	
927	CLAUDIO	Whither?
928	
929	BENEDICK	Even to the next willow, about your own business,
930	county. What fashion will you wear the garland of?
931	about your neck, like an usurer's chain? or under
932	your arm, like a lieutenant's scarf? You must wear
933	it one way, for the prince hath got your Hero.
934	
935	CLAUDIO	I wish him joy of her.
936	
937	BENEDICK	Why, that's spoken like an honest drovier: so they
938	sell bullocks. But did you think the prince would
939	have served you thus?
940	
941	CLAUDIO	I pray you, leave me.
942	
943	BENEDICK	Ho! now you strike like the blind man: 'twas the
944	boy that stole your meat, and you'll beat the post.
945	
946	CLAUDIO	If it will not be, I'll leave you.
947	
948	[Exit]
949	
950	BENEDICK	Alas, poor hurt fowl! now will he creep into sedges.
951	But that my Lady Beatrice should know me, and not
952	know me! The prince's fool! Ha? It may be I go
953	under that title because I am merry. Yea, but so I
954	am apt to do myself wrong; I am not so reputed: it
955	is the base, though bitter, disposition of Beatrice
956	that puts the world into her person and so gives me
957	out. Well, I'll be revenged as I may.
958	
959	[Re-enter DON PEDRO]
960	
961	DON PEDRO	Now, signior, where's the count? did you see him?
962	
963	BENEDICK	Troth, my lord, I have played the part of Lady Fame.
964	I found him here as melancholy as a lodge in a
965	warren: I told him, and I think I told him true,
966	that your grace had got the good will of this young
967	lady; and I offered him my company to a willow-tree,
968	either to make him a garland, as being forsaken, or
969	to bind him up a rod, as being worthy to be whipped.
970	
971	DON PEDRO	To be whipped! What's his fault?
972	
973	BENEDICK	The flat transgression of a schoolboy, who, being
974	overjoyed with finding a birds' nest, shows it his
975	companion, and he steals it.
976	
977	DON PEDRO	Wilt thou make a trust a transgression? The
978	transgression is in the stealer.
979	
980	BENEDICK	Yet it had not been amiss the rod had been made,
981	and the garland too; for the garland he might have
982	worn himself, and the rod he might have bestowed on
983	you, who, as I take it, have stolen his birds' nest.
984	
985	DON PEDRO	I will but teach them to sing, and restore them to
986	the owner.
987	
988	BENEDICK	If their singing answer your saying, by my faith,
989	you say honestly.
990	
991	DON PEDRO	The Lady Beatrice hath a quarrel to you: the
992	gentleman that danced with her told her she is much
993	wronged by you.
994	
995	BENEDICK	O, she misused me past the endurance of a block!
996	an oak but with one green leaf on it would have
997	answered her; my very visor began to assume life and
998	scold with her. She told me, not thinking I had been
999	myself, that I was the prince's jester, that I was
1000	duller than a great thaw; huddling jest upon jest
1001	with such impossible conveyance upon me that I stood
1002	like a man at a mark, with a whole army shooting at
1003	me. She speaks poniards, and every word stabs:
1004	if her breath were as terrible as her terminations,
1005	there were no living near her; she would infect to
1006	the north star. I would not marry her, though she
1007	were endowed with all that Adam bad left him before
1008	he transgressed: she would have made Hercules have
1009	turned spit, yea, and have cleft his club to make
1010	the fire too. Come, talk not of her: you shall find
1011	her the infernal Ate in good apparel. I would to God
1012	some scholar would conjure her; for certainly, while
1013	she is here, a man may live as quiet in hell as in a
1014	sanctuary; and people sin upon purpose, because they
1015	would go thither; so, indeed, all disquiet, horror
1016	and perturbation follows her.
1017	
1018	DON PEDRO	Look, here she comes.
1019	
1020	[Enter CLAUDIO, BEATRICE, HERO, and LEONATO]
1021	
1022	BENEDICK	Will your grace command me any service to the
1023	world's end? I will go on the slightest errand now
1024	to the Antipodes that you can devise to send me on;
1025	I will fetch you a tooth-picker now from the
1026	furthest inch of Asia, bring you the length of
1027	Prester John's foot, fetch you a hair off the great
1028	Cham's beard, do you any embassage to the Pigmies,
1029	rather than hold three words' conference with this
1030	harpy. You have no employment for me?
1031	
1032	DON PEDRO	None, but to desire your good company.
1033	
1034	BENEDICK	O God, sir, here's a dish I love not: I cannot
1035	endure my Lady Tongue.
1036	
1037	[Exit]
1038	
1039	DON PEDRO	Come, lady, come; you have lost the heart of
1040	Signior Benedick.
1041	
1042	BEATRICE	Indeed, my lord, he lent it me awhile; and I gave
1043	him use for it, a double heart for his single one:
1044	marry, once before he won it of me with false dice,
1045	therefore your grace may well say I have lost it.
1046	
1047	DON PEDRO	You have put him down, lady, you have put him down.
1048	
1049	BEATRICE	So I would not he should do me, my lord, lest I
1050	should prove the mother of fools. I have brought
1051	Count Claudio, whom you sent me to seek.
1052	
1053	DON PEDRO	Why, how now, count! wherefore are you sad?
1054	
1055	CLAUDIO	Not sad, my lord.
1056	
1057	DON PEDRO	How then? sick?
1058	
1059	CLAUDIO	Neither, my lord.
1060	
1061	BEATRICE	The count is neither sad, nor sick, nor merry, nor
1062	well; but civil count, civil as an orange, and
1063	something of that jealous complexion.
1064	
1065	DON PEDRO	I' faith, lady, I think your blazon to be true;
1066	though, I'll be sworn, if he be so, his conceit is
1067	false. Here, Claudio, I have wooed in thy name, and
1068	fair Hero is won: I have broke with her father,
1069	and his good will obtained: name the day of
1070	marriage, and God give thee joy!
1071	
1072	LEONATO	Count, take of me my daughter, and with her my
1073	fortunes: his grace hath made the match, and an
1074	grace say Amen to it.
1075	
1076	BEATRICE	Speak, count, 'tis your cue.
1077	
1078	CLAUDIO	Silence is the perfectest herald of joy: I were
1079	but little happy, if I could say how much. Lady, as
1080	you are mine, I am yours: I give away myself for
1081	you and dote upon the exchange.
1082	
1083	BEATRICE	Speak, cousin; or, if you cannot, stop his mouth
1084	with a kiss, and let not him speak neither.
1085	
1086	DON PEDRO	In faith, lady, you have a merry heart.
1087	
1088	BEATRICE	Yea, my lord; I thank it, poor fool, it keeps on
1089	the windy side of care. My cousin tells him in his
1090	ear that he is in her heart.
1091	
1092	CLAUDIO	And so she doth, cousin.
1093	
1094	BEATRICE	Good Lord, for alliance! Thus goes every one to the
1095	world but I, and I am sunburnt; I may sit in a
1096	corner and cry heigh-ho for a husband!
1097	
1098	DON PEDRO	Lady Beatrice, I will get you one.
1099	
1100	BEATRICE	I would rather have one of your father's getting.
1101	Hath your grace ne'er a brother like you? Your
1102	father got excellent husbands, if a maid could come by them.
1103	
1104	DON PEDRO	Will you have me, lady?
1105	
1106	BEATRICE	No, my lord, unless I might have another for
1107	working-days: your grace is too costly to wear
1108	every day. But, I beseech your grace, pardon me: I
1109	was born to speak all mirth and no matter.
1110	
1111	DON PEDRO	Your silence most offends me, and to be merry best
1112	becomes you; for, out of question, you were born in
1113	a merry hour.
1114	
1115	BEATRICE	No, sure, my lord, my mother cried; but then there
1116	was a star danced, and under that was I born.
1117	Cousins, God give you joy!
1118	
1119	LEONATO	Niece, will you look to those things I told you of?
1120	
1121	BEATRICE	I cry you mercy, uncle. By your grace's pardon.
1122	
1123	[Exit]
1124	
1125	DON PEDRO	By my troth, a pleasant-spirited lady.
1126	
1127	LEONATO	There's little of the melancholy element in her, my
1128	lord: she is never sad but when she sleeps, and
1129	not ever sad then; for I have heard my daughter say,
1130	she hath often dreamed of unhappiness and waked
1131	herself with laughing.
1132	
1133	DON PEDRO	She cannot endure to hear tell of a husband.
1134	
1135	LEONATO	O, by no means: she mocks all her wooers out of suit.
1136	
1137	DON PEDRO	She were an excellent wife for Benedict.
1138	
1139	LEONATO	O Lord, my lord, if they were but a week married,
1140	they would talk themselves mad.
1141	
1142	DON PEDRO	County Claudio, when mean you to go to church?
1143	
1144	CLAUDIO	To-morrow, my lord: time goes on crutches till love
1145	have all his rites.
1146	
1147	LEONATO	Not till Monday, my dear son, which is hence a just
1148	seven-night; and a time too brief, too, to have all
1149	things answer my mind.
1150	
1151	DON PEDRO	Come, you shake the head at so long a breathing:
1152	but, I warrant thee, Claudio, the time shall not go
1153	dully by us. I will in the interim undertake one of
1154	Hercules' labours; which is, to bring Signior
1155	Benedick and the Lady Beatrice into a mountain of
1156	affection the one with the other. I would fain have
1157	it a match, and I doubt not but to fashion it, if
1158	you three will but minister such assistance as I
1159	shall give you direction.
1160	
1161	LEONATO	My lord, I am for you, though it cost me ten
1162	nights' watchings.
1163	
1164	CLAUDIO	And I, my lord.
1165	
1166	DON PEDRO	And you too, gentle Hero?
1167	
1168	HERO	I will do any modest office, my lord, to help my
1169	cousin to a good husband.
1170	
1171	DON PEDRO	And Benedick is not the unhopefullest husband that
1172	I know. Thus far can I praise him; he is of a noble
1173	strain, of approved valour and confirmed honesty. I
1174	will teach you how to humour your cousin, that she
1175	shall fall in love with Benedick; and I, with your
1176	two helps, will so practise on Benedick that, in
1177	despite of his quick wit and his queasy stomach, he
1178	shall fall in love with Beatrice. If we can do this,
1179	Cupid is no longer an archer: his glory shall be
1180	ours, for we are the only love-gods. Go in with me,
1181	and I will tell you my drift.

1196	
1197	
1198	[Enter DON JOHN and BORACHIO]
1199	
1200	DON JOHN	It is so; the Count Claudio shall marry the
1201	daughter of Leonato.
1202	
1203	BORACHIO	Yea, my lord; but I can cross it.
1204	
1205	DON JOHN	Any bar, any cross, any impediment will be
1206	medicinable to me: I am sick in displeasure to him,
1207	and whatsoever comes athwart his affection ranges
1208	evenly with mine. How canst thou cross this marriage?
1209	
1210	BORACHIO	Not honestly, my lord; but so covertly that no
1211	dishonesty shall appear in me.
1212	
1213	DON JOHN	Show me briefly how.
1214	
1215	BORACHIO	I think I told your lordship a year since, how much
1216	I am in the favour of Margaret, the waiting
1217	gentlewoman to Hero.
1218	
1219	DON JOHN	I remember.
1220	
1221	BORACHIO	I can, at any unseasonable instant of the night,
1222	appoint her to look out at her lady's chamber window.
1223	
1224	DON JOHN	What life is in that, to be the death of this marriage?
1225	
1226	BORACHIO	The poison of that lies in you to temper. Go you to
1227	the prince your brother; spare not to tell him that
1228	he hath wronged his honour in marrying the renowned
1229	Claudio--whose estimation do you mightily hold
1230	up--to a contaminated stale, such a one as Hero.
1231	
1232	DON JOHN	What proof shall I make of that?
1233	
1234	BORACHIO	Proof enough to misuse the prince, to vex Claudio,
1235	to undo Hero and kill Leonato. Look you for any
1236	other issue?
1237	
1238	DON JOHN	Only to despite them, I will endeavour any thing.
1239	
1240	BORACHIO	Go, then; find me a meet hour to draw Don Pedro and
1241	the Count Claudio alone: tell them that you know
1242	that Hero loves me; intend a kind of zeal both to the
1243	prince and Claudio, as,--in love of your brother's
1244	honour, who hath made this match, and his friend's
1245	reputation, who is thus like to be cozened with the
1246	semblance of a maid,--that you have discovered
1247	thus. They will scarcely believe this without trial:
1248	offer them instances; which shall bear no less
1249	likelihood than to see me at her chamber-window,
1250	hear me call Margaret Hero, hear Margaret term me
1251	Claudio; and bring them to see this the very night
1252	before the intended wedding,--for in the meantime I
1253	will so fashion the matter that Hero shall be
1254	absent,--and there shall appear such seeming truth
1255	of Hero's disloyalty that jealousy shall be called
1256	assurance and all the preparation overthrown.
1257	
1258	DON JOHN	Grow this to what adverse issue it can, I will put
1259	it in practise. Be cunning in the working this, and
1260	thy fee is a thousand ducats.
1261	
1262	BORACHIO	Be you constant in the accusation, and my cunning
1263	shall not shame me.
1264	
1265	DON JOHN	I will presently go learn their day of marriage.

1275	ACT II
1276	
1277	
1278	
1279	SCENE III	LEONATO'S orchard.
1280	
1281	
1282	[Enter BENEDICK]
1283	
1284	BENEDICK	Boy!
1285	
1286	[Enter Boy]
1287	
1288	Boy	Signior?
1289	
1290	BENEDICK	In my chamber-window lies a book: bring it hither
1291	to me in the orchard.
1292	
1293	Boy	I am here already, sir.
1294	
1295	BENEDICK	I know that; but I would have thee hence, and here again.
1296	
1297	[Exit Boy]
1298	
1299	I do much wonder that one man, seeing how much
1300	another man is a fool when he dedicates his
1301	behaviors to love, will, after he hath laughed at
1302	such shallow follies in others, become the argument
1303	of his own scorn by failing in love: and such a man
1304	is Claudio. I have known when there was no music
1305	with him but the drum and the fife; and now had he
1306	rather hear the tabour and the pipe: I have known
1307	when he would have walked ten mile a-foot to see a
1308	good armour; and now will he lie ten nights awake,
1309	carving the fashion of a new doublet. He was wont to
1310	speak plain and to the purpose, like an honest man
1311	and a soldier; and now is he turned orthography; his
1312	words are a very fantastical banquet, just so many
1313	strange dishes. May I be so converted and see with
1314	these eyes? I cannot tell; I think not: I will not
1315	be sworn, but love may transform me to an oyster; but
1316	I'll take my oath on it, till he have made an oyster
1317	of me, he shall never make me such a fool. One woman
1318	is fair, yet I am well; another is wise, yet I am
1319	well; another virtuous, yet I am well; but till all
1320	graces be in one woman, one woman shall not come in
1321	my grace. Rich she shall be, that's certain; wise,
1322	or I'll none; virtuous, or I'll never cheapen her;
1323	fair, or I'll   never look on her; mild, or come not
1324	near me; noble, or not I for an angel; of good
1325	discourse, an excellent musician, and her hair shall
1326	be of what colour it please God. Ha! the prince and
1327	Monsieur Love! I will hide me in the arbour.
1328	
1329	[Withdraws]
1330	
1331	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO]
1332	
1333	DON PEDRO	Come, shall we hear this music?
1334	
1335	CLAUDIO	Yea, my good lord. How still the evening is,
1336	As hush'd on purpose to grace harmony!
1337	
1338	DON PEDRO	See you where Benedick hath hid himself?
1339	
1340	CLAUDIO	O, very well, my lord: the music ended,
1341	We'll fit the kid-fox with a pennyworth.
1342	
1343	[Enter BALTHASAR with Music]
1344	
1345	DON PEDRO	Come, Balthasar, we'll hear that song again.
1346	
1347	BALTHASAR	O, good my lord, tax not so bad a voice
1348	To slander music any more than once.
1349	
1350	DON PEDRO	It is the witness still of excellency
1351	To put a strange face on his own perfection.
1352	I pray thee, sing, and let me woo no more.
1353	
1354	BALTHASAR	Because you talk of wooing, I will sing;
1355	Since many a wooer doth commence his suit
1356	To her he thinks not worthy, yet he wooes,
1357	Yet will he swear he loves.
1358	
1359	DON PEDRO	Now, pray thee, come;
1360	Or, if thou wilt hold longer argument,
1361	Do it in notes.
1362	
1363	BALTHASAR	                  Note this before my notes;
1364	There's not a note of mine that's worth the noting.
1365	
1366	DON PEDRO	Why, these are very crotchets that he speaks;
1367	Note, notes, forsooth, and nothing.
1368	[Air]
1369	
1370	BENEDICK	Now, divine air! now is his soul ravished! Is it
1371	not strange that sheeps' guts should hale souls out
1372	of men's bodies? Well, a horn for my money, when
1373	all's done.
1374	
1375	[The Song]
1376	
1377	BALTHASAR	     Sigh no more, ladies, sigh no more,
1378	Men were deceivers ever,
1379	One foot in sea and one on shore,
1380	To one thing constant never:
1381	Then sigh not so, but let them go,
1382	And be you blithe and bonny,
1383	Converting all your sounds of woe
1384	Into Hey nonny, nonny.
1385	
1386	Sing no more ditties, sing no moe,
1387	Of dumps so dull and heavy;
1388	The fraud of men was ever so,
1389	Since summer first was leafy:
1390	Then sigh not so, &c.
1391	
1392	DON PEDRO	By my troth, a good song.
1393	
1394	BALTHASAR	And an ill singer, my lord.
1395	
1396	DON PEDRO	Ha, no, no, faith; thou singest well enough for a shift.
1397	
1398	BENEDICK	An he had been a dog that should have howled thus,
1399	they would have hanged him: and I pray God his bad
1400	voice bode no mischief. I had as lief have heard the
1401	night-raven, come what plague could have come after
1402	it.
1403	
1404	DON PEDRO	Yea, marry, dost thou hear, Balthasar? I pray thee,
1405	get us some excellent music; for to-morrow night we
1406	would have it at the Lady Hero's chamber-window.
1407	
1408	BALTHASAR	The best I can, my lord.
1409	
1410	DON PEDRO	Do so: farewell.
1411	
1412	[Exit BALTHASAR]
1413	
1414	Come hither, Leonato. What was it you told me of
1415	to-day, that your niece Beatrice was in love with
1416	Signior Benedick?
1417	
1418	CLAUDIO	O, ay: stalk on. stalk on; the fowl sits. I did
1419	never think that lady would have loved any man.
1420	
1421	LEONATO	No, nor I neither; but most wonderful that she
1422	should so dote on Signior Benedick, whom she hath in
1423	all outward behaviors seemed ever to abhor.
1424	
1425	BENEDICK	Is't possible? Sits the wind in that corner?
1426	
1427	LEONATO	By my troth, my lord, I cannot tell what to think
1428	of it but that she loves him with an enraged
1429	affection: it is past the infinite of thought.
1430	
1431	DON PEDRO	May be she doth but counterfeit.
1432	
1433	CLAUDIO	Faith, like enough.
1434	
1435	LEONATO	O God, counterfeit! There was never counterfeit of
1436	passion came so near the life of passion as she
1437	discovers it.
1438	
1439	DON PEDRO	Why, what effects of passion shows she?
1440	
1441	CLAUDIO	Bait the hook well; this fish will bite.
1442	
1443	LEONATO	What effects, my lord? She will sit you, you heard
1444	my daughter tell you how.
1445	
1446	CLAUDIO	She did, indeed.
1447	
1448	DON PEDRO	How, how, pray you? You amaze me: I would have I
1449	thought her spirit had been invincible against all
1450	assaults of affection.
1451	
1452	LEONATO	I would have sworn it had, my lord; especially
1453	against Benedick.
1454	
1455	BENEDICK	I should think this a gull, but that the
1456	white-bearded fellow speaks it: knavery cannot,
1457	sure, hide himself in such reverence.
1458	
1459	CLAUDIO	He hath ta'en the infection: hold it up.
1460	
1461	DON PEDRO	Hath she made her affection known to Benedick?
1462	
1463	LEONATO	No; and swears she never will: that's her torment.
1464	
1465	CLAUDIO	'Tis true, indeed; so your daughter says: 'Shall
1466	I,' says she, 'that have so oft encountered him
1467	with scorn, write to him that I love him?'
1468	
1469	LEONATO	This says she now when she is beginning to write to
1470	him; for she'll be up twenty times a night, and
1471	there will she sit in her smock till she have writ a
1472	sheet of paper: my daughter tells us all.
1473	
1474	CLAUDIO	Now you talk of a sheet of paper, I remember a
1475	pretty jest your daughter told us of.
1476	
1477	LEONATO	O, when she had writ it and was reading it over, she
1478	found Benedick and Beatrice between the sheet?
1479	
1480	CLAUDIO	That.
1481	
1482	LEONATO	O, she tore the letter into a thousand halfpence;
1483	railed at herself, that she should be so immodest
1484	to write to one that she knew would flout her; 'I
1485	measure him,' says she, 'by my own spirit; for I
1486	should flout him, if he writ to me; yea, though I
1487	love him, I should.'
1488	
1489	CLAUDIO	Then down upon her knees she falls, weeps, sobs,
1490	beats her heart, tears her hair, prays, curses; 'O
1491	sweet Benedick! God give me patience!'
1492	
1493	LEONATO	She doth indeed; my daughter says so: and the
1494	ecstasy hath so much overborne her that my daughter
1495	is sometime afeared she will do a desperate outrage
1496	to herself: it is very true.
1497	
1498	DON PEDRO	It were good that Benedick knew of it by some
1499	other, if she will not discover it.
1500	
1501	CLAUDIO	To what end? He would make but a sport of it and
1502	torment the poor lady worse.
1503	
1504	DON PEDRO	An he should, it were an alms to hang him. She's an
1505	excellent sweet lady; and, out of all suspicion,
1506	she is virtuous.
1507	
1508	CLAUDIO	And she is exceeding wise.
1509	
1510	DON PEDRO	In every thing but in loving Benedick.
1511	
1512	LEONATO	O, my lord, wisdom and blood combating in so tender
1513	a body, we have ten proofs to one that blood hath
1514	the victory. I am sorry for her, as I have just
1515	cause, being her uncle and her guardian.
1516	
1517	DON PEDRO	I would she had bestowed this dotage on me: I would
1518	have daffed all other respects and made her half
1519	myself. I pray you, tell Benedick of it, and hear
1520	what a' will say.
1521	
1522	LEONATO	Were it good, think you?
1523	
1524	CLAUDIO	Hero thinks surely she will die; for she says she
1525	will die, if he love her not, and she will die, ere
1526	she make her love known, and she will die, if he woo
1527	her, rather than she will bate one breath of her
1528	accustomed crossness.
1529	
1530	DON PEDRO	She doth well: if she should make tender of her
1531	love, 'tis very possible he'll scorn it; for the
1532	man, as you know all, hath a contemptible spirit.
1533	
1534	CLAUDIO	He is a very proper man.
1535	
1536	DON PEDRO	He hath indeed a good outward happiness.
1537	
1538	CLAUDIO	Before God! and, in my mind, very wise.
1539	
1540	DON PEDRO	He doth indeed show some sparks that are like wit.
1541	
1542	CLAUDIO	And I take him to be valiant.
1543	
1544	DON PEDRO	As Hector, I assure you: and in the managing of
1545	quarrels you may say he is wise; for either he
1546	avoids them with great discretion, or undertakes
1547	them with a most Christian-like fear.
1548	
1549	LEONATO	If he do fear God, a' must necessarily keep peace:
1550	if he break the peace, he ought to enter into a
1551	quarrel with fear and trembling.
1552	
1553	DON PEDRO	And so will he do; for the man doth fear God,
1554	howsoever it seems not in him by some large jests
1555	he will make. Well I am sorry for your niece. Shall
1556	we go seek Benedick, and tell him of her love?
1557	
1558	CLAUDIO	Never tell him, my lord: let her wear it out with
1559	good counsel.
1560	
1561	LEONATO	Nay, that's impossible: she may wear her heart out first.
1562	
1563	DON PEDRO	Well, we will hear further of it by your daughter:
1564	let it cool the while. I love Benedick well; and I
1565	could wish he would modestly examine himself, to see
1566	how much he is unworthy so good a lady.
1567	
1568	LEONATO	My lord, will you walk? dinner is ready.
1569	
1570	CLAUDIO	If he do not dote on her upon this, I will never
1571	trust my expectation.
1572	
1573	DON PEDRO	Let there be the same net spread for her; and that
1574	must your daughter and her gentlewomen carry. The
1575	sport will be, when they hold one an opinion of
1576	another's dotage, and no such matter: that's the
1577	scene that I would see, which will be merely a
1578	dumb-show. Let us send her to call him in to dinner.
1579	
1580	[Exeunt DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and LEONATO]
1581	
1582	BENEDICK	[Coming forward]  This can be no trick: the
1583	conference was sadly borne. They have the truth of
1584	this from Hero. They seem to pity the lady: it
1585	seems her affections have their full bent. Love me!
1586	why, it must be requited. I hear how I am censured:
1587	they say I will bear myself proudly, if I perceive
1588	the love come from her; they say too that she will
1589	rather die than give any sign of affection. I did
1590	never think to marry: I must not seem proud: happy
1591	are they that hear their detractions and can put
1592	them to mending. They say the lady is fair; 'tis a
1593	truth, I can bear them witness; and virtuous; 'tis
1594	so, I cannot reprove it; and wise, but for loving
1595	me; by my troth, it is no addition to her wit, nor
1596	no great argument of her folly, for I will be
1597	horribly in love with her. I may chance have some
1598	odd quirks and remnants of wit broken on me,
1599	because I have railed so long against marriage: but
1600	doth not the appetite alter? a man loves the meat
1601	in his youth that he cannot endure in his age.
1602	Shall quips and sentences and these paper bullets of
1603	the brain awe a man from the career of his humour?
1604	No, the world must be peopled. When I said I would
1605	die a bachelor, I did not think I should live till I
1606	were married. Here comes Beatrice. By this day!
1607	she's a fair lady: I do spy some marks of love in
1608	her.
1609	
1610	[Enter BEATRICE]
1611	
1612	BEATRICE	Against my will I am sent to bid you come in to dinner.
1613	
1614	BENEDICK	Fair Beatrice, I thank you for your pains.
1615	
1616	BEATRICE	I took no more pains for those thanks than you take
1617	pains to thank me: if it had been painful, I would
1618	not have come.
1619	
1620	BENEDICK	You take pleasure then in the message?
1621	
1622	BEATRICE	Yea, just so much as you may take upon a knife's
1623	point and choke a daw withal. You have no stomach,
1624	signior: fare you well.
1625	
1626	[Exit]
1627	
1628	BENEDICK	Ha! 'Against my will I am sent to bid you come in
1629	to dinner;' there's a double meaning in that 'I took
1630	no more pains for those thanks than you took pains
1631	to thank me.' that's as much as to say, Any pains
1632	that I take for you is as easy as thanks. If I do
1633	not take pity of her, I am a villain; if I do not
1634	love her, I am a Jew. I will go get her picture.

1647	
1648	SCENE I	LEONATO'S garden.
1649	
1650	
1651	[Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA]
1652	
1653	HERO	Good Margaret, run thee to the parlor;
1654	There shalt thou find my cousin Beatrice
1655	Proposing with the prince and Claudio:
1656	Whisper her ear and tell her, I and Ursula
1657	Walk in the orchard and our whole discourse
1658	Is all of her; say that thou overheard'st us;
1659	And bid her steal into the pleached bower,
1660	Where honeysuckles, ripen'd by the sun,
1661	Forbid the sun to enter, like favourites,
1662	Made proud by princes, that advance their pride
1663	Against that power that bred it: there will she hide her,
1664	To listen our purpose.  This is thy office;
1665	Bear thee well in it and leave us alone.
1666	
1667	MARGARET	I'll make her come, I warrant you, presently.
1668	
1669	[Exit]
1670	
1671	HERO	Now, Ursula, when Beatrice doth come,
1672	As we do trace this alley up and down,
1673	Our talk must only be of Benedick.
1674	When I do name him, let it be thy part
1675	To praise him more than ever man did merit:
1676	My talk to thee must be how Benedick
1677	Is sick in love with Beatrice. Of this matter
1678	Is little Cupid's crafty arrow made,
1679	That only wounds by hearsay.
1680	
1681	[Enter BEATRICE, behind]
1682	
1683	Now begin;
1684	For look where Beatrice, like a lapwing, runs
1685	Close by the ground, to hear our conference.
1686	
1687	URSULA	The pleasant'st angling is to see the fish
1688	Cut with her golden oars the silver stream,
1689	And greedily devour the treacherous bait:
1690	So angle we for Beatrice; who even now
1691	Is couched in the woodbine coverture.
1692	Fear you not my part of the dialogue.
1693	
1694	HERO	Then go we near her, that her ear lose nothing
1695	Of the false sweet bait that we lay for it.
1696	
1697	[Approaching the bower]
1698	
1699	No, truly, Ursula, she is too disdainful;
1700	I know her spirits are as coy and wild
1701	As haggerds of the rock.
1702	
1703	URSULA	But are you sure
1704	That Benedick loves Beatrice so entirely?
1705	
1706	HERO	So says the prince and my new-trothed lord.
1707	
1708	URSULA	And did they bid you tell her of it, madam?
1709	
1710	HERO	They did entreat me to acquaint her of it;
1711	But I persuaded them, if they loved Benedick,
1712	To wish him wrestle with affection,
1713	And never to let Beatrice know of it.
1714	
1715	URSULA	Why did you so? Doth not the gentleman
1716	Deserve as full as fortunate a bed
1717	As ever Beatrice shall couch upon?
1718	
1719	HERO	O god of love! I know he doth deserve
1720	As much as may be yielded to a man:
1721	But Nature never framed a woman's heart
1722	Of prouder stuff than that of Beatrice;
1723	Disdain and scorn ride sparkling in her eyes,
1724	Misprising what they look on, and her wit
1725	Values itself so highly that to her
1726	All matter else seems weak: she cannot love,
1727	Nor take no shape nor project of affection,
1728	She is so self-endeared.
1729	
1730	URSULA	Sure, I think so;
1731	And therefore certainly it were not good
1732	She knew his love, lest she make sport at it.
1733	
1734	HERO	Why, you speak truth. I never yet saw man,
1735	How wise, how noble, young, how rarely featured,
1736	But she would spell him backward: if fair-faced,
1737	She would swear the gentleman should be her sister;
1738	If black, why, Nature, drawing of an antique,
1739	Made a foul blot; if tall, a lance ill-headed;
1740	If low, an agate very vilely cut;
1741	If speaking, why, a vane blown with all winds;
1742	If silent, why, a block moved with none.
1743	So turns she every man the wrong side out
1744	And never gives to truth and virtue that
1745	Which simpleness and merit purchaseth.
1746	
1747	URSULA	Sure, sure, such carping is not commendable.
1748	
1749	HERO	No, not to be so odd and from all fashions
1750	As Beatrice is, cannot be commendable:
1751	But who dare tell her so? If I should speak,
1752	She would mock me into air; O, she would laugh me
1753	Out of myself, press me to death with wit.
1754	Therefore let Benedick, like cover'd fire,
1755	Consume away in sighs, waste inwardly:
1756	It were a better death than die with mocks,
1757	Which is as bad as die with tickling.
1758	
1759	URSULA	Yet tell her of it: hear what she will say.
1760	
1761	HERO	No; rather I will go to Benedick
1762	And counsel him to fight against his passion.
1763	And, truly, I'll devise some honest slanders
1764	To stain my cousin with: one doth not know
1765	How much an ill word may empoison liking.
1766	
1767	URSULA	O, do not do your cousin such a wrong.
1768	She cannot be so much without true judgment--
1769	Having so swift and excellent a wit
1770	As she is prized to have--as to refuse
1771	So rare a gentleman as Signior Benedick.
1772	
1773	HERO	He is the only man of Italy.
1774	Always excepted my dear Claudio.
1775	
1776	URSULA	I pray you, be not angry with me, madam,
1777	Speaking my fancy: Signior Benedick,
1778	For shape, for bearing, argument and valour,
1779	Goes foremost in report through Italy.
1780	
1781	HERO	Indeed, he hath an excellent good name.
1782	
1783	URSULA	His excellence did earn it, ere he had it.
1784	When are you married, madam?
1785	
1786	HERO	Why, every day, to-morrow. Come, go in:
1787	I'll show thee some attires, and have thy counsel
1788	Which is the best to furnish me to-morrow.
1789	
1790	URSULA	She's limed, I warrant you: we have caught her, madam.
1791	
1792	HERO	If it proves so, then loving goes by haps:
1793	Some Cupid kills with arrows, some with traps.
1794	
1795	[Exeunt HERO and URSULA]
1796	
1797	BEATRICE	[Coming forward]
1798	What fire is in mine ears? Can this be true?
1799	Stand I condemn'd for pride and scorn so much?
1800	Contempt, farewell! and maiden pride, adieu!
1801	No glory lives behind the back of such.
1802	And, Benedick, love on; I will requite thee,
1803	Taming my wild heart to thy loving hand:
1804	If thou dost love, my kindness shall incite thee
1805	To bind our loves up in a holy band;
1806	For others say thou dost deserve, and I
1807	Believe it better than reportingly.

1821	SCENE II	A room in LEONATO'S house
1822	
1823	
1824	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, and LEONATO]
1825	
1826	DON PEDRO	I do but stay till your marriage be consummate, and
1827	then go I toward Arragon.
1828	
1829	CLAUDIO	I'll bring you thither, my lord, if you'll
1830	vouchsafe me.
1831	
1832	DON PEDRO	Nay, that would be as great a soil in the new gloss
1833	of your marriage as to show a child his new coat
1834	and forbid him to wear it. I will only be bold
1835	with Benedick for his company; for, from the crown
1836	of his head to the sole of his foot, he is all
1837	mirth: he hath twice or thrice cut Cupid's
1838	bow-string and the little hangman dare not shoot at
1839	him; he hath a heart as sound as a bell and his
1840	tongue is the clapper, for what his heart thinks his
1841	tongue speaks.
1842	
1843	BENEDICK	Gallants, I am not as I have been.
1844	
1845	LEONATO	So say I	methinks you are sadder.
1846	
1847	CLAUDIO	I hope he be in love.
1848	
1849	DON PEDRO	Hang him, truant! there's no true drop of blood in
1850	him, to be truly touched with love: if he be sad,
1851	he wants money.
1852	
1853	BENEDICK	I have the toothache.
1854	
1855	DON PEDRO	Draw it.
1856	
1857	BENEDICK	Hang it!
1858	
1859	CLAUDIO	You must hang it first, and draw it afterwards.
1860	
1861	DON PEDRO	What! sigh for the toothache?
1862	
1863	LEONATO	Where is but a humour or a worm.
1864	
1865	BENEDICK	Well, every one can master a grief but he that has
1866	it.
1867	
1868	CLAUDIO	Yet say I, he is in love.
1869	
1870	DON PEDRO	There is no appearance of fancy in him, unless it be
1871	a fancy that he hath to strange disguises; as, to be
1872	a Dutchman today, a Frenchman to-morrow, or in the
1873	shape of two countries at once, as, a German from
1874	the waist downward, all slops, and a Spaniard from
1875	the hip upward, no doublet. Unless he have a fancy
1876	to this foolery, as it appears he hath, he is no
1877	fool for fancy, as you would have it appear he is.
1878	
1879	CLAUDIO	If he be not in love with some woman, there is no
1880	believing old signs: a' brushes his hat o'
1881	mornings; what should that bode?
1882	
1883	DON PEDRO	Hath any man seen him at the barber's?
1884	
1885	CLAUDIO	No, but the barber's man hath been seen with him,
1886	and the old ornament of his cheek hath already
1887	stuffed tennis-balls.
1888	
1889	LEONATO	Indeed, he looks younger than he did, by the loss of a beard.
1890	
1891	DON PEDRO	Nay, a' rubs himself with civet: can you smell him
1892	out by that?
1893	
1894	CLAUDIO	That's as much as to say, the sweet youth's in love.
1895	
1896	DON PEDRO	The greatest note of it is his melancholy.
1897	
1898	CLAUDIO	And when was he wont to wash his face?
1899	
1900	DON PEDRO	Yea, or to paint himself? for the which, I hear
1901	what they say of him.
1902	
1903	CLAUDIO	Nay, but his jesting spirit; which is now crept into
1904	a lute-string and now governed by stops.
1905	
1906	DON PEDRO	Indeed, that tells a heavy tale for him: conclude,
1907	conclude he is in love.
1908	
1909	CLAUDIO	Nay, but I know who loves him.
1910	
1911	DON PEDRO	That would I know too: I warrant, one that knows him not.
1912	
1913	CLAUDIO	Yes, and his ill conditions; and, in despite of
1914	all, dies for him.
1915	
1916	DON PEDRO	She shall be buried with her face upwards.
1917	
1918	BENEDICK	Yet is this no charm for the toothache. Old
1919	signior, walk aside with me: I have studied eight
1920	or nine wise words to speak to you, which these
1921	hobby-horses must not hear.
1922	
1923	[Exeunt BENEDICK and LEONATO]
1924	
1925	DON PEDRO	For my life, to break with him about Beatrice.
1926	
1927	CLAUDIO	'Tis even so. Hero and Margaret have by this
1928	played their parts with Beatrice; and then the two
1929	bears will not bite one another when they meet.
1930	
1931	[Enter DON JOHN]
1932	
1933	DON JOHN	My lord and brother, God save you!
1934	
1935	DON PEDRO	Good den, brother.
1936	
1937	DON JOHN	If your leisure served, I would speak with you.
1938	
1939	DON PEDRO	In private?
1940	
1941	DON JOHN	If it please you: yet Count Claudio may hear; for
1942	what I would speak of concerns him.
1943	
1944	DON PEDRO	What's the matter?
1945	
1946	DON JOHN	[To CLAUDIO]  Means your lordship to be married
1947	to-morrow?
1948	
1949	DON PEDRO	You know he does.
1950	
1951	DON JOHN	I know not that, when he knows what I know.
1952	
1953	CLAUDIO	If there be any impediment, I pray you discover it.
1954	
1955	DON JOHN	You may think I love you not: let that appear
1956	hereafter, and aim better at me by that I now will
1957	manifest. For my brother, I think he holds you
1958	well, and in dearness of heart hath holp to effect
1959	your ensuing marriage;--surely suit ill spent and
1960	labour ill bestowed.
1961	
1962	DON PEDRO	Why, what's the matter?
1963	
1964	DON JOHN	I came hither to tell you; and, circumstances
1965	shortened, for she has been too long a talking of,
1966	the lady is disloyal.
1967	
1968	CLAUDIO	Who, Hero?
1969	
1970	DON PEDRO	Even she; Leonato's Hero, your Hero, every man's Hero:
1971	
1972	CLAUDIO	Disloyal?
1973	
1974	DON JOHN	The word is too good to paint out her wickedness; I
1975	could say she were worse: think you of a worse
1976	title, and I will fit her to it. Wonder not till
1977	further warrant: go but with me to-night, you shall
1978	see her chamber-window entered, even the night
1979	before her wedding-day: if you love her then,
1980	to-morrow wed her; but it would better fit your honour
1981	to change your mind.
1982	
1983	CLAUDIO	May this be so?
1984	
1985	DON PEDRO	I will not think it.
1986	
1987	DON JOHN	If you dare not trust that you see, confess not
1988	that you know: if you will follow me, I will show
1989	you enough; and when you have seen more and heard
1990	more, proceed accordingly.
1991	
1992	CLAUDIO	If I see any thing to-night why I should not marry
1993	her to-morrow in the congregation, where I should
1994	wed, there will I shame her.
1995	
1996	DON PEDRO	And, as I wooed for thee to obtain her, I will join
1997	with thee to disgrace her.
1998	
1999	DON JOHN	I will disparage her no farther till you are my
2000	witnesses: bear it coldly but till midnight, and
2001	let the issue show itself.
2002	
2003	DON PEDRO	O day untowardly turned!
2004	
2005	CLAUDIO	O mischief strangely thwarting!
2006	
2007	DON JOHN	O plague right well prevented! so will you say when
2008	you have seen the sequel.

2023	
2024	
2025	[Enter DOGBERRY and VERGES with the Watch]
2026	
2027	DOGBERRY	Are you good men and true?
2028	
2029	VERGES	Yea, or else it were pity but they should suffer
2030	salvation, body and soul.
2031	
2032	DOGBERRY	Nay, that were a punishment too good for them, if
2033	they should have any allegiance in them, being
2034	chosen for the prince's watch.
2035	
2036	VERGES	Well, give them their charge, neighbour Dogberry.
2037	
2038	DOGBERRY	First, who think you the most desertless man to be
2039	constable?
2040	
2041	First Watchman	Hugh Otecake, sir, or George Seacole; for they can
2042	write and read.
2043	
2044	DOGBERRY	Come hither, neighbour Seacole. God hath blessed
2045	you with a good name: to be a well-favoured man is
2046	the gift of fortune; but to write and read comes by nature.
2047	
2048	Second Watchman	Both which, master constable,--
2049	
2050	DOGBERRY	You have: I knew it would be your answer. Well,
2051	for your favour, sir, why, give God thanks, and make
2052	no boast of it; and for your writing and reading,
2053	let that appear when there is no need of such
2054	vanity. You are thought here to be the most
2055	senseless and fit man for the constable of the
2056	watch; therefore bear you the lantern. This is your
2057	charge: you shall comprehend all vagrom men; you are
2058	to bid any man stand, in the prince's name.
2059	
2060	Second Watchman	How if a' will not stand?
2061	
2062	DOGBERRY	Why, then, take no note of him, but let him go; and
2063	presently call the rest of the watch together and
2064	thank God you are rid of a knave.
2065	
2066	VERGES	If he will not stand when he is bidden, he is none
2067	of the prince's subjects.
2068	
2069	DOGBERRY	True, and they are to meddle with none but the
2070	prince's subjects. You shall also make no noise in
2071	the streets; for, for the watch to babble and to
2072	talk is most tolerable and not to be endured.
2073	
2074	Watchman	We will rather sleep than talk: we know what
2075	belongs to a watch.
2076	
2077	DOGBERRY	Why, you speak like an ancient and most quiet
2078	watchman; for I cannot see how sleeping should
2079	offend: only, have a care that your bills be not
2080	stolen. Well, you are to call at all the
2081	ale-houses, and bid those that are drunk get them to bed.
2082	
2083	Watchman	How if they will not?
2084	
2085	DOGBERRY	Why, then, let them alone till they are sober: if
2086	they make you not then the better answer, you may
2087	say they are not the men you took them for.
2088	
2089	Watchman	Well, sir.
2090	
2091	DOGBERRY	If you meet a thief, you may suspect him, by virtue
2092	of your office, to be no true man; and, for such
2093	kind of men, the less you meddle or make with them,
2094	why the more is for your honesty.
2095	
2096	Watchman	If we know him to be a thief, shall we not lay
2097	hands on him?
2098	
2099	DOGBERRY	Truly, by your office, you may; but I think they
2100	that touch pitch will be defiled: the most peaceable
2101	way for you, if you do take a thief, is to let him
2102	show himself what he is and steal out of your company.
2103	
2104	VERGES	You have been always called a merciful man, partner.
2105	
2106	DOGBERRY	Truly, I would not hang a dog by my will, much more
2107	a man who hath any honesty in him.
2108	
2109	VERGES	If you hear a child cry in the night, you must call
2110	to the nurse and bid her still it.
2111	
2112	Watchman	How if the nurse be asleep and will not hear us?
2113	
2114	DOGBERRY	Why, then, depart in peace, and let the child wake
2115	her with crying; for the ewe that will not hear her
2116	lamb when it baes will never answer a calf when he bleats.
2117	
2118	VERGES	'Tis very true.
2119	
2120	DOGBERRY	This is the end of the charge:--you, constable, are
2121	to present the prince's own person: if you meet the
2122	prince in the night, you may stay him.
2123	
2124	VERGES	Nay, by'r our lady, that I think a' cannot.
2125	
2126	DOGBERRY	Five shillings to one on't, with any man that knows
2127	the statutes, he may stay him: marry, not without
2128	the prince be willing; for, indeed, the watch ought
2129	to offend no man; and it is an offence to stay a
2130	man against his will.
2131	
2132	VERGES	By'r lady, I think it be so.
2133	
2134	DOGBERRY	Ha, ha, ha! Well, masters, good night: an there be
2135	any matter of weight chances, call up me: keep your
2136	fellows' counsels and your own; and good night.
2137	Come, neighbour.
2138	
2139	Watchman	Well, masters, we hear our charge: let us go sit here
2140	upon the church-bench till two, and then all to bed.
2141	
2142	DOGBERRY	One word more, honest neighbours. I pray you watch
2143	about Signior Leonato's door; for the wedding being
2144	there to-morrow, there is a great coil to-night.
2145	Adieu: be vigitant, I beseech you.
2146	
2147	[Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES]
2148	
2149	[Enter BORACHIO and CONRADE]
2150	
2151	BORACHIO	What Conrade!
2152	
2153	Watchman	[Aside]  Peace! stir not.
2154	
2155	BORACHIO	Conrade, I say!
2156	
2157	CONRADE	Here, man; I am at thy elbow.
2158	
2159	BORACHIO	Mass, and my elbow itched; I thought there would a
2160	scab follow.
2161	
2162	CONRADE	I will owe thee an answer for that: and now forward
2163	with thy tale.
2164	
2165	BORACHIO	Stand thee close, then, under this pent-house, for
2166	it drizzles rain; and I will, like a true drunkard,
2167	utter all to thee.
2168	
2169	Watchman	[Aside]  Some treason, masters: yet stand close.
2170	
2171	BORACHIO	Therefore know I have earned of Don John a thousand ducats.
2172	
2173	CONRADE	Is it possible that any villany should be so dear?
2174	
2175	BORACHIO	Thou shouldst rather ask if it were possible any
2176	villany should be so rich; for when rich villains
2177	have need of poor ones, poor ones may make what
2178	price they will.
2179	
2180	CONRADE	I wonder at it.
2181	
2182	BORACHIO	That shows thou art unconfirmed. Thou knowest that
2183	the fashion of a doublet, or a hat, or a cloak, is
2184	nothing to a man.
2185	
2186	CONRADE	Yes, it is apparel.
2187	
2188	BORACHIO	I mean, the fashion.
2189	
2190	CONRADE	Yes, the fashion is the fashion.
2191	
2192	BORACHIO	Tush! I may as well say the fool's the fool. But
2193	seest thou not what a deformed thief this fashion
2194	is?
2195	
2196	Watchman	[Aside]  I know that Deformed; a' has been a vile
2197	thief this seven year; a' goes up and down like a
2198	gentleman: I remember his name.
2199	
2200	BORACHIO	Didst thou not hear somebody?
2201	
2202	CONRADE	No; 'twas the vane on the house.
2203	
2204	BORACHIO	Seest thou not, I say, what a deformed thief this
2205	fashion is? how giddily a' turns about all the hot
2206	bloods between fourteen and five-and-thirty?
2207	sometimes fashioning them like Pharaoh's soldiers
2208	in the reeky painting, sometime like god Bel's
2209	priests in the old church-window, sometime like the
2210	shaven Hercules in the smirched worm-eaten tapestry,
2211	where his codpiece seems as massy as his club?
2212	
2213	CONRADE	All this I see; and I see that the fashion wears
2214	out more apparel than the man. But art not thou
2215	thyself giddy with the fashion too, that thou hast
2216	shifted out of thy tale into telling me of the fashion?
2217	
2218	BORACHIO	Not so, neither: but know that I have to-night
2219	wooed Margaret, the Lady Hero's gentlewoman, by the
2220	name of Hero: she leans me out at her mistress'
2221	chamber-window, bids me a thousand times good
2222	night,--I tell this tale vilely:--I should first
2223	tell thee how the prince, Claudio and my master,
2224	planted and placed and possessed by my master Don
2225	John, saw afar off in the orchard this amiable encounter.
2226	
2227	CONRADE	And thought they Margaret was Hero?
2228	
2229	BORACHIO	Two of them did, the prince and Claudio; but the
2230	devil my master knew she was Margaret; and partly
2231	by his oaths, which first possessed them, partly by
2232	the dark night, which did deceive them, but chiefly
2233	by my villany, which did confirm any slander that
2234	Don John had made, away went Claudio enraged; swore
2235	he would meet her, as he was appointed, next morning
2236	at the temple, and there, before the whole
2237	congregation, shame her with what he saw o'er night
2238	and send her home again without a husband.
2239	
2240	First Watchman	We charge you, in the prince's name, stand!
2241	
2242	Second Watchman	Call up the right master constable. We have here
2243	recovered the most dangerous piece of lechery that
2244	ever was known in the commonwealth.
2245	
2246	First Watchman	And one Deformed is one of them: I know him; a'
2247	wears a lock.
2248	
2249	CONRADE	Masters, masters,--
2250	
2251	Second Watchman	You'll be made bring Deformed forth, I warrant you.
2252	
2253	CONRADE	Masters,--
2254	
2255	First Watchman	Never speak: we charge you let us obey you to go with us.
2256	
2257	BORACHIO	We are like to prove a goodly commodity, being taken
2258	up of these men's bills.
2259	
2260	CONRADE	A commodity in question, I warrant you. Come, we'll obey you.

2274	SCENE IV	HERO's apartment.
2275	
2276	
2277	[Enter HERO, MARGARET, and URSULA]
2278	
2279	HERO	Good Ursula, wake my cousin Beatrice, and desire
2280	her to rise.
2281	
2282	URSULA	I will, lady.
2283	
2284	HERO	And bid her come hither.
2285	
2286	URSULA	Well.
2287	
2288	[Exit]
2289	
2290	MARGARET	Troth, I think your other rabato were better.
2291	
2292	HERO	No, pray thee, good Meg, I'll wear this.
2293	
2294	MARGARET	By my troth, 's not so good; and I warrant your
2295	cousin will say so.
2296	
2297	HERO	My cousin's a fool, and thou art another: I'll wear
2298	none but this.
2299	
2300	MARGARET	I like the new tire within excellently, if the hair
2301	were a thought browner; and your gown's a most rare
2302	fashion, i' faith. I saw the Duchess of Milan's
2303	gown that they praise so.
2304	
2305	HERO	O, that exceeds, they say.
2306	
2307	MARGARET	By my troth, 's but a night-gown in respect of
2308	yours: cloth o' gold, and cuts, and laced with
2309	silver, set with pearls, down sleeves, side sleeves,
2310	and skirts, round underborne with a bluish tinsel:
2311	but for a fine, quaint, graceful and excellent
2312	fashion, yours is worth ten on 't.
2313	
2314	HERO	God give me joy to wear it! for my heart is
2315	exceeding heavy.
2316	
2317	MARGARET	'Twill be heavier soon by the weight of a man.
2318	
2319	HERO	Fie upon thee! art not ashamed?
2320	
2321	MARGARET	Of what, lady? of speaking honourably? Is not
2322	marriage honourable in a beggar? Is not your lord
2323	honourable without marriage? I think you would have
2324	me say, 'saving your reverence, a husband:' and bad
2325	thinking do not wrest true speaking, I'll offend
2326	nobody: is there any harm in 'the heavier for a
2327	husband'? None, I think, and it be the right husband
2328	and the right wife; otherwise 'tis light, and not
2329	heavy: ask my Lady Beatrice else; here she comes.
2330	
2331	[Enter BEATRICE]
2332	
2333	HERO	Good morrow, coz.
2334	
2335	BEATRICE	Good morrow, sweet Hero.
2336	
2337	HERO	Why how now? do you speak in the sick tune?
2338	
2339	BEATRICE	I am out of all other tune, methinks.
2340	
2341	MARGARET	Clap's into 'Light o' love;' that goes without a
2342	burden: do you sing it, and I'll dance it.
2343	
2344	BEATRICE	Ye light o' love, with your heels! then, if your
2345	husband have stables enough, you'll see he shall
2346	lack no barns.
2347	
2348	MARGARET	O illegitimate construction! I scorn that with my heels.
2349	
2350	BEATRICE	'Tis almost five o'clock, cousin; tis time you were
2351	ready. By my troth, I am exceeding ill: heigh-ho!
2352	
2353	MARGARET	For a hawk, a horse, or a husband?
2354	
2355	BEATRICE	For the letter that begins them all, H.
2356	
2357	MARGARET	Well, and you be not turned Turk, there's no more
2358	sailing by the star.
2359	
2360	BEATRICE	What means the fool, trow?
2361	
2362	MARGARET	Nothing I; but God send every one their heart's desire!
2363	
2364	HERO	These gloves the count sent me; they are an
2365	excellent perfume.
2366	
2367	BEATRICE	I am stuffed, cousin; I cannot smell.
2368	
2369	MARGARET	A maid, and stuffed! there's goodly catching of cold.
2370	
2371	BEATRICE	O, God help me! God help me! how long have you
2372	professed apprehension?
2373	
2374	MARGARET	Even since you left it. Doth not my wit become me rarely?
2375	
2376	BEATRICE	It is not seen enough, you should wear it in your
2377	cap. By my troth, I am sick.
2378	
2379	MARGARET	Get you some of this distilled Carduus Benedictus,
2380	and lay it to your heart: it is the only thing for a qualm.
2381	
2382	HERO	There thou prickest her with a thistle.
2383	
2384	BEATRICE	Benedictus! why Benedictus? you have some moral in
2385	this Benedictus.
2386	
2387	MARGARET	Moral! no, by my troth, I have no moral meaning; I
2388	meant, plain holy-thistle. You may think perchance
2389	that I think you are in love: nay, by'r lady, I am
2390	not such a fool to think what I list, nor I list
2391	not to think what I can, nor indeed I cannot think,
2392	if I would think my heart out of thinking, that you
2393	are in love or that you will be in love or that you
2394	can be in love. Yet Benedick was such another, and
2395	now is he become a man: he swore he would never
2396	marry, and yet now, in despite of his heart, he eats
2397	his meat without grudging: and how you may be
2398	converted I know not, but methinks you look with
2399	your eyes as other women do.
2400	
2401	BEATRICE	What pace is this that thy tongue keeps?
2402	
2403	MARGARET	Not a false gallop.
2404	
2405	[Re-enter URSULA]
2406	
2407	URSULA	Madam, withdraw: the prince, the count, Signior
2408	Benedick, Don John, and all the gallants of the
2409	town, are come to fetch you to church.
2410

2426	
2427	
2428	[Enter LEONATO, with DOGBERRY and VERGES]
2429	
2430	LEONATO	What would you with me, honest neighbour?
2431	
2432	DOGBERRY	Marry, sir, I would have some confidence with you
2433	that decerns you nearly.
2434	
2435	LEONATO	Brief, I pray you; for you see it is a busy time with me.
2436	
2437	DOGBERRY	Marry, this it is, sir.
2438	
2439	VERGES	Yes, in truth it is, sir.
2440	
2441	LEONATO	What is it, my good friends?
2442	
2443	DOGBERRY	Goodman Verges, sir, speaks a little off the
2444	matter: an old man, sir, and his wits are not so
2445	blunt as, God help, I would desire they were; but,
2446	in faith, honest as the skin between his brows.
2447	
2448	VERGES	Yes, I thank God I am as honest as any man living
2449	that is an old man and no honester than I.
2450	
2451	DOGBERRY	Comparisons are odorous: palabras, neighbour Verges.
2452	
2453	LEONATO	Neighbours, you are tedious.
2454	
2455	DOGBERRY	It pleases your worship to say so, but we are the
2456	poor duke's officers; but truly, for mine own part,
2457	if I were as tedious as a king, I could find it in
2458	my heart to bestow it all of your worship.
2459	
2460	LEONATO	All thy tediousness on me, ah?
2461	
2462	DOGBERRY	Yea, an 'twere a thousand pound more than 'tis; for
2463	I hear as good exclamation on your worship as of any
2464	man in the city; and though I be but a poor man, I
2465	am glad to hear it.
2466	
2467	VERGES	And so am I.
2468	
2469	LEONATO	I would fain know what you have to say.
2470	
2471	VERGES	Marry, sir, our watch to-night, excepting your
2472	worship's presence, ha' ta'en a couple of as arrant
2473	knaves as any in Messina.
2474	
2475	DOGBERRY	A good old man, sir; he will be talking: as they
2476	say, when the age is in, the wit is out: God help
2477	us! it is a world to see. Well said, i' faith,
2478	neighbour Verges: well, God's a good man; an two men
2479	ride of a horse, one must ride behind. An honest
2480	soul, i' faith, sir; by my troth he is, as ever
2481	broke bread; but God is to be worshipped; all men
2482	are not alike; alas, good neighbour!
2483	
2484	LEONATO	Indeed, neighbour, he comes too short of you.
2485	
2486	DOGBERRY	Gifts that God gives.
2487	
2488	LEONATO	I must leave you.
2489	
2490	DOGBERRY	One word, sir: our watch, sir, have indeed
2491	comprehended two aspicious persons, and we would
2492	have them this morning examined before your worship.
2493	
2494	LEONATO	Take their examination yourself and bring it me: I
2495	am now in great haste, as it may appear unto you.
2496	
2497	DOGBERRY	It shall be suffigance.
2498	
2499	LEONATO	Drink some wine ere you go: fare you well.
2500	
2501	[Enter a Messenger]
2502	
2503	Messenger	My lord, they stay for you to give your daughter to
2504	her husband.
2505	
2506	LEONATO	I'll wait upon them: I am ready.
2507	
2508	[Exeunt LEONATO and Messenger]
2509	
2510	DOGBERRY	Go, good partner, go, get you to Francis Seacole;
2511	bid him bring his pen and inkhorn to the gaol: we
2512	are now to examination these men.
2513	
2514	VERGES	And we must do it wisely.
2515	
2516	DOGBERRY	We will spare for no wit, I warrant you; here's
2517	that shall drive some of them to a non-come: only
2518	get the learned writer to set down our
2519	excommunication and meet me at the gaol.

2534	
2535	
2536	[Enter DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, LEONATO, FRIAR FRANCIS,
2537	CLAUDIO, BENEDICK, HERO, BEATRICE, and Attendants]
2538	
2539	LEONATO	Come, Friar Francis, be brief; only to the plain
2540	form of marriage, and you shall recount their
2541	particular duties afterwards.
2542	
2543	FRIAR FRANCIS	You come hither, my lord, to marry this lady.
2544	
2545	CLAUDIO	No.
2546	
2547	LEONATO	To be married to her: friar, you come to marry her.
2548	
2549	FRIAR FRANCIS	Lady, you come hither to be married to this count.
2550	
2551	HERO	I do.
2552	
2553	FRIAR FRANCIS	If either of you know any inward impediment why you
2554	should not be conjoined, charge you, on your souls,
2555	to utter it.
2556	
2557	CLAUDIO	Know you any, Hero?
2558	
2559	HERO	None, my lord.
2560	
2561	FRIAR FRANCIS	Know you any, count?
2562	
2563	LEONATO	I dare make his answer, none.
2564	
2565	CLAUDIO	O, what men dare do! what men may do! what men daily
2566	do, not knowing what they do!
2567	
2568	BENEDICK	How now! interjections? Why, then, some be of
2569	laughing, as, ah, ha, he!
2570	
2571	CLAUDIO	Stand thee by, friar. Father, by your leave:
2572	Will you with free and unconstrained soul
2573	Give me this maid, your daughter?
2574	
2575	LEONATO	As freely, son, as God did give her me.
2576	
2577	CLAUDIO	And what have I to give you back, whose worth
2578	May counterpoise this rich and precious gift?
2579	
2580	DON PEDRO	Nothing, unless you render her again.
2581	
2582	CLAUDIO	Sweet prince, you learn me noble thankfulness.
2583	There, Leonato, take her back again:
2584	Give not this rotten orange to your friend;
2585	She's but the sign and semblance of her honour.
2586	Behold how like a maid she blushes here!
2587	O, what authority and show of truth
2588	Can cunning sin cover itself withal!
2589	Comes not that blood as modest evidence
2590	To witness simple virtue? Would you not swear,
2591	All you that see her, that she were a maid,
2592	By these exterior shows? But she is none:
2593	She knows the heat of a luxurious bed;
2594	Her blush is guiltiness, not modesty.
2595	
2596	LEONATO	What do you mean, my lord?
2597	
2598	CLAUDIO	Not to be married,
2599	Not to knit my soul to an approved wanton.
2600	
2601	LEONATO	Dear my lord, if you, in your own proof,
2602	Have vanquish'd the resistance of her youth,
2603	And made defeat of her virginity,--
2604	
2605	CLAUDIO	I know what you would say: if I have known her,
2606	You will say she did embrace me as a husband,
2607	And so extenuate the 'forehand sin:
2608	No, Leonato,
2609	I never tempted her with word too large;
2610	But, as a brother to his sister, show'd
2611	Bashful sincerity and comely love.
2612	
2613	HERO	And seem'd I ever otherwise to you?
2614	
2615	CLAUDIO	Out on thee! Seeming! I will write against it:
2616	You seem to me as Dian in her orb,
2617	As chaste as is the bud ere it be blown;
2618	But you are more intemperate in your blood
2619	Than Venus, or those pamper'd animals
2620	That rage in savage sensuality.
2621	
2622	HERO	Is my lord well, that he doth speak so wide?
2623	
2624	LEONATO	Sweet prince, why speak not you?
2625	
2626	DON PEDRO	What should I speak?
2627	I stand dishonour'd, that have gone about
2628	To link my dear friend to a common stale.
2629	
2630	LEONATO	Are these things spoken, or do I but dream?
2631	
2632	DON JOHN	Sir, they are spoken, and these things are true.
2633	
2634	BENEDICK	This looks not like a nuptial.
2635	
2636	HERO	True! O God!
2637	
2638	CLAUDIO	Leonato, stand I here?
2639	Is this the prince? is this the prince's brother?
2640	Is this face Hero's? are our eyes our own?
2641	
2642	LEONATO	All this is so: but what of this, my lord?
2643	
2644	CLAUDIO	Let me but move one question to your daughter;
2645	And, by that fatherly and kindly power
2646	That you have in her, bid her answer truly.
2647	
2648	LEONATO	I charge thee do so, as thou art my child.
2649	
2650	HERO	O, God defend me! how am I beset!
2651	What kind of catechising call you this?
2652	
2653	CLAUDIO	To make you answer truly to your name.
2654	
2655	HERO	Is it not Hero? Who can blot that name
2656	With any just reproach?
2657	
2658	CLAUDIO	Marry, that can Hero;
2659	Hero itself can blot out Hero's virtue.
2660	What man was he talk'd with you yesternight
2661	Out at your window betwixt twelve and one?
2662	Now, if you are a maid, answer to this.
2663	
2664	HERO	I talk'd with no man at that hour, my lord.
2665	
2666	DON PEDRO	Why, then are you no maiden. Leonato,
2667	I am sorry you must hear: upon mine honour,
2668	Myself, my brother and this grieved count
2669	Did see her, hear her, at that hour last night
2670	Talk with a ruffian at her chamber-window
2671	Who hath indeed, most like a liberal villain,
2672	Confess'd the vile encounters they have had
2673	A thousand times in secret.
2674	
2675	DON JOHN	Fie, fie! they are not to be named, my lord,
2676	Not to be spoke of;
2677	There is not chastity enough in language
2678	Without offence to utter them. Thus, pretty lady,
2679	I am sorry for thy much misgovernment.
2680	
2681	CLAUDIO	O Hero, what a Hero hadst thou been,
2682	If half thy outward graces had been placed
2683	About thy thoughts and counsels of thy heart!
2684	But fare thee well, most foul, most fair! farewell,
2685	Thou pure impiety and impious purity!
2686	For thee I'll lock up all the gates of love,
2687	And on my eyelids shall conjecture hang,
2688	To turn all beauty into thoughts of harm,
2689	And never shall it more be gracious.
2690	
2691	LEONATO	Hath no man's dagger here a point for me?
2692	
2693	[HERO swoons]
2694	
2695	BEATRICE	Why, how now, cousin! wherefore sink you down?
2696	
2697	DON JOHN	Come, let us go. These things, come thus to light,
2698	Smother her spirits up.
2699	
2700	[Exeunt DON PEDRO, DON JOHN, and CLAUDIO]
2701	
2702	BENEDICK	How doth the lady?
2703	
2704	BEATRICE	                  Dead, I think. Help, uncle!
2705	Hero! why, Hero! Uncle! Signior Benedick! Friar!
2706	
2707	LEONATO	O Fate! take not away thy heavy hand.
2708	Death is the fairest cover for her shame
2709	That may be wish'd for.
2710	
2711	BEATRICE	How now, cousin Hero!
2712	
2713	FRIAR FRANCIS	Have comfort, lady.
2714	
2715	LEONATO	Dost thou look up?
2716	
2717	FRIAR FRANCIS	Yea, wherefore should she not?
2718	
2719	LEONATO	Wherefore! Why, doth not every earthly thing
2720	Cry shame upon her? Could she here deny
2721	The story that is printed in her blood?
2722	Do not live, Hero; do not ope thine eyes:
2723	For, did I think thou wouldst not quickly die,
2724	Thought I thy spirits were stronger than thy shames,
2725	Myself would, on the rearward of reproaches,
2726	Strike at thy life. Grieved I, I had but one?
2727	Chid I for that at frugal nature's frame?
2728	O, one too much by thee! Why had I one?
2729	Why ever wast thou lovely in my eyes?
2730	Why had I not with charitable hand
2731	Took up a beggar's issue at my gates,
2732	Who smirch'd thus and mired with infamy,
2733	I might have said 'No part of it is mine;
2734	This shame derives itself from unknown loins'?
2735	But mine and mine I loved and mine I praised
2736	And mine that I was proud on, mine so much
2737	That I myself was to myself not mine,
2738	Valuing of her,--why, she, O, she is fallen
2739	Into a pit of ink, that the wide sea
2740	Hath drops too few to wash her clean again
2741	And salt too little which may season give
2742	To her foul-tainted flesh!
2743	
2744	BENEDICK	Sir, sir, be patient.
2745	For my part, I am so attired in wonder,
2746	I know not what to say.
2747	
2748	BEATRICE	O, on my soul, my cousin is belied!
2749	
2750	BENEDICK	Lady, were you her bedfellow last night?
2751	
2752	BEATRICE	No, truly not; although, until last night,
2753	I have this twelvemonth been her bedfellow.
2754	
2755	LEONATO	Confirm'd, confirm'd! O, that is stronger made
2756	Which was before barr'd up with ribs of iron!
2757	Would the two princes lie, and Claudio lie,
2758	Who loved her so, that, speaking of her foulness,
2759	Wash'd it with tears? Hence from her! let her die.
2760	
2761	FRIAR FRANCIS	Hear me a little; for I have only been
2762	Silent so long and given way unto
2763	This course of fortune [           ]
2764	By noting of the lady I have mark'd
2765	A thousand blushing apparitions
2766	To start into her face, a thousand innocent shames
2767	In angel whiteness beat away those blushes;
2768	And in her eye there hath appear'd a fire,
2769	To burn the errors that these princes hold
2770	Against her maiden truth. Call me a fool;
2771	Trust not my reading nor my observations,
2772	Which with experimental seal doth warrant
2773	The tenor of my book; trust not my age,
2774	My reverence, calling, nor divinity,
2775	If this sweet lady lie not guiltless here
2776	Under some biting error.
2777	
2778	LEONATO	Friar, it cannot be.
2779	Thou seest that all the grace that she hath left
2780	Is that she will not add to her damnation
2781	A sin of perjury; she not denies it:
2782	Why seek'st thou then to cover with excuse
2783	That which appears in proper nakedness?
2784	
2785	FRIAR FRANCIS	Lady, what man is he you are accused of?
2786	
2787	HERO	They know that do accuse me; I know none:
2788	If I know more of any man alive
2789	Than that which maiden modesty doth warrant,
2790	Let all my sins lack mercy! O my father,
2791	Prove you that any man with me conversed
2792	At hours unmeet, or that I yesternight
2793	Maintain'd the change of words with any creature,
2794	Refuse me, hate me, torture me to death!
2795	
2796	FRIAR FRANCIS	There is some strange misprision in the princes.
2797	
2798	BENEDICK	Two of them have the very bent of honour;
2799	And if their wisdoms be misled in this,
2800	The practise of it lives in John the bastard,
2801	Whose spirits toil in frame of villanies.
2802	
2803	LEONATO	I know not. If they speak but truth of her,
2804	These hands shall tear her; if they wrong her honour,
2805	The proudest of them shall well hear of it.
2806	Time hath not yet so dried this blood of mine,
2807	Nor age so eat up my invention,
2808	Nor fortune made such havoc of my means,
2809	Nor my bad life reft me so much of friends,
2810	But they shall find, awaked in such a kind,
2811	Both strength of limb and policy of mind,
2812	Ability in means and choice of friends,
2813	To quit me of them throughly.
2814	
2815	FRIAR FRANCIS	Pause awhile,
2816	And let my counsel sway you in this case.
2817	Your daughter here the princes left for dead:
2818	Let her awhile be secretly kept in,
2819	And publish it that she is dead indeed;
2820	Maintain a mourning ostentation
2821	And on your family's old monument
2822	Hang mournful epitaphs and do all rites
2823	That appertain unto a burial.
2824	
2825	LEONATO	What shall become of this? what will this do?
2826	
2827	FRIAR FRANCIS	Marry, this well carried shall on her behalf
2828	Change slander to remorse; that is some good:
2829	But not for that dream I on this strange course,
2830	But on this travail look for greater birth.
2831	She dying, as it must so be maintain'd,
2832	Upon the instant that she was accused,
2833	Shall be lamented, pitied and excused
2834	Of every hearer: for it so falls out
2835	That what we have we prize not to the worth
2836	Whiles we enjoy it, but being lack'd and lost,
2837	Why, then we rack the value, then we find
2838	The virtue that possession would not show us
2839	Whiles it was ours. So will it fare with Claudio:
2840	When he shall hear she died upon his words,
2841	The idea of her life shall sweetly creep
2842	Into his study of imagination,
2843	And every lovely organ of her life
2844	Shall come apparell'd in more precious habit,
2845	More moving-delicate and full of life,
2846	Into the eye and prospect of his soul,
2847	Than when she lived indeed; then shall he mourn,
2848	If ever love had interest in his liver,
2849	And wish he had not so accused her,
2850	No, though he thought his accusation true.
2851	Let this be so, and doubt not but success
2852	Will fashion the event in better shape
2853	Than I can lay it down in likelihood.
2854	But if all aim but this be levell'd false,
2855	The supposition of the lady's death
2856	Will quench the wonder of her infamy:
2857	And if it sort not well, you may conceal her,
2858	As best befits her wounded reputation,
2859	In some reclusive and religious life,
2860	Out of all eyes, tongues, minds and injuries.
2861	
2862	BENEDICK	Signior Leonato, let the friar advise you:
2863	And though you know my inwardness and love
2864	Is very much unto the prince and Claudio,
2865	Yet, by mine honour, I will deal in this
2866	As secretly and justly as your soul
2867	Should with your body.
2868	
2869	LEONATO	Being that I flow in grief,
2870	The smallest twine may lead me.
2871	
2872	FRIAR FRANCIS	'Tis well consented: presently away;
2873	For to strange sores strangely they strain the cure.
2874	Come, lady, die to live: this wedding-day
2875	Perhaps is but prolong'd: have patience and endure.
2876	
2877	[Exeunt all but BENEDICK and BEATRICE]
2878	
2879	BENEDICK	Lady Beatrice, have you wept all this while?
2880	
2881	BEATRICE	Yea, and I will weep a while longer.
2882	
2883	BENEDICK	I will not desire that.
2884	
2885	BEATRICE	You have no reason; I do it freely.
2886	
2887	BENEDICK	Surely I do believe your fair cousin is wronged.
2888	
2889	BEATRICE	Ah, how much might the man deserve of me that would right her!
2890	
2891	BENEDICK	Is there any way to show such friendship?
2892	
2893	BEATRICE	A very even way, but no such friend.
2894	
2895	BENEDICK	May a man do it?
2896	
2897	BEATRICE	It is a man's office, but not yours.
2898	
2899	BENEDICK	I do love nothing in the world so well as you: is
2900	not that strange?
2901	
2902	BEATRICE	As strange as the thing I know not. It were as
2903	possible for me to say I loved nothing so well as
2904	you: but believe me not; and yet I lie not; I
2905	confess nothing, nor I deny nothing. I am sorry for my cousin.
2906	
2907	BENEDICK	By my sword, Beatrice, thou lovest me.
2908	
2909	BEATRICE	Do not swear, and eat it.
2910	
2911	BENEDICK	I will swear by it that you love me; and I will make
2912	him eat it that says I love not you.
2913	
2914	BEATRICE	Will you not eat your word?
2915	
2916	BENEDICK	With no sauce that can be devised to it. I protest
2917	I love thee.
2918	
2919	BEATRICE	Why, then, God forgive me!
2920	
2921	BENEDICK	What offence, sweet Beatrice?
2922	
2923	BEATRICE	You have stayed me in a happy hour: I was about to
2924	protest I loved you.
2925	
2926	BENEDICK	And do it with all thy heart.
2927	
2928	BEATRICE	I love you with so much of my heart that none is
2929	left to protest.
2930	
2931	BENEDICK	Come, bid me do any thing for thee.
2932	
2933	BEATRICE	Kill Claudio.
2934	
2935	BENEDICK	Ha! not for the wide world.
2936	
2937	BEATRICE	You kill me to deny it. Farewell.
2938	
2939	BENEDICK	Tarry, sweet Beatrice.
2940	
2941	BEATRICE	I am gone, though I am here: there is no love in
2942	you: nay, I pray you, let me go.
2943	
2944	BENEDICK	Beatrice,--
2945	
2946	BEATRICE	In faith, I will go.
2947	
2948	BENEDICK	We'll be friends first.
2949	
2950	BEATRICE	You dare easier be friends with me than fight with mine enemy.
2951	
2952	BENEDICK	Is Claudio thine enemy?
2953	
2954	BEATRICE	Is he not approved in the height a villain, that
2955	hath slandered, scorned, dishonoured my kinswoman? O
2956	that I were a man! What, bear her in hand until they
2957	come to take hands; and then, with public
2958	accusation, uncovered slander, unmitigated rancour,
2959	--O God, that I were a man! I would eat his heart
2960	in the market-place.
2961	
2962	BENEDICK	Hear me, Beatrice,--
2963	
2964	BEATRICE	Talk with a man out at a window! A proper saying!
2965	
2966	BENEDICK	Nay, but, Beatrice,--
2967	
2968	BEATRICE	Sweet Hero! She is wronged, she is slandered, she is undone.
2969	
2970	BENEDICK	Beat--
2971	
2972	BEATRICE	Princes and counties! Surely, a princely testimony,
2973	a goodly count, Count Comfect; a sweet gallant,
2974	surely! O that I were a man for his sake! or that I
2975	had any friend would be a man for my sake! But
2976	manhood is melted into courtesies, valour into
2977	compliment, and men are only turned into tongue, and
2978	trim ones too: he is now as valiant as Hercules
2979	that only tells a lie and swears it. I cannot be a
2980	man with wishing, therefore I will die a woman with grieving.
2981	
2982	BENEDICK	Tarry, good Beatrice. By this hand, I love thee.
2983	
2984	BEATRICE	Use it for my love some other way than swearing by it.
2985	
2986	BENEDICK	Think you in your soul the Count Claudio hath wronged Hero?
2987	
2988	BEATRICE	Yea, as sure as I have a thought or a soul.
2989	
2990	BENEDICK	Enough, I am engaged; I will challenge him. I will
2991	kiss your hand, and so I leave you. By this hand,
2992	Claudio shall render me a dear account. As you
2993	hear of me, so think of me. Go, comfort your
2994	cousin: I must say she is dead: and so, farewell.

3011	[Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and Sexton, in gowns; and
3012	the Watch, with CONRADE and BORACHIO]
3013	
3014	DOGBERRY	Is our whole dissembly appeared?
3015	
3016	VERGES	O, a stool and a cushion for the sexton.
3017	
3018	Sexton	Which be the malefactors?
3019	
3020	DOGBERRY	Marry, that am I and my partner.
3021	
3022	VERGES	Nay, that's certain; we have the exhibition to examine.
3023	
3024	Sexton	But which are the offenders that are to be
3025	examined? let them come before master constable.
3026	
3027	DOGBERRY	Yea, marry, let them come before me. What is your
3028	name, friend?
3029	
3030	BORACHIO	Borachio.
3031	
3032	DOGBERRY	Pray, write down, Borachio. Yours, sirrah?
3033	
3034	CONRADE	I am a gentleman, sir, and my name is Conrade.
3035	
3036	DOGBERRY	Write down, master gentleman Conrade. Masters, do
3037	you serve God?
3038	
3039	
3040	CONRADE	|
3041	|  Yea, sir, we hope.
3042	BORACHIO	|
3043	
3044	
3045	DOGBERRY	Write down, that they hope they serve God: and
3046	write God first; for God defend but God should go
3047	before such villains! Masters, it is proved already
3048	that you are little better than false knaves; and it
3049	will go near to be thought so shortly. How answer
3050	you for yourselves?
3051	
3052	CONRADE	Marry, sir, we say we are none.
3053	
3054	DOGBERRY	A marvellous witty fellow, I assure you: but I
3055	will go about with him. Come you hither, sirrah; a
3056	word in your ear: sir, I say to you, it is thought
3057	you are false knaves.
3058	
3059	BORACHIO	Sir, I say to you we are none.
3060	
3061	DOGBERRY	Well, stand aside. 'Fore God, they are both in a
3062	tale. Have you writ down, that they are none?
3063	
3064	Sexton	Master constable, you go not the way to examine:
3065	you must call forth the watch that are their accusers.
3066	
3067	DOGBERRY	Yea, marry, that's the eftest way. Let the watch
3068	come forth. Masters, I charge you, in the prince's
3069	name, accuse these men.
3070	
3071	First Watchman	This man said, sir, that Don John, the prince's
3072	brother, was a villain.
3073	
3074	DOGBERRY	Write down Prince John a villain. Why, this is flat
3075	perjury, to call a prince's brother villain.
3076	
3077	BORACHIO	Master constable,--
3078	
3079	DOGBERRY	Pray thee, fellow, peace: I do not like thy look,
3080	I promise thee.
3081	
3082	Sexton	What heard you him say else?
3083	
3084	Second Watchman	Marry, that he had received a thousand ducats of
3085	Don John for accusing the Lady Hero wrongfully.
3086	
3087	DOGBERRY	Flat burglary as ever was committed.
3088	
3089	VERGES	Yea, by mass, that it is.
3090	
3091	Sexton	What else, fellow?
3092	
3093	First Watchman	And that Count Claudio did mean, upon his words, to
3094	disgrace Hero before the whole assembly. and not marry her.
3095	
3096	DOGBERRY	O villain! thou wilt be condemned into everlasting
3097	redemption for this.
3098	
3099	Sexton	What else?
3100	
3101	Watchman	This is all.
3102	
3103	Sexton	And this is more, masters, than you can deny.
3104	Prince John is this morning secretly stolen away;
3105	Hero was in this manner accused, in this very manner
3106	refused, and upon the grief of this suddenly died.
3107	Master constable, let these men be bound, and
3108	brought to Leonato's: I will go before and show
3109	him their examination.
3110	
3111	[Exit]
3112	
3113	DOGBERRY	Come, let them be opinioned.
3114	
3115	VERGES	Let them be in the hands--
3116	
3117	CONRADE	Off, coxcomb!
3118	
3119	DOGBERRY	God's my life, where's the sexton? let him write
3120	down the prince's officer coxcomb. Come, bind them.
3121	Thou naughty varlet!
3122	
3123	CONRADE	Away! you are an ass, you are an ass.
3124	
3125	DOGBERRY	Dost thou not suspect my place? dost thou not
3126	suspect my years? O that he were here to write me
3127	down an ass! But, masters, remember that I am an
3128	ass; though it be not written down, yet forget not
3129	that I am an ass. No, thou villain, thou art full of
3130	piety, as shall be proved upon thee by good witness.
3131	I am a wise fellow, and, which is more, an officer,
3132	and, which is more, a householder, and, which is
3133	more, as pretty a piece of flesh as any is in
3134	Messina, and one that knows the law, go to; and a
3135	rich fellow enough, go to; and a fellow that hath
3136	had losses, and one that hath two gowns and every
3137	thing handsome about him. Bring him away. O that
3138	I had been writ down an ass!

3152	SCENE I	Before LEONATO'S house.
3153	
3154	
3155	[Enter LEONATO and ANTONIO]
3156	
3157	ANTONIO	If you go on thus, you will kill yourself:
3158	And 'tis not wisdom thus to second grief
3159	Against yourself.
3160	
3161	LEONATO	                  I pray thee, cease thy counsel,
3162	Which falls into mine ears as profitless
3163	As water in a sieve: give not me counsel;
3164	Nor let no comforter delight mine ear
3165	But such a one whose wrongs do suit with mine.
3166	Bring me a father that so loved his child,
3167	Whose joy of her is overwhelm'd like mine,
3168	And bid him speak of patience;
3169	Measure his woe the length and breadth of mine
3170	And let it answer every strain for strain,
3171	As thus for thus and such a grief for such,
3172	In every lineament, branch, shape, and form:
3173	If such a one will smile and stroke his beard,
3174	Bid sorrow wag, cry 'hem!' when he should groan,
3175	Patch grief with proverbs, make misfortune drunk
3176	With candle-wasters; bring him yet to me,
3177	And I of him will gather patience.
3178	But there is no such man: for, brother, men
3179	Can counsel and speak comfort to that grief
3180	Which they themselves not feel; but, tasting it,
3181	Their counsel turns to passion, which before
3182	Would give preceptial medicine to rage,
3183	Fetter strong madness in a silken thread,
3184	Charm ache with air and agony with words:
3185	No, no; 'tis all men's office to speak patience
3186	To those that wring under the load of sorrow,
3187	But no man's virtue nor sufficiency
3188	To be so moral when he shall endure
3189	The like himself. Therefore give me no counsel:
3190	My griefs cry louder than advertisement.
3191	
3192	ANTONIO	Therein do men from children nothing differ.
3193	
3194	LEONATO	I pray thee, peace. I will be flesh and blood;
3195	For there was never yet philosopher
3196	That could endure the toothache patiently,
3197	However they have writ the style of gods
3198	And made a push at chance and sufferance.
3199	
3200	ANTONIO	Yet bend not all the harm upon yourself;
3201	Make those that do offend you suffer too.
3202	
3203	LEONATO	There thou speak'st reason: nay, I will do so.
3204	My soul doth tell me Hero is belied;
3205	And that shall Claudio know; so shall the prince
3206	And all of them that thus dishonour her.
3207	
3208	ANTONIO	Here comes the prince and Claudio hastily.
3209	
3210	[Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO]
3211	
3212	DON PEDRO	Good den, good den.
3213	
3214	CLAUDIO	Good day to both of you.
3215	
3216	LEONATO	Hear you. my lords,--
3217	
3218	DON PEDRO	We have some haste, Leonato.
3219	
3220	LEONATO	Some haste, my lord! well, fare you well, my lord:
3221	Are you so hasty now? well, all is one.
3222	
3223	DON PEDRO	Nay, do not quarrel with us, good old man.
3224	
3225	ANTONIO	If he could right himself with quarreling,
3226	Some of us would lie low.
3227	
3228	CLAUDIO	Who wrongs him?
3229	
3230	LEONATO	Marry, thou dost wrong me; thou dissembler, thou:--
3231	Nay, never lay thy hand upon thy sword;
3232	I fear thee not.
3233	
3234	CLAUDIO	                  Marry, beshrew my hand,
3235	If it should give your age such cause of fear:
3236	In faith, my hand meant nothing to my sword.
3237	
3238	LEONATO	Tush, tush, man; never fleer and jest at me:
3239	I speak not like a dotard nor a fool,
3240	As under privilege of age to brag
3241	What I have done being young, or what would do
3242	Were I not old. Know, Claudio, to thy head,
3243	Thou hast so wrong'd mine innocent child and me
3244	That I am forced to lay my reverence by
3245	And, with grey hairs and bruise of many days,
3246	Do challenge thee to trial of a man.
3247	I say thou hast belied mine innocent child;
3248	Thy slander hath gone through and through her heart,
3249	And she lies buried with her ancestors;
3250	O, in a tomb where never scandal slept,
3251	Save this of hers, framed by thy villany!
3252	
3253	CLAUDIO	My villany?
3254	
3255	LEONATO	          Thine, Claudio; thine, I say.
3256	
3257	DON PEDRO	You say not right, old man.
3258	
3259	LEONATO	My lord, my lord,
3260	I'll prove it on his body, if he dare,
3261	Despite his nice fence and his active practise,
3262	His May of youth and bloom of lustihood.
3263	
3264	CLAUDIO	Away! I will not have to do with you.
3265	
3266	LEONATO	Canst thou so daff me? Thou hast kill'd my child:
3267	If thou kill'st me, boy, thou shalt kill a man.
3268	
3269	ANTONIO	He shall kill two of us, and men indeed:
3270	But that's no matter; let him kill one first;
3271	Win me and wear me; let him answer me.
3272	Come, follow me, boy; come, sir boy, come, follow me:
3273	Sir boy, I'll whip you from your foining fence;
3274	Nay, as I am a gentleman, I will.
3275	
3276	LEONATO	Brother,--
3277	
3278	ANTONIO	Content yourself. God knows I loved my niece;
3279	And she is dead, slander'd to death by villains,
3280	That dare as well answer a man indeed
3281	As I dare take a serpent by the tongue:
3282	Boys, apes, braggarts, Jacks, milksops!
3283	
3284	LEONATO	Brother Antony,--
3285	
3286	ANTONIO	Hold you content. What, man! I know them, yea,
3287	And what they weigh, even to the utmost scruple,--
3288	Scrambling, out-facing, fashion-monging boys,
3289	That lie and cog and flout, deprave and slander,
3290	Go anticly, show outward hideousness,
3291	And speak off half a dozen dangerous words,
3292	How they might hurt their enemies, if they durst;
3293	And this is all.
3294	
3295	LEONATO	But, brother Antony,--
3296	
3297	ANTONIO	Come, 'tis no matter:
3298	Do not you meddle; let me deal in this.
3299	
3300	DON PEDRO	Gentlemen both, we will not wake your patience.
3301	My heart is sorry for your daughter's death:
3302	But, on my honour, she was charged with nothing
3303	But what was true and very full of proof.
3304	
3305	LEONATO	My lord, my lord,--
3306	
3307	DON PEDRO	I will not hear you.
3308	
3309	LEONATO	No? Come, brother; away! I will be heard.
3310	
3311	ANTONIO	And shall, or some of us will smart for it.
3312	
3313	[Exeunt LEONATO and ANTONIO]
3314	
3315	DON PEDRO	See, see; here comes the man we went to seek.
3316	
3317	[Enter BENEDICK]
3318	
3319	CLAUDIO	Now, signior, what news?
3320	
3321	BENEDICK	Good day, my lord.
3322	
3323	DON PEDRO	Welcome, signior: you are almost come to part
3324	almost a fray.
3325	
3326	CLAUDIO	We had like to have had our two noses snapped off
3327	with two old men without teeth.
3328	
3329	DON PEDRO	Leonato and his brother. What thinkest thou? Had
3330	we fought, I doubt we should have been too young for them.
3331	
3332	BENEDICK	In a false quarrel there is no true valour. I came
3333	to seek you both.
3334	
3335	CLAUDIO	We have been up and down to seek thee; for we are
3336	high-proof melancholy and would fain have it beaten
3337	away. Wilt thou use thy wit?
3338	
3339	BENEDICK	It is in my scabbard: shall I draw it?
3340	
3341	DON PEDRO	Dost thou wear thy wit by thy side?
3342	
3343	CLAUDIO	Never any did so, though very many have been beside
3344	their wit. I will bid thee draw, as we do the
3345	minstrels; draw, to pleasure us.
3346	
3347	DON PEDRO	As I am an honest man, he looks pale. Art thou
3348	sick, or angry?
3349	
3350	CLAUDIO	What, courage, man! What though care killed a cat,
3351	thou hast mettle enough in thee to kill care.
3352	
3353	BENEDICK	Sir, I shall meet your wit in the career, and you
3354	charge it against me. I pray you choose another subject.
3355	
3356	CLAUDIO	Nay, then, give him another staff: this last was
3357	broke cross.
3358	
3359	DON PEDRO	By this light, he changes more and more: I think
3360	he be angry indeed.
3361	
3362	CLAUDIO	If he be, he knows how to turn his girdle.
3363	
3364	BENEDICK	Shall I speak a word in your ear?
3365	
3366	CLAUDIO	God bless me from a challenge!
3367	
3368	BENEDICK	[Aside to CLAUDIO]  You are a villain; I jest not:
3369	I will make it good how you dare, with what you
3370	dare, and when you dare. Do me right, or I will
3371	protest your cowardice. You have killed a sweet
3372	lady, and her death shall fall heavy on you. Let me
3373	hear from you.
3374	
3375	CLAUDIO	Well, I will meet you, so I may have good cheer.
3376	
3377	DON PEDRO	What, a feast, a feast?
3378	
3379	CLAUDIO	I' faith, I thank him; he hath bid me to a calf's
3380	head and a capon; the which if I do not carve most
3381	curiously, say my knife's naught. Shall I not find
3382	a woodcock too?
3383	
3384	BENEDICK	Sir, your wit ambles well; it goes easily.
3385	
3386	DON PEDRO	I'll tell thee how Beatrice praised thy wit the
3387	other day. I said, thou hadst a fine wit: 'True,'
3388	said she, 'a fine little one.' 'No,' said I, 'a
3389	great wit:' 'Right,' says she, 'a great gross one.'
3390	'Nay,' said I, 'a good wit:' 'Just,' said she, 'it
3391	hurts nobody.' 'Nay,' said I, 'the gentleman
3392	is wise:' 'Certain,' said she, 'a wise gentleman.'
3393	'Nay,' said I, 'he hath the tongues:' 'That I
3394	believe,' said she, 'for he swore a thing to me on
3395	Monday night, which he forswore on Tuesday morning;
3396	there's a double tongue; there's two tongues.' Thus
3397	did she, an hour together, transshape thy particular
3398	virtues: yet at last she concluded with a sigh, thou
3399	wast the properest man in Italy.
3400	
3401	CLAUDIO	For the which she wept heartily and said she cared
3402	not.
3403	
3404	DON PEDRO	Yea, that she did: but yet, for all that, an if she
3405	did not hate him deadly, she would love him dearly:
3406	the old man's daughter told us all.
3407	
3408	CLAUDIO	All, all; and, moreover, God saw him when he was
3409	hid in the garden.
3410	
3411	DON PEDRO	But when shall we set the savage bull's horns on
3412	the sensible Benedick's head?
3413	
3414	CLAUDIO	Yea, and text underneath, 'Here dwells Benedick the
3415	married man'?
3416	
3417	BENEDICK	Fare you well, boy: you know my mind. I will leave
3418	you now to your gossip-like humour: you break jests
3419	as braggarts do their blades, which God be thanked,
3420	hurt not. My lord, for your many courtesies I thank
3421	you: I must discontinue your company: your brother
3422	the bastard is fled from Messina: you have among
3423	you killed a sweet and innocent lady. For my Lord
3424	Lackbeard there, he and I shall meet: and, till
3425	then, peace be with him.
3426	
3427	[Exit]
3428	
3429	DON PEDRO	He is in earnest.
3430	
3431	CLAUDIO	In most profound earnest; and, I'll warrant you, for
3432	the love of Beatrice.
3433	
3434	DON PEDRO	And hath challenged thee.
3435	
3436	CLAUDIO	Most sincerely.
3437	
3438	DON PEDRO	What a pretty thing man is when he goes in his
3439	doublet and hose and leaves off his wit!
3440	
3441	CLAUDIO	He is then a giant to an ape; but then is an ape a
3442	doctor to such a man.
3443	
3444	DON PEDRO	But, soft you, let me be: pluck up, my heart, and
3445	be sad. Did he not say, my brother was fled?
3446	
3447	[Enter DOGBERRY, VERGES, and the Watch, with CONRADE
3448	and BORACHIO]
3449	
3450	DOGBERRY	Come you, sir: if justice cannot tame you, she
3451	shall ne'er weigh more reasons in her balance: nay,
3452	an you be a cursing hypocrite once, you must be looked to.
3453	
3454	DON PEDRO	How now? two of my brother's men bound! Borachio
3455	one!
3456	
3457	CLAUDIO	Hearken after their offence, my lord.
3458	
3459	DON PEDRO	Officers, what offence have these men done?
3460	
3461	DOGBERRY	Marry, sir, they have committed false report;
3462	moreover, they have spoken untruths; secondarily,
3463	they are slanders; sixth and lastly, they have
3464	belied a lady; thirdly, they have verified unjust
3465	things; and, to conclude, they are lying knaves.
3466	
3467	DON PEDRO	First, I ask thee what they have done; thirdly, I
3468	ask thee what's their offence; sixth and lastly, why
3469	they are committed; and, to conclude, what you lay
3470	to their charge.
3471	
3472	CLAUDIO	Rightly reasoned, and in his own division: and, by
3473	my troth, there's one meaning well suited.
3474	
3475	DON PEDRO	Who have you offended, masters, that you are thus
3476	bound to your answer? this learned constable is
3477	too cunning to be understood: what's your offence?
3478	
3479	BORACHIO	Sweet prince, let me go no farther to mine answer:
3480	do you hear me, and let this count kill me. I have
3481	deceived even your very eyes: what your wisdoms
3482	could not discover, these shallow fools have brought
3483	to light: who in the night overheard me confessing
3484	to this man how Don John your brother incensed me
3485	to slander the Lady Hero, how you were brought into
3486	the orchard and saw me court Margaret in Hero's
3487	garments, how you disgraced her, when you should
3488	marry her: my villany they have upon record; which
3489	I had rather seal with my death than repeat over
3490	to my shame. The lady is dead upon mine and my
3491	master's false accusation; and, briefly, I desire
3492	nothing but the reward of a villain.
3493	
3494	DON PEDRO	Runs not this speech like iron through your blood?
3495	
3496	CLAUDIO	I have drunk poison whiles he utter'd it.
3497	
3498	DON PEDRO	But did my brother set thee on to this?
3499	
3500	BORACHIO	Yea, and paid me richly for the practise of it.
3501	
3502	DON PEDRO	He is composed and framed of treachery:
3503	And fled he is upon this villany.
3504	
3505	CLAUDIO	Sweet Hero! now thy image doth appear
3506	In the rare semblance that I loved it first.
3507	
3508	DOGBERRY	Come, bring away the plaintiffs: by this time our
3509	sexton hath reformed Signior Leonato of the matter:
3510	and, masters, do not forget to specify, when time
3511	and place shall serve, that I am an ass.
3512	
3513	VERGES	Here, here comes master Signior Leonato, and the
3514	Sexton too.
3515	
3516	[Re-enter LEONATO and ANTONIO, with the Sexton]
3517	
3518	LEONATO	Which is the villain? let me see his eyes,
3519	That, when I note another man like him,
3520	I may avoid him: which of these is he?
3521	
3522	BORACHIO	If you would know your wronger, look on me.
3523	
3524	LEONATO	Art thou the slave that with thy breath hast kill'd
3525	Mine innocent child?
3526	
3527	BORACHIO	Yea, even I alone.
3528	
3529	LEONATO	No, not so, villain; thou beliest thyself:
3530	Here stand a pair of honourable men;
3531	A third is fled, that had a hand in it.
3532	I thank you, princes, for my daughter's death:
3533	Record it with your high and worthy deeds:
3534	'Twas bravely done, if you bethink you of it.
3535	
3536	CLAUDIO	I know not how to pray your patience;
3537	Yet I must speak. Choose your revenge yourself;
3538	Impose me to what penance your invention
3539	Can lay upon my sin: yet sinn'd I not
3540	But in mistaking.
3541	
3542	DON PEDRO	                  By my soul, nor I:
3543	And yet, to satisfy this good old man,
3544	I would bend under any heavy weight
3545	That he'll enjoin me to.
3546	
3547	LEONATO	I cannot bid you bid my daughter live;
3548	That were impossible: but, I pray you both,
3549	Possess the people in Messina here
3550	How innocent she died; and if your love
3551	Can labour ought in sad invention,
3552	Hang her an epitaph upon her tomb
3553	And sing it to her bones, sing it to-night:
3554	To-morrow morning come you to my house,
3555	And since you could not be my son-in-law,
3556	Be yet my nephew: my brother hath a daughter,
3557	Almost the copy of my child that's dead,
3558	And she alone is heir to both of us:
3559	Give her the right you should have given her cousin,
3560	And so dies my revenge.
3561	
3562	CLAUDIO	O noble sir,
3563	Your over-kindness doth wring tears from me!
3564	I do embrace your offer; and dispose
3565	For henceforth of poor Claudio.
3566	
3567	LEONATO	To-morrow then I will expect your coming;
3568	To-night I take my leave. This naughty man
3569	Shall face to face be brought to Margaret,
3570	Who I believe was pack'd in all this wrong,
3571	Hired to it by your brother.
3572	
3573	BORACHIO	No, by my soul, she was not,
3574	Nor knew not what she did when she spoke to me,
3575	But always hath been just and virtuous
3576	In any thing that I do know by her.
3577	
3578	DOGBERRY	Moreover, sir, which indeed is not under white and
3579	black, this plaintiff here, the offender, did call
3580	me ass: I beseech you, let it be remembered in his
3581	punishment. And also, the watch heard them talk of
3582	one Deformed: they say be wears a key in his ear and
3583	a lock hanging by it, and borrows money in God's
3584	name, the which he hath used so long and never paid
3585	that now men grow hard-hearted and will lend nothing
3586	for God's sake: pray you, examine him upon that point.
3587	
3588	LEONATO	I thank thee for thy care and honest pains.
3589	
3590	DOGBERRY	Your worship speaks like a most thankful and
3591	reverend youth; and I praise God for you.
3592	
3593	LEONATO	There's for thy pains.
3594	
3595	DOGBERRY	God save the foundation!
3596	
3597	LEONATO	Go, I discharge thee of thy prisoner, and I thank thee.
3598	
3599	DOGBERRY	I leave an arrant knave with your worship; which I
3600	beseech your worship to correct yourself, for the
3601	example of others. God keep your worship! I wish
3602	your worship well; God restore you to health! I
3603	humbly give you leave to depart; and if a merry
3604	meeting may be wished, God prohibit it! Come, neighbour.
3605	
3606	[Exeunt DOGBERRY and VERGES]
3607	
3608	LEONATO	Until to-morrow morning, lords, farewell.
3609	
3610	ANTONIO	Farewell, my lords: we look for you to-morrow.
3611	
3612	DON PEDRO	We will not fail.
3613	
3614	CLAUDIO	                  To-night I'll mourn with Hero.
3615	
3616	LEONATO	[To the Watch]  Bring you these fellows on. We'll
3617	talk with Margaret,
3618	How her acquaintance grew with this lewd fellow.
3619	
3620	[Exeunt, severally]
3621	
3622	
3623	
3624	
3625	MUCH ADO ABOUT NOTHING

3627	
3628	ACT V
3629	
3630	
3631	
3632	SCENE II	LEONATO'S garden.
3633	
3634	
3635	[Enter BENEDICK and MARGARET, meeting]
3636	
3637	BENEDICK	Pray thee, sweet Mistress Margaret, deserve well at
3638	my hands by helping me to the speech of Beatrice.
3639	
3640	MARGARET	Will you then write me a sonnet in praise of my beauty?
3641	
3642	BENEDICK	In so high a style, Margaret, that no man living
3643	shall come over it; for, in most comely truth, thou
3644	deservest it.
3645	
3646	MARGARET	To have no man come over me! why, shall I always
3647	keep below stairs?
3648	
3649	BENEDICK	Thy wit is as quick as the greyhound's mouth; it catches.
3650	
3651	MARGARET	And yours as blunt as the fencer's foils, which hit,
3652	but hurt not.
3653	
3654	BENEDICK	A most manly wit, Margaret; it will not hurt a
3655	woman: and so, I pray thee, call Beatrice: I give
3656	thee the bucklers.
3657	
3658	MARGARET	Give us the swords; we have bucklers of our own.
3659	
3660	BENEDICK	If you use them, Margaret, you must put in the
3661	pikes with a vice; and they are dangerous weapons for maids.
3662	
3663	MARGARET	Well, I will call Beatrice to you, who I think hath legs.
3664	
3665	BENEDICK	And therefore will come.
3666	
3667	[Exit MARGARET]
3668	
3669	[Sings]
3670	
3671	The god of love,
3672	That sits above,
3673	And knows me, and knows me,
3674	How pitiful I deserve,--
3675	
3676	I mean in singing; but in loving, Leander the good
3677	swimmer, Troilus the first employer of panders, and
3678	a whole bookful of these quondam carpet-mangers,
3679	whose names yet run smoothly in the even road of a
3680	blank verse, why, they were never so truly turned
3681	over and over as my poor self in love. Marry, I
3682	cannot show it in rhyme; I have tried: I can find
3683	out no rhyme to 'lady' but 'baby,' an innocent
3684	rhyme; for 'scorn,' 'horn,' a hard rhyme; for,
3685	'school,' 'fool,' a babbling rhyme; very ominous
3686	endings: no, I was not born under a rhyming planet,
3687	nor I cannot woo in festival terms.
3688	
3689	[Enter BEATRICE]
3690	
3691	Sweet Beatrice, wouldst thou come when I called thee?
3692	
3693	BEATRICE	Yea, signior, and depart when you bid me.
3694	
3695	BENEDICK	O, stay but till then!
3696	
3697	BEATRICE	'Then' is spoken; fare you well now: and yet, ere
3698	I go, let me go with that I came; which is, with
3699	knowing what hath passed between you and Claudio.
3700	
3701	BENEDICK	Only foul words; and thereupon I will kiss thee.
3702	
3703	BEATRICE	Foul words is but foul wind, and foul wind is but
3704	foul breath, and foul breath is noisome; therefore I
3705	will depart unkissed.
3706	
3707	BENEDICK	Thou hast frighted the word out of his right sense,
3708	so forcible is thy wit. But I must tell thee
3709	plainly, Claudio undergoes my challenge; and either
3710	I must shortly hear from him, or I will subscribe
3711	him a coward. And, I pray thee now, tell me for
3712	which of my bad parts didst thou first fall in love with me?
3713	
3714	BEATRICE	For them all together; which maintained so politic
3715	a state of evil that they will not admit any good
3716	part to intermingle with them. But for which of my
3717	good parts did you first suffer love for me?
3718	
3719	BENEDICK	Suffer love! a good epithet! I do suffer love
3720	indeed, for I love thee against my will.
3721	
3722	BEATRICE	In spite of your heart, I think; alas, poor heart!
3723	If you spite it for my sake, I will spite it for
3724	yours; for I will never love that which my friend hates.
3725	
3726	BENEDICK	Thou and I are too wise to woo peaceably.
3727	
3728	BEATRICE	It appears not in this confession: there's not one
3729	wise man among twenty that will praise himself.
3730	
3731	BENEDICK	An old, an old instance, Beatrice, that lived in
3732	the lime of good neighbours. If a man do not erect
3733	in this age his own tomb ere he dies, he shall live
3734	no longer in monument than the bell rings and the
3735	widow weeps.
3736	
3737	BEATRICE	And how long is that, think you?
3738	
3739	BENEDICK	Question: why, an hour in clamour and a quarter in
3740	rheum: therefore is it most expedient for the
3741	wise, if Don Worm, his conscience, find no
3742	impediment to the contrary, to be the trumpet of his
3743	own virtues, as I am to myself. So much for
3744	praising myself, who, I myself will bear witness, is
3745	praiseworthy: and now tell me, how doth your cousin?
3746	
3747	BEATRICE	Very ill.
3748	
3749	BENEDICK	And how do you?
3750	
3751	BEATRICE	Very ill too.
3752	
3753	BENEDICK	Serve God, love me and mend. There will I leave
3754	you too, for here comes one in haste.
3755	
3756	[Enter URSULA]
3757	
3758	URSULA	Madam, you must come to your uncle. Yonder's old
3759	coil at home: it is proved my Lady Hero hath been
3760	falsely accused, the prince and Claudio mightily
3761	abused; and Don John is the author of all, who is
3762	fed and gone. Will you come presently?
3763	
3764	BEATRICE	Will you go hear this news, signior?
3765	
3766	BENEDICK	I will live in thy heart, die in thy lap, and be
3767	buried in thy eyes; and moreover I will go with
3768	thee to thy uncle's.
3769

3782	SCENE III	A church.
3783	
3784	
3785	[Enter DON PEDRO, CLAUDIO, and three or four
3786	with tapers]
3787	
3788	CLAUDIO	Is this the monument of Leonato?
3789	
3790	Lord	It is, my lord.
3791	
3792	CLAUDIO	[Reading out of a scroll]
3793	Done to death by slanderous tongues
3794	Was the Hero that here lies:
3795	Death, in guerdon of her wrongs,
3796	Gives her fame which never dies.
3797	So the life that died with shame
3798	Lives in death with glorious fame.
3799	Hang thou there upon the tomb,
3800	Praising her when I am dumb.
3801	
3802	Now, music, sound, and sing your solemn hymn.
3803	SONG.
3804	
3805	Pardon, goddess of the night,
3806	Those that slew thy virgin knight;
3807	For the which, with songs of woe,
3808	Round about her tomb they go.
3809	Midnight, assist our moan;
3810	Help us to sigh and groan,
3811	Heavily, heavily:
3812	Graves, yawn and yield your dead,
3813	Till death be uttered,
3814	Heavily, heavily.
3815	
3816	CLAUDIO	     Now, unto thy bones good night!
3817	Yearly will I do this rite.
3818	
3819	DON PEDRO	Good morrow, masters; put your torches out:
3820	The wolves have prey'd; and look, the gentle day,
3821	Before the wheels of Phoebus, round about
3822	Dapples the drowsy east with spots of grey.
3823	Thanks to you all, and leave us: fare you well.
3824	
3825	CLAUDIO	     Good morrow, masters: each his several way.
3826	
3827	DON PEDRO	Come, let us hence, and put on other weeds;
3828	And then to Leonato's we will go.
3829	
3830	CLAUDIO	And Hymen now with luckier issue speed's
3831	Than this for whom we render'd up this woe.

3841	ACT V
3842	
3843	
3844	
3845	SCENE IV	A room in LEONATO'S house.
3846	
3847	
3848	[Enter LEONATO, ANTONIO, BENEDICK, BEATRICE,
3849	MARGARET, URSULA, FRIAR FRANCIS, and HERO]
3850	
3851	FRIAR FRANCIS	Did I not tell you she was innocent?
3852	
3853	LEONATO	So are the prince and Claudio, who accused her
3854	Upon the error that you heard debated:
3855	But Margaret was in some fault for this,
3856	Although against her will, as it appears
3857	In the true course of all the question.
3858	
3859	ANTONIO	Well, I am glad that all things sort so well.
3860	
3861	BENEDICK	And so am I, being else by faith enforced
3862	To call young Claudio to a reckoning for it.
3863	
3864	LEONATO	Well, daughter, and you gentle-women all,
3865	Withdraw into a chamber by yourselves,
3866	And when I send for you, come hither mask'd.
3867	
3868	[Exeunt Ladies]
3869	
3870	The prince and Claudio promised by this hour
3871	To visit me. You know your office, brother:
3872	You must be father to your brother's daughter
3873	And give her to young Claudio.
3874	
3875	ANTONIO	Which I will do with confirm'd countenance.
3876	
3877	BENEDICK	Friar, I must entreat your pains, I think.
3878	
3879	FRIAR FRANCIS	To do what, signior?
3880	
3881	BENEDICK	To bind me, or undo me; one of them.
3882	Signior Leonato, truth it is, good signior,
3883	Your niece regards me with an eye of favour.
3884	
3885	LEONATO	That eye my daughter lent her: 'tis most true.
3886	
3887	BENEDICK	And I do with an eye of love requite her.
3888	
3889	LEONATO	The sight whereof I think you had from me,
3890	From Claudio and the prince: but what's your will?
3891	
3892	BENEDICK	Your answer, sir, is enigmatical:
3893	But, for my will, my will is your good will
3894	May stand with ours, this day to be conjoin'd
3895	In the state of honourable marriage:
3896	In which, good friar, I shall desire your help.
3897	
3898	LEONATO	My heart is with your liking.
3899	
3900	FRIAR FRANCIS	And my help.
3901	Here comes the prince and Claudio.
3902	
3903	[Enter DON PEDRO and CLAUDIO, and two or
3904	three others]
3905	
3906	DON PEDRO	Good morrow to this fair assembly.
3907	
3908	LEONATO	Good morrow, prince; good morrow, Claudio:
3909	We here attend you. Are you yet determined
3910	To-day to marry with my brother's daughter?
3911	
3912	CLAUDIO	I'll hold my mind, were she an Ethiope.
3913	
3914	LEONATO	Call her forth, brother; here's the friar ready.
3915	
3916	[Exit ANTONIO]
3917	
3918	DON PEDRO	Good morrow, Benedick. Why, what's the matter,
3919	That you have such a February face,
3920	So full of frost, of storm and cloudiness?
3921	
3922	CLAUDIO	I think he thinks upon the savage bull.
3923	Tush, fear not, man; we'll tip thy horns with gold
3924	And all Europa shall rejoice at thee,
3925	As once Europa did at lusty Jove,
3926	When he would play the noble beast in love.
3927	
3928	BENEDICK	Bull Jove, sir, had an amiable low;
3929	And some such strange bull leap'd your father's cow,
3930	And got a calf in that same noble feat
3931	Much like to you, for you have just his bleat.
3932	
3933	CLAUDIO	For this I owe you: here comes other reckonings.
3934	
3935	[Re-enter ANTONIO, with the Ladies masked]
3936	
3937	Which is the lady I must seize upon?
3938	
3939	ANTONIO	This same is she, and I do give you her.
3940	
3941	CLAUDIO	Why, then she's mine. Sweet, let me see your face.
3942	
3943	LEONATO	No, that you shall not, till you take her hand
3944	Before this friar and swear to marry her.
3945	
3946	CLAUDIO	Give me your hand: before this holy friar,
3947	I am your husband, if you like of me.
3948	
3949	HERO	And when I lived, I was your other wife:
3950	
3951	[Unmasking]
3952	
3953	And when you loved, you were my other husband.
3954	
3955	CLAUDIO	Another Hero!
3956	
3957	HERO	                  Nothing certainer:
3958	One Hero died defiled, but I do live,
3959	And surely as I live, I am a maid.
3960	
3961	DON PEDRO	The former Hero! Hero that is dead!
3962	
3963	LEONATO	She died, my lord, but whiles her slander lived.
3964	
3965	FRIAR FRANCIS	All this amazement can I qualify:
3966	When after that the holy rites are ended,
3967	I'll tell you largely of fair Hero's death:
3968	Meantime let wonder seem familiar,
3969	And to the chapel let us presently.
3970	
3971	BENEDICK	Soft and fair, friar. Which is Beatrice?
3972	
3973	BEATRICE	[Unmasking]  I answer to that name. What is your will?
3974	
3975	BENEDICK	Do not you love me?
3976	
3977	BEATRICE	Why, no; no more than reason.
3978	
3979	BENEDICK	Why, then your uncle and the prince and Claudio
3980	Have been deceived; they swore you did.
3981	
3982	BEATRICE	Do not you love me?
3983	
3984	BENEDICK	Troth, no; no more than reason.
3985	
3986	BEATRICE	Why, then my cousin Margaret and Ursula
3987	Are much deceived; for they did swear you did.
3988	
3989	BENEDICK	They swore that you were almost sick for me.
3990	
3991	BEATRICE	They swore that you were well-nigh dead for me.
3992	
3993	BENEDICK	'Tis no such matter. Then you do not love me?
3994	
3995	BEATRICE	No, truly, but in friendly recompense.
3996	
3997	LEONATO	Come, cousin, I am sure you love the gentleman.
3998	
3999	CLAUDIO	And I'll be sworn upon't that he loves her;
4000	For here's a paper written in his hand,
4001	A halting sonnet of his own pure brain,
4002	Fashion'd to Beatrice.
4003	
4004	HERO	And here's another
4005	Writ in my cousin's hand, stolen from her pocket,
4006	Containing her affection unto Benedick.
4007	
4008	BENEDICK	A miracle! here's our own hands against our hearts.
4009	Come, I will have thee; but, by this light, I take
4010	thee for pity.
4011	
4012	BEATRICE	I would not deny you; but, by this good day, I yield
4013	upon great persuasion; and partly to save your life,
4014	for I was told you were in a consumption.
4015	
4016	BENEDICK	Peace! I will stop your mouth.
4017	
4018	[Kissing her]
4019	
4020	DON PEDRO	How dost thou, Benedick, the married man?
4021	
4022	BENEDICK	I'll tell thee what, prince; a college of
4023	wit-crackers cannot flout me out of my humour. Dost
4024	thou think I  care for a satire or an epigram? No:
4025	if a man will be beaten with brains, a' shall wear
4026	nothing handsome about him. In brief, since I do
4027	purpose to marry, I will think nothing to any
4028	purpose that the world can say against it; and
4029	therefore never flout at me for what I have said
4030	against it; for man is a giddy thing, and this is my
4031	conclusion. For thy part, Claudio, I did think to
4032	have beaten thee, but in that thou art like to be my
4033	kinsman, live unbruised and love my cousin.
4034	
4035	CLAUDIO	I had well hoped thou wouldst have denied Beatrice,
4036	that I might have cudgelled thee out of thy single
4037	life, to make thee a double-dealer; which, out of
4038	question, thou wilt be, if my cousin do not look
4039	exceedingly narrowly to thee.
4040	
4041	BENEDICK	Come, come, we are friends: let's have a dance ere
4042	we are married, that we may lighten our own hearts
4043	and our wives' heels.
4044	
4045	LEONATO	We'll have dancing afterward.
4046	
4047	BENEDICK	First, of my word; therefore play, music. Prince,
4048	thou art sad; get thee a wife, get thee a wife:
4049	there is no staff more reverend than one tipped with horn.
4050	
4051	[Enter a Messenger]
4052	
4053	Messenger	My lord, your brother John is ta'en in flight,
4054	And brought with armed men back to Messina.
4055	
4056	BENEDICK	Think not on him till to-morrow:
4057	I'll devise thee brave punishments for him.
4058	Strike up, pipers.
4059	
4060	[Dance]
4061	
4062	[Exeunt]

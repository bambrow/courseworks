70	ACT I
71	
72	
73	
74	SCENE I	KING JOHN'S palace.
75	
76	
77	[Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, PEMBROKE, ESSEX,
78	SALISBURY, and others, with CHATILLON]
79	
80	KING JOHN	Now, say, Chatillon, what would France with us?
81	
82	CHATILLON	Thus, after greeting, speaks the King of France
83	In my behavior to the majesty,
84	The borrow'd majesty, of England here.
85	
86	QUEEN ELINOR	A strange beginning: 'borrow'd majesty!'
87	
88	KING JOHN	Silence, good mother; hear the embassy.
89	
90	CHATILLON	Philip of France, in right and true behalf
91	Of thy deceased brother Geffrey's son,
92	Arthur Plantagenet, lays most lawful claim
93	To this fair island and the territories,
94	To Ireland, Poictiers, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
95	Desiring thee to lay aside the sword
96	Which sways usurpingly these several titles,
97	And put these same into young Arthur's hand,
98	Thy nephew and right royal sovereign.
99	
100	KING JOHN	What follows if we disallow of this?
101	
102	CHATILLON	The proud control of fierce and bloody war,
103	To enforce these rights so forcibly withheld.
104	
105	KING JOHN	Here have we war for war and blood for blood,
106	Controlment for controlment: so answer France.
107	
108	CHATILLON	Then take my king's defiance from my mouth,
109	The farthest limit of my embassy.
110	
111	KING JOHN	Bear mine to him, and so depart in peace:
112	Be thou as lightning in the eyes of France;
113	For ere thou canst report I will be there,
114	The thunder of my cannon shall be heard:
115	So hence! Be thou the trumpet of our wrath
116	And sullen presage of your own decay.
117	An honourable conduct let him have:
118	Pembroke, look to 't. Farewell, Chatillon.
119	
120	[Exeunt CHATILLON and PEMBROKE]
121	
122	QUEEN ELINOR	What now, my son! have I not ever said
123	How that ambitious Constance would not cease
124	Till she had kindled France and all the world,
125	Upon the right and party of her son?
126	This might have been prevented and made whole
127	With very easy arguments of love,
128	Which now the manage of two kingdoms must
129	With fearful bloody issue arbitrate.
130	
131	KING JOHN	Our strong possession and our right for us.
132	
133	QUEEN ELINOR	Your strong possession much more than your right,
134	Or else it must go wrong with you and me:
135	So much my conscience whispers in your ear,
136	Which none but heaven and you and I shall hear.
137	
138	[Enter a Sheriff]
139	
140	ESSEX	My liege, here is the strangest controversy
141	Come from country to be judged by you,
142	That e'er I heard: shall I produce the men?
143	
144	KING JOHN	Let them approach.
145	Our abbeys and our priories shall pay
146	This expedition's charge.
147	
148	[Enter ROBERT and the BASTARD]
149	
150	What men are you?
151	
152	BASTARD	Your faithful subject I, a gentleman
153	Born in Northamptonshire and eldest son,
154	As I suppose, to Robert Faulconbridge,
155	A soldier, by the honour-giving hand
156	Of Coeur-de-lion knighted in the field.
157	
158	KING JOHN	What art thou?
159	
160	ROBERT	The son and heir to that same Faulconbridge.
161	
162	KING JOHN	Is that the elder, and art thou the heir?
163	You came not of one mother then, it seems.
164	
165	BASTARD	Most certain of one mother, mighty king;
166	That is well known; and, as I think, one father:
167	But for the certain knowledge of that truth
168	I put you o'er to heaven and to my mother:
169	Of that I doubt, as all men's children may.
170	
171	QUEEN ELINOR	Out on thee, rude man! thou dost shame thy mother
172	And wound her honour with this diffidence.
173	
174	BASTARD	I, madam? no, I have no reason for it;
175	That is my brother's plea and none of mine;
176	The which if he can prove, a' pops me out
177	At least from fair five hundred pound a year:
178	Heaven guard my mother's honour and my land!
179	
180	KING JOHN	A good blunt fellow. Why, being younger born,
181	Doth he lay claim to thine inheritance?
182	
183	BASTARD	I know not why, except to get the land.
184	But once he slander'd me with bastardy:
185	But whether I be as true begot or no,
186	That still I lay upon my mother's head,
187	But that I am as well begot, my liege,--
188	Fair fall the bones that took the pains for me!--
189	Compare our faces and be judge yourself.
190	If old sir Robert did beget us both
191	And were our father and this son like him,
192	O old sir Robert, father, on my knee
193	I give heaven thanks I was not like to thee!
194	
195	KING JOHN	Why, what a madcap hath heaven lent us here!
196	
197	QUEEN ELINOR	He hath a trick of Coeur-de-lion's face;
198	The accent of his tongue affecteth him.
199	Do you not read some tokens of my son
200	In the large composition of this man?
201	
202	KING JOHN	Mine eye hath well examined his parts
203	And finds them perfect Richard. Sirrah, speak,
204	What doth move you to claim your brother's land?
205	
206	BASTARD	Because he hath a half-face, like my father.
207	With half that face would he have all my land:
208	A half-faced groat five hundred pound a year!
209	
210	ROBERT	My gracious liege, when that my father lived,
211	Your brother did employ my father much,--
212	
213	BASTARD	Well, sir, by this you cannot get my land:
214	Your tale must be how he employ'd my mother.
215	
216	ROBERT	And once dispatch'd him in an embassy
217	To Germany, there with the emperor
218	To treat of high affairs touching that time.
219	The advantage of his absence took the king
220	And in the mean time sojourn'd at my father's;
221	Where how he did prevail I shame to speak,
222	But truth is truth: large lengths of seas and shores
223	Between my father and my mother lay,
224	As I have heard my father speak himself,
225	When this same lusty gentleman was got.
226	Upon his death-bed he by will bequeath'd
227	His lands to me, and took it on his death
228	That this my mother's son was none of his;
229	And if he were, he came into the world
230	Full fourteen weeks before the course of time.
231	Then, good my liege, let me have what is mine,
232	My father's land, as was my father's will.
233	
234	KING JOHN	Sirrah, your brother is legitimate;
235	Your father's wife did after wedlock bear him,
236	And if she did play false, the fault was hers;
237	Which fault lies on the hazards of all husbands
238	That marry wives. Tell me, how if my brother,
239	Who, as you say, took pains to get this son,
240	Had of your father claim'd this son for his?
241	In sooth, good friend, your father might have kept
242	This calf bred from his cow from all the world;
243	In sooth he might; then, if he were my brother's,
244	My brother might not claim him; nor your father,
245	Being none of his, refuse him: this concludes;
246	My mother's son did get your father's heir;
247	Your father's heir must have your father's land.
248	
249	ROBERT	Shall then my father's will be of no force
250	To dispossess that child which is not his?
251	
252	BASTARD	Of no more force to dispossess me, sir,
253	Than was his will to get me, as I think.
254	
255	QUEEN ELINOR	Whether hadst thou rather be a Faulconbridge
256	And like thy brother, to enjoy thy land,
257	Or the reputed son of Coeur-de-lion,
258	Lord of thy presence and no land beside?
259	
260	BASTARD	Madam, an if my brother had my shape,
261	And I had his, sir Robert's his, like him;
262	And if my legs were two such riding-rods,
263	My arms such eel-skins stuff'd, my face so thin
264	That in mine ear I durst not stick a rose
265	Lest men should say 'Look, where three-farthings goes!'
266	And, to his shape, were heir to all this land,
267	Would I might never stir from off this place,
268	I would give it every foot to have this face;
269	I would not be sir Nob in any case.
270	
271	QUEEN ELINOR	I like thee well: wilt thou forsake thy fortune,
272	Bequeath thy land to him and follow me?
273	I am a soldier and now bound to France.
274	
275	BASTARD	Brother, take you my land, I'll take my chance.
276	Your face hath got five hundred pound a year,
277	Yet sell your face for five pence and 'tis dear.
278	Madam, I'll follow you unto the death.
279	
280	QUEEN ELINOR	Nay, I would have you go before me thither.
281	
282	BASTARD	Our country manners give our betters way.
283	
284	KING JOHN	What is thy name?
285	
286	BASTARD	Philip, my liege, so is my name begun,
287	Philip, good old sir Robert's wife's eldest son.
288	
289	KING JOHN	From henceforth bear his name whose form thou bear'st:
290	Kneel thou down Philip, but rise more great,
291	Arise sir Richard and Plantagenet.
292	
293	BASTARD	Brother by the mother's side, give me your hand:
294	My father gave me honour, yours gave land.
295	Now blessed by the hour, by night or day,
296	When I was got, sir Robert was away!
297	
298	QUEEN ELINOR	The very spirit of Plantagenet!
299	I am thy grandam, Richard; call me so.
300	
301	BASTARD	Madam, by chance but not by truth; what though?
302	Something about, a little from the right,
303	In at the window, or else o'er the hatch:
304	Who dares not stir by day must walk by night,
305	And have is have, however men do catch:
306	Near or far off, well won is still well shot,
307	And I am I, howe'er I was begot.
308	
309	KING JOHN	Go, Faulconbridge: now hast thou thy desire;
310	A landless knight makes thee a landed squire.
311	Come, madam, and come, Richard, we must speed
312	For France, for France, for it is more than need.
313	
314	BASTARD	Brother, adieu: good fortune come to thee!
315	For thou wast got i' the way of honesty.
316	
317	[Exeunt all but BASTARD]
318	
319	A foot of honour better than I was;
320	But many a many foot of land the worse.
321	Well, now can I make any Joan a lady.
322	'Good den, sir Richard!'--'God-a-mercy, fellow!'--
323	And if his name be George, I'll call him Peter;
324	For new-made honour doth forget men's names;
325	'Tis too respective and too sociable
326	For your conversion. Now your traveller,
327	He and his toothpick at my worship's mess,
328	And when my knightly stomach is sufficed,
329	Why then I suck my teeth and catechise
330	My picked man of countries: 'My dear sir,'
331	Thus, leaning on mine elbow, I begin,
332	'I shall beseech you'--that is question now;
333	And then comes answer like an Absey book:
334	'O sir,' says answer, 'at your best command;
335	At your employment; at your service, sir;'
336	'No, sir,' says question, 'I, sweet sir, at yours:'
337	And so, ere answer knows what question would,
338	Saving in dialogue of compliment,
339	And talking of the Alps and Apennines,
340	The Pyrenean and the river Po,
341	It draws toward supper in conclusion so.
342	But this is worshipful society
343	And fits the mounting spirit like myself,
344	For he is but a bastard to the time
345	That doth not smack of observation;
346	And so am I, whether I smack or no;
347	And not alone in habit and device,
348	Exterior form, outward accoutrement,
349	But from the inward motion to deliver
350	Sweet, sweet, sweet poison for the age's tooth:
351	Which, though I will not practise to deceive,
352	Yet, to avoid deceit, I mean to learn;
353	For it shall strew the footsteps of my rising.
354	But who comes in such haste in riding-robes?
355	What woman-post is this? hath she no husband
356	That will take pains to blow a horn before her?
357	
358	[Enter LADY FAULCONBRIDGE and GURNEY]
359	
360	O me! it is my mother. How now, good lady!
361	What brings you here to court so hastily?
362	
363	LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Where is that slave, thy brother? where is he,
364	That holds in chase mine honour up and down?
365	
366	BASTARD	My brother Robert? old sir Robert's son?
367	Colbrand the giant, that same mighty man?
368	Is it sir Robert's son that you seek so?
369	
370	LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Sir Robert's son! Ay, thou unreverend boy,
371	Sir Robert's son: why scorn'st thou at sir Robert?
372	He is sir Robert's son, and so art thou.
373	
374	BASTARD	James Gurney, wilt thou give us leave awhile?
375	
376	GURNEY	Good leave, good Philip.
377	
378	BASTARD	Philip! sparrow: James,
379	There's toys abroad: anon I'll tell thee more.
380	
381	[Exit GURNEY]
382	
383	Madam, I was not old sir Robert's son:
384	Sir Robert might have eat his part in me
385	Upon Good-Friday and ne'er broke his fast:
386	Sir Robert could do well: marry, to confess,
387	Could he get me? Sir Robert could not do it:
388	We know his handiwork: therefore, good mother,
389	To whom am I beholding for these limbs?
390	Sir Robert never holp to make this leg.
391	
392	LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou conspired with thy brother too,
393	That for thine own gain shouldst defend mine honour?
394	What means this scorn, thou most untoward knave?
395	
396	BASTARD	Knight, knight, good mother, Basilisco-like.
397	What! I am dubb'd! I have it on my shoulder.
398	But, mother, I am not sir Robert's son;
399	I have disclaim'd sir Robert and my land;
400	Legitimation, name and all is gone:
401	Then, good my mother, let me know my father;
402	Some proper man, I hope: who was it, mother?
403	
404	LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	Hast thou denied thyself a Faulconbridge?
405	
406	BASTARD	As faithfully as I deny the devil.
407	
408	LADY FAULCONBRIDGE	King Richard Coeur-de-lion was thy father:
409	By long and vehement suit I was seduced
410	To make room for him in my husband's bed:
411	Heaven lay not my transgression to my charge!
412	Thou art the issue of my dear offence,
413	Which was so strongly urged past my defence.
414	
415	BASTARD	Now, by this light, were I to get again,
416	Madam, I would not wish a better father.
417	Some sins do bear their privilege on earth,
418	And so doth yours; your fault was not your folly:
419	Needs must you lay your heart at his dispose,
420	Subjected tribute to commanding love,
421	Against whose fury and unmatched force
422	The aweless lion could not wage the fight,
423	Nor keep his princely heart from Richard's hand.
424	He that perforce robs lions of their hearts
425	May easily win a woman's. Ay, my mother,
426	With all my heart I thank thee for my father!
427	Who lives and dares but say thou didst not well
428	When I was got, I'll send his soul to hell.
429	Come, lady, I will show thee to my kin;
430	And they shall say, when Richard me begot,
431	If thou hadst said him nay, it had been sin:
432	Who says it was, he lies; I say 'twas not.

442	ACT II
443	
444	
445	
446	SCENE I	France. Before Angiers.
447	
448	
449	[Enter AUSTRIA and forces, drums, etc. on one side:
450	on the other KING PHILIP and his power; LEWIS,
451	ARTHUR, CONSTANCE and attendants]
452	
453	LEWIS	Before Angiers well met, brave Austria.
454	Arthur, that great forerunner of thy blood,
455	Richard, that robb'd the lion of his heart
456	And fought the holy wars in Palestine,
457	By this brave duke came early to his grave:
458	And for amends to his posterity,
459	At our importance hither is he come,
460	To spread his colours, boy, in thy behalf,
461	And to rebuke the usurpation
462	Of thy unnatural uncle, English John:
463	Embrace him, love him, give him welcome hither.
464	
465	ARTHUR	God shall forgive you Coeur-de-lion's death
466	The rather that you give his offspring life,
467	Shadowing their right under your wings of war:
468	I give you welcome with a powerless hand,
469	But with a heart full of unstained love:
470	Welcome before the gates of Angiers, duke.
471	
472	LEWIS	A noble boy! Who would not do thee right?
473	
474	AUSTRIA	Upon thy cheek lay I this zealous kiss,
475	As seal to this indenture of my love,
476	That to my home I will no more return,
477	Till Angiers and the right thou hast in France,
478	Together with that pale, that white-faced shore,
479	Whose foot spurns back the ocean's roaring tides
480	And coops from other lands her islanders,
481	Even till that England, hedged in with the main,
482	That water-walled bulwark, still secure
483	And confident from foreign purposes,
484	Even till that utmost corner of the west
485	Salute thee for her king: till then, fair boy,
486	Will I not think of home, but follow arms.
487	
488	CONSTANCE	O, take his mother's thanks, a widow's thanks,
489	Till your strong hand shall help to give him strength
490	To make a more requital to your love!
491	
492	AUSTRIA	The peace of heaven is theirs that lift their swords
493	In such a just and charitable war.
494	
495	KING PHILIP	Well then, to work: our cannon shall be bent
496	Against the brows of this resisting town.
497	Call for our chiefest men of discipline,
498	To cull the plots of best advantages:
499	We'll lay before this town our royal bones,
500	Wade to the market-place in Frenchmen's blood,
501	But we will make it subject to this boy.
502	
503	CONSTANCE	Stay for an answer to your embassy,
504	Lest unadvised you stain your swords with blood:
505	My Lord Chatillon may from England bring,
506	That right in peace which here we urge in war,
507	And then we shall repent each drop of blood
508	That hot rash haste so indirectly shed.
509	
510	[Enter CHATILLON]
511	
512	KING PHILIP	A wonder, lady! lo, upon thy wish,
513	Our messenger Chatillon is arrived!
514	What England says, say briefly, gentle lord;
515	We coldly pause for thee; Chatillon, speak.
516	
517	CHATILLON	Then turn your forces from this paltry siege
518	And stir them up against a mightier task.
519	England, impatient of your just demands,
520	Hath put himself in arms: the adverse winds,
521	Whose leisure I have stay'd, have given him time
522	To land his legions all as soon as I;
523	His marches are expedient to this town,
524	His forces strong, his soldiers confident.
525	With him along is come the mother-queen,
526	An Ate, stirring him to blood and strife;
527	With her her niece, the Lady Blanch of Spain;
528	With them a bastard of the king's deceased,
529	And all the unsettled humours of the land,
530	Rash, inconsiderate, fiery voluntaries,
531	With ladies' faces and fierce dragons' spleens,
532	Have sold their fortunes at their native homes,
533	Bearing their birthrights proudly on their backs,
534	To make hazard of new fortunes here:
535	In brief, a braver choice of dauntless spirits
536	Than now the English bottoms have waft o'er
537	Did nearer float upon the swelling tide,
538	To do offence and scath in Christendom.
539	
540	[Drum beats]
541	
542	The interruption of their churlish drums
543	Cuts off more circumstance: they are at hand,
544	To parley or to fight; therefore prepare.
545	
546	KING PHILIP	How much unlook'd for is this expedition!
547	
548	AUSTRIA	By how much unexpected, by so much
549	We must awake endavour for defence;
550	For courage mounteth with occasion:
551	Let them be welcome then: we are prepared.
552	
553	[Enter KING JOHN, QUEEN ELINOR, BLANCH, the BASTARD,
554	Lords, and forces]
555	
556	KING JOHN	Peace be to France, if France in peace permit
557	Our just and lineal entrance to our own;
558	If not, bleed France, and peace ascend to heaven,
559	Whiles we, God's wrathful agent, do correct
560	Their proud contempt that beats His peace to heaven.
561	
562	KING PHILIP	Peace be to England, if that war return
563	From France to England, there to live in peace.
564	England we love; and for that England's sake
565	With burden of our armour here we sweat.
566	This toil of ours should be a work of thine;
567	But thou from loving England art so far,
568	That thou hast under-wrought his lawful king
569	Cut off the sequence of posterity,
570	Out-faced infant state and done a rape
571	Upon the maiden virtue of the crown.
572	Look here upon thy brother Geffrey's face;
573	These eyes, these brows, were moulded out of his:
574	This little abstract doth contain that large
575	Which died in Geffrey, and the hand of time
576	Shall draw this brief into as huge a volume.
577	That Geffrey was thy elder brother born,
578	And this his son; England was Geffrey's right
579	And this is Geffrey's: in the name of God
580	How comes it then that thou art call'd a king,
581	When living blood doth in these temples beat,
582	Which owe the crown that thou o'ermasterest?
583	
584	KING JOHN	From whom hast thou this great commission, France,
585	To draw my answer from thy articles?
586	
587	KING PHILIP	From that supernal judge, that stirs good thoughts
588	In any breast of strong authority,
589	To look into the blots and stains of right:
590	That judge hath made me guardian to this boy:
591	Under whose warrant I impeach thy wrong
592	And by whose help I mean to chastise it.
593	
594	KING JOHN	Alack, thou dost usurp authority.
595	
596	KING PHILIP	Excuse; it is to beat usurping down.
597	
598	QUEEN ELINOR	Who is it thou dost call usurper, France?
599	
600	CONSTANCE	Let me make answer; thy usurping son.
601	
602	QUEEN ELINOR	Out, insolent! thy bastard shall be king,
603	That thou mayst be a queen, and cheque the world!
604	
605	CONSTANCE	My bed was ever to thy son as true
606	As thine was to thy husband; and this boy
607	Liker in feature to his father Geffrey
608	Than thou and John in manners; being as like
609	As rain to water, or devil to his dam.
610	My boy a bastard! By my soul, I think
611	His father never was so true begot:
612	It cannot be, an if thou wert his mother.
613	
614	QUEEN ELINOR	There's a good mother, boy, that blots thy father.
615	
616	CONSTANCE	There's a good grandam, boy, that would blot thee.
617	
618	AUSTRIA	Peace!
619	
620	BASTARD	     Hear the crier.
621	
622	AUSTRIA	What the devil art thou?
623	
624	BASTARD	One that will play the devil, sir, with you,
625	An a' may catch your hide and you alone:
626	You are the hare of whom the proverb goes,
627	Whose valour plucks dead lions by the beard;
628	I'll smoke your skin-coat, an I catch you right;
629	Sirrah, look to't; i' faith, I will, i' faith.
630	
631	BLANCH	O, well did he become that lion's robe
632	That did disrobe the lion of that robe!
633	
634	BASTARD	It lies as sightly on the back of him
635	As great Alcides' shows upon an ass:
636	But, ass, I'll take that burthen from your back,
637	Or lay on that shall make your shoulders crack.
638	
639	AUSTRIA	What craker is this same that deafs our ears
640	With this abundance of superfluous breath?
641	
642	KING PHILIP	Lewis, determine what we shall do straight.
643	
644	LEWIS	Women and fools, break off your conference.
645	King John, this is the very sum of all;
646	England and Ireland, Anjou, Touraine, Maine,
647	In right of Arthur do I claim of thee:
648	Wilt thou resign them and lay down thy arms?
649	
650	KING JOHN	My life as soon: I do defy thee, France.
651	Arthur of Bretagne, yield thee to my hand;
652	And out of my dear love I'll give thee more
653	Than e'er the coward hand of France can win:
654	Submit thee, boy.
655	
656	QUEEN ELINOR	                  Come to thy grandam, child.
657	
658	CONSTANCE	Do, child, go to it grandam, child:
659	Give grandam kingdom, and it grandam will
660	Give it a plum, a cherry, and a fig:
661	There's a good grandam.
662	
663	ARTHUR	Good my mother, peace!
664	I would that I were low laid in my grave:
665	I am not worth this coil that's made for me.
666	
667	QUEEN ELINOR	His mother shames him so, poor boy, he weeps.
668	
669	CONSTANCE	Now shame upon you, whether she does or no!
670	His grandam's wrongs, and not his mother's shames,
671	Draws those heaven-moving pearls from his poor eyes,
672	Which heaven shall take in nature of a fee;
673	Ay, with these crystal beads heaven shall be bribed
674	To do him justice and revenge on you.
675	
676	QUEEN ELINOR	Thou monstrous slanderer of heaven and earth!
677	
678	CONSTANCE	Thou monstrous injurer of heaven and earth!
679	Call not me slanderer; thou and thine usurp
680	The dominations, royalties and rights
681	Of this oppressed boy: this is thy eld'st son's son,
682	Infortunate in nothing but in thee:
683	Thy sins are visited in this poor child;
684	The canon of the law is laid on him,
685	Being but the second generation
686	Removed from thy sin-conceiving womb.
687	
688	KING JOHN	Bedlam, have done.
689	
690	CONSTANCE	                  I have but this to say,
691	That he is not only plagued for her sin,
692	But God hath made her sin and her the plague
693	On this removed issue, plague for her
694	And with her plague; her sin his injury,
695	Her injury the beadle to her sin,
696	All punish'd in the person of this child,
697	And all for her; a plague upon her!
698	
699	QUEEN ELINOR	Thou unadvised scold, I can produce
700	A will that bars the title of thy son.
701	
702	CONSTANCE	Ay, who doubts that? a will! a wicked will:
703	A woman's will; a canker'd grandam's will!
704	
705	KING PHILIP	Peace, lady! pause, or be more temperate:
706	It ill beseems this presence to cry aim
707	To these ill-tuned repetitions.
708	Some trumpet summon hither to the walls
709	These men of Angiers: let us hear them speak
710	Whose title they admit, Arthur's or John's.
711	
712	[Trumpet sounds. Enter certain Citizens upon the walls]
713	
714	First Citizen	Who is it that hath warn'd us to the walls?
715	
716	KING PHILIP	'Tis France, for England.
717	
718	KING JOHN	England, for itself.
719	You men of Angiers, and my loving subjects--
720	
721	KING PHILIP	You loving men of Angiers, Arthur's subjects,
722	Our trumpet call'd you to this gentle parle--
723	
724	KING JOHN	For our advantage; therefore hear us first.
725	These flags of France, that are advanced here
726	Before the eye and prospect of your town,
727	Have hither march'd to your endamagement:
728	The cannons have their bowels full of wrath,
729	And ready mounted are they to spit forth
730	Their iron indignation 'gainst your walls:
731	All preparation for a bloody siege
732	All merciless proceeding by these French
733	Confronts your city's eyes, your winking gates;
734	And but for our approach those sleeping stones,
735	That as a waist doth girdle you about,
736	By the compulsion of their ordinance
737	By this time from their fixed beds of lime
738	Had been dishabited, and wide havoc made
739	For bloody power to rush upon your peace.
740	But on the sight of us your lawful king,
741	Who painfully with much expedient march
742	Have brought a countercheque before your gates,
743	To save unscratch'd your city's threatened cheeks,
744	Behold, the French amazed vouchsafe a parle;
745	And now, instead of bullets wrapp'd in fire,
746	To make a shaking fever in your walls,
747	They shoot but calm words folded up in smoke,
748	To make a faithless error in your ears:
749	Which trust accordingly, kind citizens,
750	And let us in, your king, whose labour'd spirits,
751	Forwearied in this action of swift speed,
752	Crave harbourage within your city walls.
753	
754	KING PHILIP	When I have said, make answer to us both.
755	Lo, in this right hand, whose protection
756	Is most divinely vow'd upon the right
757	Of him it holds, stands young Plantagenet,
758	Son to the elder brother of this man,
759	And king o'er him and all that he enjoys:
760	For this down-trodden equity, we tread
761	In warlike march these greens before your town,
762	Being no further enemy to you
763	Than the constraint of hospitable zeal
764	In the relief of this oppressed child
765	Religiously provokes. Be pleased then
766	To pay that duty which you truly owe
767	To that owes it, namely this young prince:
768	And then our arms, like to a muzzled bear,
769	Save in aspect, hath all offence seal'd up;
770	Our cannons' malice vainly shall be spent
771	Against the invulnerable clouds of heaven;
772	And with a blessed and unvex'd retire,
773	With unhack'd swords and helmets all unbruised,
774	We will bear home that lusty blood again
775	Which here we came to spout against your town,
776	And leave your children, wives and you in peace.
777	But if you fondly pass our proffer'd offer,
778	'Tis not the roundure of your old-faced walls
779	Can hide you from our messengers of war,
780	Though all these English and their discipline
781	Were harbour'd in their rude circumference.
782	Then tell us, shall your city call us lord,
783	In that behalf which we have challenged it?
784	Or shall we give the signal to our rage
785	And stalk in blood to our possession?
786	
787	First Citizen	In brief, we are the king of England's subjects:
788	For him, and in his right, we hold this town.
789	
790	KING JOHN	Acknowledge then the king, and let me in.
791	
792	First Citizen	That can we not; but he that proves the king,
793	To him will we prove loyal: till that time
794	Have we ramm'd up our gates against the world.
795	
796	KING JOHN	Doth not the crown of England prove the king?
797	And if not that, I bring you witnesses,
798	Twice fifteen thousand hearts of England's breed,--
799	
800	BASTARD	Bastards, and else.
801	
802	KING JOHN	To verify our title with their lives.
803	
804	KING PHILIP	As many and as well-born bloods as those,--
805	
806	BASTARD	Some bastards too.
807	
808	KING PHILIP	Stand in his face to contradict his claim.
809	
810	First Citizen	Till you compound whose right is worthiest,
811	We for the worthiest hold the right from both.
812	
813	KING JOHN	Then God forgive the sin of all those souls
814	That to their everlasting residence,
815	Before the dew of evening fall, shall fleet,
816	In dreadful trial of our kingdom's king!
817	
818	KING PHILIP	Amen, amen! Mount, chevaliers! to arms!
819	
820	BASTARD	Saint George, that swinged the dragon, and e'er since
821	Sits on his horseback at mine hostess' door,
822	Teach us some fence!
823	
824	[To AUSTRIA]
825	
826	Sirrah, were I at home,
827	At your den, sirrah, with your lioness
828	I would set an ox-head to your lion's hide,
829	And make a monster of you.
830	
831	AUSTRIA	Peace! no more.
832	
833	BASTARD	O tremble, for you hear the lion roar.
834	
835	KING JOHN	Up higher to the plain; where we'll set forth
836	In best appointment all our regiments.
837	
838	BASTARD	Speed then, to take advantage of the field.
839	
840	KING PHILIP	It shall be so; and at the other hill
841	Command the rest to stand. God and our right!
842	
843	[Exeunt]
844	
845	[Here after excursions, enter the Herald of France,
846	with trumpets, to the gates]
847	
848	French Herald	You men of Angiers, open wide your gates,
849	And let young Arthur, Duke of Bretagne, in,
850	Who by the hand of France this day hath made
851	Much work for tears in many an English mother,
852	Whose sons lie scattered on the bleeding ground;
853	Many a widow's husband grovelling lies,
854	Coldly embracing the discolour'd earth;
855	And victory, with little loss, doth play
856	Upon the dancing banners of the French,
857	Who are at hand, triumphantly display'd,
858	To enter conquerors and to proclaim
859	Arthur of Bretagne England's king and yours.
860	
861	[Enter English Herald, with trumpet]
862	
863	English Herald	Rejoice, you men of Angiers, ring your bells:
864	King John, your king and England's doth approach,
865	Commander of this hot malicious day:
866	Their armours, that march'd hence so silver-bright,
867	Hither return all gilt with Frenchmen's blood;
868	There stuck no plume in any English crest
869	That is removed by a staff of France;
870	Our colours do return in those same hands
871	That did display them when we first march'd forth;
872	And, like a troop of jolly huntsmen, come
873	Our lusty English, all with purpled hands,
874	Dyed in the dying slaughter of their foes:
875	Open your gates and gives the victors way.
876	
877	First Citizen	Heralds, from off our towers we might behold,
878	From first to last, the onset and retire
879	Of both your armies; whose equality
880	By our best eyes cannot be censured:
881	Blood hath bought blood and blows have answered blows;
882	Strength match'd with strength, and power confronted power:
883	Both are alike; and both alike we like.
884	One must prove greatest: while they weigh so even,
885	We hold our town for neither, yet for both.
886	
887	[Re-enter KING JOHN and KING PHILIP, with their
888	powers, severally]
889	
890	KING JOHN	France, hast thou yet more blood to cast away?
891	Say, shall the current of our right run on?
892	Whose passage, vex'd with thy impediment,
893	Shall leave his native channel and o'erswell
894	With course disturb'd even thy confining shores,
895	Unless thou let his silver water keep
896	A peaceful progress to the ocean.
897	
898	KING PHILIP	England, thou hast not saved one drop of blood,
899	In this hot trial, more than we of France;
900	Rather, lost more. And by this hand I swear,
901	That sways the earth this climate overlooks,
902	Before we will lay down our just-borne arms,
903	We'll put thee down, 'gainst whom these arms we bear,
904	Or add a royal number to the dead,
905	Gracing the scroll that tells of this war's loss
906	With slaughter coupled to the name of kings.
907	
908	BASTARD	Ha, majesty! how high thy glory towers,
909	When the rich blood of kings is set on fire!
910	O, now doth Death line his dead chaps with steel;
911	The swords of soldiers are his teeth, his fangs;
912	And now he feasts, mousing the flesh of men,
913	In undetermined differences of kings.
914	Why stand these royal fronts amazed thus?
915	Cry, 'havoc!' kings; back to the stained field,
916	You equal potents, fiery kindled spirits!
917	Then let confusion of one part confirm
918	The other's peace: till then, blows, blood and death!
919	
920	KING JOHN	Whose party do the townsmen yet admit?
921	
922	KING PHILIP	Speak, citizens, for England; who's your king?
923	
924	First Citizen	The king of England; when we know the king.
925	
926	KING PHILIP	Know him in us, that here hold up his right.
927	
928	KING JOHN	In us, that are our own great deputy
929	And bear possession of our person here,
930	Lord of our presence, Angiers, and of you.
931	
932	First Citizen	A greater power then we denies all this;
933	And till it be undoubted, we do lock
934	Our former scruple in our strong-barr'd gates;
935	King'd of our fears, until our fears, resolved,
936	Be by some certain king purged and deposed.
937	
938	BASTARD	By heaven, these scroyles of Angiers flout you, kings,
939	And stand securely on their battlements,
940	As in a theatre, whence they gape and point
941	At your industrious scenes and acts of death.
942	Your royal presences be ruled by me:
943	Do like the mutines of Jerusalem,
944	Be friends awhile and both conjointly bend
945	Your sharpest deeds of malice on this town:
946	By east and west let France and England mount
947	Their battering cannon charged to the mouths,
948	Till their soul-fearing clamours have brawl'd down
949	The flinty ribs of this contemptuous city:
950	I'ld play incessantly upon these jades,
951	Even till unfenced desolation
952	Leave them as naked as the vulgar air.
953	That done, dissever your united strengths,
954	And part your mingled colours once again;
955	Turn face to face and bloody point to point;
956	Then, in a moment, Fortune shall cull forth
957	Out of one side her happy minion,
958	To whom in favour she shall give the day,
959	And kiss him with a glorious victory.
960	How like you this wild counsel, mighty states?
961	Smacks it not something of the policy?
962	
963	KING JOHN	Now, by the sky that hangs above our heads,
964	I like it well. France, shall we knit our powers
965	And lay this Angiers even to the ground;
966	Then after fight who shall be king of it?
967	
968	BASTARD	An if thou hast the mettle of a king,
969	Being wronged as we are by this peevish town,
970	Turn thou the mouth of thy artillery,
971	As we will ours, against these saucy walls;
972	And when that we have dash'd them to the ground,
973	Why then defy each other and pell-mell
974	Make work upon ourselves, for heaven or hell.
975	
976	KING PHILIP	Let it be so. Say, where will you assault?
977	
978	KING JOHN	We from the west will send destruction
979	Into this city's bosom.
980	
981	AUSTRIA	I from the north.
982	
983	KING PHILIP	                  Our thunder from the south
984	Shall rain their drift of bullets on this town.
985	
986	BASTARD	O prudent discipline! From north to south:
987	Austria and France shoot in each other's mouth:
988	I'll stir them to it. Come, away, away!
989	
990	First Citizen	Hear us, great kings: vouchsafe awhile to stay,
991	And I shall show you peace and fair-faced league;
992	Win you this city without stroke or wound;
993	Rescue those breathing lives to die in beds,
994	That here come sacrifices for the field:
995	Persever not, but hear me, mighty kings.
996	
997	KING JOHN	Speak on with favour; we are bent to hear.
998	
999	First Citizen	That daughter there of Spain, the Lady Blanch,
1000	Is niece to England: look upon the years
1001	Of Lewis the Dauphin and that lovely maid:
1002	If lusty love should go in quest of beauty,
1003	Where should he find it fairer than in Blanch?
1004	If zealous love should go in search of virtue,
1005	Where should he find it purer than in Blanch?
1006	If love ambitious sought a match of birth,
1007	Whose veins bound richer blood than Lady Blanch?
1008	Such as she is, in beauty, virtue, birth,
1009	Is the young Dauphin every way complete:
1010	If not complete of, say he is not she;
1011	And she again wants nothing, to name want,
1012	If want it be not that she is not he:
1013	He is the half part of a blessed man,
1014	Left to be finished by such as she;
1015	And she a fair divided excellence,
1016	Whose fulness of perfection lies in him.
1017	O, two such silver currents, when they join,
1018	Do glorify the banks that bound them in;
1019	And two such shores to two such streams made one,
1020	Two such controlling bounds shall you be, kings,
1021	To these two princes, if you marry them.
1022	This union shall do more than battery can
1023	To our fast-closed gates; for at this match,
1024	With swifter spleen than powder can enforce,
1025	The mouth of passage shall we fling wide ope,
1026	And give you entrance: but without this match,
1027	The sea enraged is not half so deaf,
1028	Lions more confident, mountains and rocks
1029	More free from motion, no, not Death himself
1030	In moral fury half so peremptory,
1031	As we to keep this city.
1032	
1033	BASTARD	Here's a stay
1034	That shakes the rotten carcass of old Death
1035	Out of his rags! Here's a large mouth, indeed,
1036	That spits forth death and mountains, rocks and seas,
1037	Talks as familiarly of roaring lions
1038	As maids of thirteen do of puppy-dogs!
1039	What cannoneer begot this lusty blood?
1040	He speaks plain cannon fire, and smoke and bounce;
1041	He gives the bastinado with his tongue:
1042	Our ears are cudgell'd; not a word of his
1043	But buffets better than a fist of France:
1044	Zounds! I was never so bethump'd with words
1045	Since I first call'd my brother's father dad.
1046	
1047	QUEEN ELINOR	Son, list to this conjunction, make this match;
1048	Give with our niece a dowry large enough:
1049	For by this knot thou shalt so surely tie
1050	Thy now unsured assurance to the crown,
1051	That yon green boy shall have no sun to ripe
1052	The bloom that promiseth a mighty fruit.
1053	I see a yielding in the looks of France;
1054	Mark, how they whisper: urge them while their souls
1055	Are capable of this ambition,
1056	Lest zeal, now melted by the windy breath
1057	Of soft petitions, pity and remorse,
1058	Cool and congeal again to what it was.
1059	
1060	First Citizen	Why answer not the double majesties
1061	This friendly treaty of our threaten'd town?
1062	
1063	KING PHILIP	Speak England first, that hath been forward first
1064	To speak unto this city: what say you?
1065	
1066	KING JOHN	If that the Dauphin there, thy princely son,
1067	Can in this book of beauty read 'I love,'
1068	Her dowry shall weigh equal with a queen:
1069	For Anjou and fair Touraine, Maine, Poictiers,
1070	And all that we upon this side the sea,
1071	Except this city now by us besieged,
1072	Find liable to our crown and dignity,
1073	Shall gild her bridal bed and make her rich
1074	In titles, honours and promotions,
1075	As she in beauty, education, blood,
1076	Holds hand with any princess of the world.
1077	
1078	KING PHILIP	What say'st thou, boy? look in the lady's face.
1079	
1080	LEWIS	I do, my lord; and in her eye I find
1081	A wonder, or a wondrous miracle,
1082	The shadow of myself form'd in her eye:
1083	Which being but the shadow of your son,
1084	Becomes a sun and makes your son a shadow:
1085	I do protest I never loved myself
1086	Till now infixed I beheld myself
1087	Drawn in the flattering table of her eye.
1088	
1089	[Whispers with BLANCH]
1090	
1091	BASTARD	Drawn in the flattering table of her eye!
1092	Hang'd in the frowning wrinkle of her brow!
1093	And quarter'd in her heart! he doth espy
1094	Himself love's traitor: this is pity now,
1095	That hang'd and drawn and quartered, there should be
1096	In such a love so vile a lout as he.
1097	
1098	BLANCH	My uncle's will in this respect is mine:
1099	If he see aught in you that makes him like,
1100	That any thing he sees, which moves his liking,
1101	I can with ease translate it to my will;
1102	Or if you will, to speak more properly,
1103	I will enforce it easily to my love.
1104	Further I will not flatter you, my lord,
1105	That all I see in you is worthy love,
1106	Than this; that nothing do I see in you,
1107	Though churlish thoughts themselves should be your judge,
1108	That I can find should merit any hate.
1109	
1110	KING JOHN	What say these young ones? What say you my niece?
1111	
1112	BLANCH	That she is bound in honour still to do
1113	What you in wisdom still vouchsafe to say.
1114	
1115	KING JOHN	Speak then, prince Dauphin; can you love this lady?
1116	
1117	LEWIS	Nay, ask me if I can refrain from love;
1118	For I do love her most unfeignedly.
1119	
1120	KING JOHN	Then do I give Volquessen, Touraine, Maine,
1121	Poictiers and Anjou, these five provinces,
1122	With her to thee; and this addition more,
1123	Full thirty thousand marks of English coin.
1124	Philip of France, if thou be pleased withal,
1125	Command thy son and daughter to join hands.
1126	
1127	KING PHILIP	It likes us well; young princes, close your hands.
1128	
1129	AUSTRIA	And your lips too; for I am well assured
1130	That I did so when I was first assured.
1131	
1132	KING PHILIP	Now, citizens of Angiers, ope your gates,
1133	Let in that amity which you have made;
1134	For at Saint Mary's chapel presently
1135	The rites of marriage shall be solemnized.
1136	Is not the Lady Constance in this troop?
1137	I know she is not, for this match made up
1138	Her presence would have interrupted much:
1139	Where is she and her son? tell me, who knows.
1140	
1141	LEWIS	She is sad and passionate at your highness' tent.
1142	
1143	KING PHILIP	And, by my faith, this league that we have made
1144	Will give her sadness very little cure.
1145	Brother of England, how may we content
1146	This widow lady? In her right we came;
1147	Which we, God knows, have turn'd another way,
1148	To our own vantage.
1149	
1150	KING JOHN	We will heal up all;
1151	For we'll create young Arthur Duke of Bretagne
1152	And Earl of Richmond; and this rich fair town
1153	We make him lord of. Call the Lady Constance;
1154	Some speedy messenger bid her repair
1155	To our solemnity: I trust we shall,
1156	If not fill up the measure of her will,
1157	Yet in some measure satisfy her so
1158	That we shall stop her exclamation.
1159	Go we, as well as haste will suffer us,
1160	To this unlook'd for, unprepared pomp.
1161	
1162	[Exeunt all but the BASTARD]
1163	
1164	BASTARD	Mad world! mad kings! mad composition!
1165	John, to stop Arthur's title in the whole,
1166	Hath willingly departed with a part,
1167	And France, whose armour conscience buckled on,
1168	Whom zeal and charity brought to the field
1169	As God's own soldier, rounded in the ear
1170	With that same purpose-changer, that sly devil,
1171	That broker, that still breaks the pate of faith,
1172	That daily break-vow, he that wins of all,
1173	Of kings, of beggars, old men, young men, maids,
1174	Who, having no external thing to lose
1175	But the word 'maid,' cheats the poor maid of that,
1176	That smooth-faced gentleman, tickling Commodity,
1177	Commodity, the bias of the world,
1178	The world, who of itself is peised well,
1179	Made to run even upon even ground,
1180	Till this advantage, this vile-drawing bias,
1181	This sway of motion, this Commodity,
1182	Makes it take head from all indifferency,
1183	From all direction, purpose, course, intent:
1184	And this same bias, this Commodity,
1185	This bawd, this broker, this all-changing word,
1186	Clapp'd on the outward eye of fickle France,
1187	Hath drawn him from his own determined aid,
1188	From a resolved and honourable war,
1189	To a most base and vile-concluded peace.
1190	And why rail I on this Commodity?
1191	But for because he hath not woo'd me yet:
1192	Not that I have the power to clutch my hand,
1193	When his fair angels would salute my palm;
1194	But for my hand, as unattempted yet,
1195	Like a poor beggar, raileth on the rich.
1196	Well, whiles I am a beggar, I will rail
1197	And say there is no sin but to be rich;
1198	And being rich, my virtue then shall be
1199	To say there is no vice but beggary.
1200	Since kings break faith upon commodity,
1201	Gain, be my lord, for I will worship thee.

1211	ACT III
1212	
1213	
1214	
1215	SCENE I	The French King's pavilion.
1216	
1217	
1218	[Enter CONSTANCE, ARTHUR, and SALISBURY]
1219	
1220	CONSTANCE	Gone to be married! gone to swear a peace!
1221	False blood to false blood join'd! gone to be friends!
1222	Shall Lewis have Blanch, and Blanch those provinces?
1223	It is not so; thou hast misspoke, misheard:
1224	Be well advised, tell o'er thy tale again:
1225	It cannot be; thou dost but say 'tis so:
1226	I trust I may not trust thee; for thy word
1227	Is but the vain breath of a common man:
1228	Believe me, I do not believe thee, man;
1229	I have a king's oath to the contrary.
1230	Thou shalt be punish'd for thus frighting me,
1231	For I am sick and capable of fears,
1232	Oppress'd with wrongs and therefore full of fears,
1233	A widow, husbandless, subject to fears,
1234	A woman, naturally born to fears;
1235	And though thou now confess thou didst but jest,
1236	With my vex'd spirits I cannot take a truce,
1237	But they will quake and tremble all this day.
1238	What dost thou mean by shaking of thy head?
1239	Why dost thou look so sadly on my son?
1240	What means that hand upon that breast of thine?
1241	Why holds thine eye that lamentable rheum,
1242	Like a proud river peering o'er his bounds?
1243	Be these sad signs confirmers of thy words?
1244	Then speak again; not all thy former tale,
1245	But this one word, whether thy tale be true.
1246	
1247	SALISBURY	As true as I believe you think them false
1248	That give you cause to prove my saying true.
1249	
1250	CONSTANCE	O, if thou teach me to believe this sorrow,
1251	Teach thou this sorrow how to make me die,
1252	And let belief and life encounter so
1253	As doth the fury of two desperate men
1254	Which in the very meeting fall and die.
1255	Lewis marry Blanch! O boy, then where art thou?
1256	France friend with England, what becomes of me?
1257	Fellow, be gone: I cannot brook thy sight:
1258	This news hath made thee a most ugly man.
1259	
1260	SALISBURY	What other harm have I, good lady, done,
1261	But spoke the harm that is by others done?
1262	
1263	CONSTANCE	Which harm within itself so heinous is
1264	As it makes harmful all that speak of it.
1265	
1266	ARTHUR	I do beseech you, madam, be content.
1267	
1268	CONSTANCE	If thou, that bid'st me be content, wert grim,
1269	Ugly and slanderous to thy mother's womb,
1270	Full of unpleasing blots and sightless stains,
1271	Lame, foolish, crooked, swart, prodigious,
1272	Patch'd with foul moles and eye-offending marks,
1273	I would not care, I then would be content,
1274	For then I should not love thee, no, nor thou
1275	Become thy great birth nor deserve a crown.
1276	But thou art fair, and at thy birth, dear boy,
1277	Nature and Fortune join'd to make thee great:
1278	Of Nature's gifts thou mayst with lilies boast,
1279	And with the half-blown rose. But Fortune, O,
1280	She is corrupted, changed and won from thee;
1281	She adulterates hourly with thine uncle John,
1282	And with her golden hand hath pluck'd on France
1283	To tread down fair respect of sovereignty,
1284	And made his majesty the bawd to theirs.
1285	France is a bawd to Fortune and King John,
1286	That strumpet Fortune, that usurping John!
1287	Tell me, thou fellow, is not France forsworn?
1288	Envenom him with words, or get thee gone
1289	And leave those woes alone which I alone
1290	Am bound to under-bear.
1291	
1292	SALISBURY	Pardon me, madam,
1293	I may not go without you to the kings.
1294	
1295	CONSTANCE	Thou mayst, thou shalt; I will not go with thee:
1296	I will instruct my sorrows to be proud;
1297	For grief is proud and makes his owner stoop.
1298	To me and to the state of my great grief
1299	Let kings assemble; for my grief's so great
1300	That no supporter but the huge firm earth
1301	Can hold it up: here I and sorrows sit;
1302	Here is my throne, bid kings come bow to it.
1303	
1304	[Seats herself on the ground]
1305	
1306	[Enter KING JOHN, KING PHILLIP, LEWIS, BLANCH,
1307	QUEEN ELINOR, the BASTARD, AUSTRIA, and Attendants]
1308	
1309	KING PHILIP	'Tis true, fair daughter; and this blessed day
1310	Ever in France shall be kept festival:
1311	To solemnize this day the glorious sun
1312	Stays in his course and plays the alchemist,
1313	Turning with splendor of his precious eye
1314	The meagre cloddy earth to glittering gold:
1315	The yearly course that brings this day about
1316	Shall never see it but a holiday.
1317	
1318	CONSTANCE	A wicked day, and not a holy day!
1319	
1320	[Rising]
1321	
1322	What hath this day deserved? what hath it done,
1323	That it in golden letters should be set
1324	Among the high tides in the calendar?
1325	Nay, rather turn this day out of the week,
1326	This day of shame, oppression, perjury.
1327	Or, if it must stand still, let wives with child
1328	Pray that their burthens may not fall this day,
1329	Lest that their hopes prodigiously be cross'd:
1330	But on this day let seamen fear no wreck;
1331	No bargains break that are not this day made:
1332	This day, all things begun come to ill end,
1333	Yea, faith itself to hollow falsehood change!
1334	
1335	KING PHILIP	By heaven, lady, you shall have no cause
1336	To curse the fair proceedings of this day:
1337	Have I not pawn'd to you my majesty?
1338	
1339	CONSTANCE	You have beguiled me with a counterfeit
1340	Resembling majesty, which, being touch'd and tried,
1341	Proves valueless: you are forsworn, forsworn;
1342	You came in arms to spill mine enemies' blood,
1343	But now in arms you strengthen it with yours:
1344	The grappling vigour and rough frown of war
1345	Is cold in amity and painted peace,
1346	And our oppression hath made up this league.
1347	Arm, arm, you heavens, against these perjured kings!
1348	A widow cries; be husband to me, heavens!
1349	Let not the hours of this ungodly day
1350	Wear out the day in peace; but, ere sunset,
1351	Set armed discord 'twixt these perjured kings!
1352	Hear me, O, hear me!
1353	
1354	AUSTRIA	Lady Constance, peace!
1355	
1356	CONSTANCE	War! war! no peace! peace is to me a war
1357	O Lymoges! O Austria! thou dost shame
1358	That bloody spoil: thou slave, thou wretch, thou coward!
1359	Thou little valiant, great in villany!
1360	Thou ever strong upon the stronger side!
1361	Thou Fortune's champion that dost never fight
1362	But when her humorous ladyship is by
1363	To teach thee safety! thou art perjured too,
1364	And soothest up greatness. What a fool art thou,
1365	A ramping fool, to brag and stamp and swear
1366	Upon my party! Thou cold-blooded slave,
1367	Hast thou not spoke like thunder on my side,
1368	Been sworn my soldier, bidding me depend
1369	Upon thy stars, thy fortune and thy strength,
1370	And dost thou now fall over to my fores?
1371	Thou wear a lion's hide! doff it for shame,
1372	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
1373	
1374	AUSTRIA	O, that a man should speak those words to me!
1375	
1376	BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
1377	
1378	AUSTRIA	Thou darest not say so, villain, for thy life.
1379	
1380	BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on those recreant limbs.
1381	
1382	KING JOHN	We like not this; thou dost forget thyself.
1383	
1384	[Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH]
1385	
1386	KING PHILIP	Here comes the holy legate of the pope.
1387	
1388	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Hail, you anointed deputies of heaven!
1389	To thee, King John, my holy errand is.
1390	I Pandulph, of fair Milan cardinal,
1391	And from Pope Innocent the legate here,
1392	Do in his name religiously demand
1393	Why thou against the church, our holy mother,
1394	So wilfully dost spurn; and force perforce
1395	Keep Stephen Langton, chosen archbishop
1396	Of Canterbury, from that holy see?
1397	This, in our foresaid holy father's name,
1398	Pope Innocent, I do demand of thee.
1399	
1400	KING JOHN	What earthy name to interrogatories
1401	Can task the free breath of a sacred king?
1402	Thou canst not, cardinal, devise a name
1403	So slight, unworthy and ridiculous,
1404	To charge me to an answer, as the pope.
1405	Tell him this tale; and from the mouth of England
1406	Add thus much more, that no Italian priest
1407	Shall tithe or toll in our dominions;
1408	But as we, under heaven, are supreme head,
1409	So under Him that great supremacy,
1410	Where we do reign, we will alone uphold,
1411	Without the assistance of a mortal hand:
1412	So tell the pope, all reverence set apart
1413	To him and his usurp'd authority.
1414	
1415	KING PHILIP	Brother of England, you blaspheme in this.
1416	
1417	KING JOHN	Though you and all the kings of Christendom
1418	Are led so grossly by this meddling priest,
1419	Dreading the curse that money may buy out;
1420	And by the merit of vile gold, dross, dust,
1421	Purchase corrupted pardon of a man,
1422	Who in that sale sells pardon from himself,
1423	Though you and all the rest so grossly led
1424	This juggling witchcraft with revenue cherish,
1425	Yet I alone, alone do me oppose
1426	Against the pope and count his friends my foes.
1427	
1428	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Then, by the lawful power that I have,
1429	Thou shalt stand cursed and excommunicate.
1430	And blessed shall he be that doth revolt
1431	From his allegiance to an heretic;
1432	And meritorious shall that hand be call'd,
1433	Canonized and worshipped as a saint,
1434	That takes away by any secret course
1435	Thy hateful life.
1436	
1437	CONSTANCE	                  O, lawful let it be
1438	That I have room with Rome to curse awhile!
1439	Good father cardinal, cry thou amen
1440	To my keen curses; for without my wrong
1441	There is no tongue hath power to curse him right.
1442	
1443	CARDINAL PANDULPH	There's law and warrant, lady, for my curse.
1444	
1445	CONSTANCE	And for mine too: when law can do no right,
1446	Let it be lawful that law bar no wrong:
1447	Law cannot give my child his kingdom here,
1448	For he that holds his kingdom holds the law;
1449	Therefore, since law itself is perfect wrong,
1450	How can the law forbid my tongue to curse?
1451	
1452	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Philip of France, on peril of a curse,
1453	Let go the hand of that arch-heretic;
1454	And raise the power of France upon his head,
1455	Unless he do submit himself to Rome.
1456	
1457	QUEEN ELINOR	Look'st thou pale, France? do not let go thy hand.
1458	
1459	CONSTANCE	Look to that, devil; lest that France repent,
1460	And by disjoining hands, hell lose a soul.
1461	
1462	AUSTRIA	King Philip, listen to the cardinal.
1463	
1464	BASTARD	And hang a calf's-skin on his recreant limbs.
1465	
1466	AUSTRIA	Well, ruffian, I must pocket up these wrongs, Because--
1467	
1468	BASTARD	        Your breeches best may carry them.
1469	
1470	KING JOHN	Philip, what say'st thou to the cardinal?
1471	
1472	CONSTANCE	What should he say, but as the cardinal?
1473	
1474	LEWIS	Bethink you, father; for the difference
1475	Is purchase of a heavy curse from Rome,
1476	Or the light loss of England for a friend:
1477	Forego the easier.
1478	
1479	BLANCH	                  That's the curse of Rome.
1480	
1481	CONSTANCE	O Lewis, stand fast! the devil tempts thee here
1482	In likeness of a new untrimmed bride.
1483	
1484	BLANCH	The Lady Constance speaks not from her faith,
1485	But from her need.
1486	
1487	CONSTANCE	                  O, if thou grant my need,
1488	Which only lives but by the death of faith,
1489	That need must needs infer this principle,
1490	That faith would live again by death of need.
1491	O then, tread down my need, and faith mounts up;
1492	Keep my need up, and faith is trodden down!
1493	
1494	KING JOHN	The king is moved, and answers not to this.
1495	
1496	CONSTANCE	O, be removed from him, and answer well!
1497	
1498	AUSTRIA	Do so, King Philip; hang no more in doubt.
1499	
1500	BASTARD	Hang nothing but a calf's-skin, most sweet lout.
1501	
1502	KING PHILIP	I am perplex'd, and know not what to say.
1503	
1504	CARDINAL PANDULPH	What canst thou say but will perplex thee more,
1505	If thou stand excommunicate and cursed?
1506	
1507	KING PHILIP	Good reverend father, make my person yours,
1508	And tell me how you would bestow yourself.
1509	This royal hand and mine are newly knit,
1510	And the conjunction of our inward souls
1511	Married in league, coupled and linked together
1512	With all religious strength of sacred vows;
1513	The latest breath that gave the sound of words
1514	Was deep-sworn faith, peace, amity, true love
1515	Between our kingdoms and our royal selves,
1516	And even before this truce, but new before,
1517	No longer than we well could wash our hands
1518	To clap this royal bargain up of peace,
1519	Heaven knows, they were besmear'd and over-stain'd
1520	With slaughter's pencil, where revenge did paint
1521	The fearful difference of incensed kings:
1522	And shall these hands, so lately purged of blood,
1523	So newly join'd in love, so strong in both,
1524	Unyoke this seizure and this kind regreet?
1525	Play fast and loose with faith? so jest with heaven,
1526	Make such unconstant children of ourselves,
1527	As now again to snatch our palm from palm,
1528	Unswear faith sworn, and on the marriage-bed
1529	Of smiling peace to march a bloody host,
1530	And make a riot on the gentle brow
1531	Of true sincerity? O, holy sir,
1532	My reverend father, let it not be so!
1533	Out of your grace, devise, ordain, impose
1534	Some gentle order; and then we shall be blest
1535	To do your pleasure and continue friends.
1536	
1537	CARDINAL PANDULPH	All form is formless, order orderless,
1538	Save what is opposite to England's love.
1539	Therefore to arms! be champion of our church,
1540	Or let the church, our mother, breathe her curse,
1541	A mother's curse, on her revolting son.
1542	France, thou mayst hold a serpent by the tongue,
1543	A chafed lion by the mortal paw,
1544	A fasting tiger safer by the tooth,
1545	Than keep in peace that hand which thou dost hold.
1546	
1547	KING PHILIP	I may disjoin my hand, but not my faith.
1548	
1549	CARDINAL PANDULPH	So makest thou faith an enemy to faith;
1550	And like a civil war set'st oath to oath,
1551	Thy tongue against thy tongue. O, let thy vow
1552	First made to heaven, first be to heaven perform'd,
1553	That is, to be the champion of our church!
1554	What since thou sworest is sworn against thyself
1555	And may not be performed by thyself,
1556	For that which thou hast sworn to do amiss
1557	Is not amiss when it is truly done,
1558	And being not done, where doing tends to ill,
1559	The truth is then most done not doing it:
1560	The better act of purposes mistook
1561	Is to mistake again; though indirect,
1562	Yet indirection thereby grows direct,
1563	And falsehood falsehood cures, as fire cools fire
1564	Within the scorched veins of one new-burn'd.
1565	It is religion that doth make vows kept;
1566	But thou hast sworn against religion,
1567	By what thou swear'st against the thing thou swear'st,
1568	And makest an oath the surety for thy truth
1569	Against an oath: the truth thou art unsure
1570	To swear, swears only not to be forsworn;
1571	Else what a mockery should it be to swear!
1572	But thou dost swear only to be forsworn;
1573	And most forsworn, to keep what thou dost swear.
1574	Therefore thy later vows against thy first
1575	Is in thyself rebellion to thyself;
1576	And better conquest never canst thou make
1577	Than arm thy constant and thy nobler parts
1578	Against these giddy loose suggestions:
1579	Upon which better part our prayers come in,
1580	If thou vouchsafe them. But if not, then know
1581	The peril of our curses light on thee
1582	So heavy as thou shalt not shake them off,
1583	But in despair die under their black weight.
1584	
1585	AUSTRIA	Rebellion, flat rebellion!
1586	
1587	BASTARD	Will't not be?
1588	Will not a calfs-skin stop that mouth of thine?
1589	
1590	LEWIS	Father, to arms!
1591	
1592	BLANCH	                  Upon thy wedding-day?
1593	Against the blood that thou hast married?
1594	What, shall our feast be kept with slaughter'd men?
1595	Shall braying trumpets and loud churlish drums,
1596	Clamours of hell, be measures to our pomp?
1597	O husband, hear me! ay, alack, how new
1598	Is husband in my mouth! even for that name,
1599	Which till this time my tongue did ne'er pronounce,
1600	Upon my knee I beg, go not to arms
1601	Against mine uncle.
1602	
1603	CONSTANCE	O, upon my knee,
1604	Made hard with kneeling, I do pray to thee,
1605	Thou virtuous Dauphin, alter not the doom
1606	Forethought by heaven!
1607	
1608	BLANCH	Now shall I see thy love: what motive may
1609	Be stronger with thee than the name of wife?
1610	
1611	CONSTANCE	That which upholdeth him that thee upholds,
1612	His honour: O, thine honour, Lewis, thine honour!
1613	
1614	LEWIS	I muse your majesty doth seem so cold,
1615	When such profound respects do pull you on.
1616	
1617	CARDINAL PANDULPH	I will denounce a curse upon his head.
1618	
1619	KING PHILIP	Thou shalt not need. England, I will fall from thee.
1620	
1621	CONSTANCE	O fair return of banish'd majesty!
1622	
1623	QUEEN ELINOR	O foul revolt of French inconstancy!
1624	
1625	KING JOHN	France, thou shalt rue this hour within this hour.
1626	
1627	BASTARD	Old Time the clock-setter, that bald sexton Time,
1628	Is it as he will? well then, France shall rue.
1629	
1630	BLANCH	The sun's o'ercast with blood: fair day, adieu!
1631	Which is the side that I must go withal?
1632	I am with both: each army hath a hand;
1633	And in their rage, I having hold of both,
1634	They swirl asunder and dismember me.
1635	Husband, I cannot pray that thou mayst win;
1636	Uncle, I needs must pray that thou mayst lose;
1637	Father, I may not wish the fortune thine;
1638	Grandam, I will not wish thy fortunes thrive:
1639	Whoever wins, on that side shall I lose
1640	Assured loss before the match be play'd.
1641	
1642	LEWIS	Lady, with me, with me thy fortune lies.
1643	
1644	BLANCH	There where my fortune lives, there my life dies.
1645	
1646	KING JOHN	Cousin, go draw our puissance together.
1647	
1648	[Exit BASTARD]
1649	
1650	France, I am burn'd up with inflaming wrath;
1651	A rage whose heat hath this condition,
1652	That nothing can allay, nothing but blood,
1653	The blood, and dearest-valued blood, of France.
1654	
1655	KING PHILIP	Thy rage sham burn thee up, and thou shalt turn
1656	To ashes, ere our blood shall quench that fire:
1657	Look to thyself, thou art in jeopardy.
1658	
1659	KING JOHN	No more than he that threats. To arms let's hie!

1675	
1676	[Alarums, excursions. Enter the BASTARD, with
1677	AUSTRIA'S head]
1678	
1679	BASTARD	Now, by my life, this day grows wondrous hot;
1680	Some airy devil hovers in the sky
1681	And pours down mischief. Austria's head lie there,
1682	While Philip breathes.
1683	
1684	[Enter KING JOHN, ARTHUR, and HUBERT]
1685	
1686	KING JOHN	Hubert, keep this boy. Philip, make up:
1687	My mother is assailed in our tent,
1688	And ta'en, I fear.
1689	
1690	BASTARD	                  My lord, I rescued her;
1691	Her highness is in safety, fear you not:
1692	But on, my liege; for very little pains
1693	Will bring this labour to an happy end.

1709	
1710	[Alarums, excursions, retreat. Enter KING JOHN,
1711	QUEEN ELINOR, ARTHUR, the BASTARD, HUBERT,
1712	and Lords]
1713	
1714	KING JOHN	[To QUEEN ELINOR]  So shall it be; your grace shall
1715	stay behind
1716	So strongly guarded.
1717	
1718	[To ARTHUR]
1719	
1720	Cousin, look not sad:
1721	Thy grandam loves thee; and thy uncle will
1722	As dear be to thee as thy father was.
1723	
1724	ARTHUR	O, this will make my mother die with grief!
1725	
1726	KING JOHN	[To the BASTARD]  Cousin, away for England!
1727	haste before:
1728	And, ere our coming, see thou shake the bags
1729	Of hoarding abbots; imprisoned angels
1730	Set at liberty: the fat ribs of peace
1731	Must by the hungry now be fed upon:
1732	Use our commission in his utmost force.
1733	
1734	BASTARD	Bell, book, and candle shall not drive me back,
1735	When gold and silver becks me to come on.
1736	I leave your highness. Grandam, I will pray,
1737	If ever I remember to be holy,
1738	For your fair safety; so, I kiss your hand.
1739	
1740	ELINOR	Farewell, gentle cousin.
1741	
1742	KING JOHN	Coz, farewell.
1743	
1744	[Exit the BASTARD]
1745	
1746	QUEEN ELINOR	Come hither, little kinsman; hark, a word.
1747	
1748	KING JOHN	Come hither, Hubert. O my gentle Hubert,
1749	We owe thee much! within this wall of flesh
1750	There is a soul counts thee her creditor
1751	And with advantage means to pay thy love:
1752	And my good friend, thy voluntary oath
1753	Lives in this bosom, dearly cherished.
1754	Give me thy hand. I had a thing to say,
1755	But I will fit it with some better time.
1756	By heaven, Hubert, I am almost ashamed
1757	To say what good respect I have of thee.
1758	
1759	HUBERT	I am much bounden to your majesty.
1760	
1761	KING JOHN	Good friend, thou hast no cause to say so yet,
1762	But thou shalt have; and creep time ne'er so slow,
1763	Yet it shall come from me to do thee good.
1764	I had a thing to say, but let it go:
1765	The sun is in the heaven, and the proud day,
1766	Attended with the pleasures of the world,
1767	Is all too wanton and too full of gawds
1768	To give me audience: if the midnight bell
1769	Did, with his iron tongue and brazen mouth,
1770	Sound on into the drowsy race of night;
1771	If this same were a churchyard where we stand,
1772	And thou possessed with a thousand wrongs,
1773	Or if that surly spirit, melancholy,
1774	Had baked thy blood and made it heavy-thick,
1775	Which else runs tickling up and down the veins,
1776	Making that idiot, laughter, keep men's eyes
1777	And strain their cheeks to idle merriment,
1778	A passion hateful to my purposes,
1779	Or if that thou couldst see me without eyes,
1780	Hear me without thine ears, and make reply
1781	Without a tongue, using conceit alone,
1782	Without eyes, ears and harmful sound of words;
1783	Then, in despite of brooded watchful day,
1784	I would into thy bosom pour my thoughts:
1785	But, ah, I will not! yet I love thee well;
1786	And, by my troth, I think thou lovest me well.
1787	
1788	HUBERT	So well, that what you bid me undertake,
1789	Though that my death were adjunct to my act,
1790	By heaven, I would do it.
1791	
1792	KING JOHN	Do not I know thou wouldst?
1793	Good Hubert, Hubert, Hubert, throw thine eye
1794	On yon young boy: I'll tell thee what, my friend,
1795	He is a very serpent in my way;
1796	And whereso'er this foot of mine doth tread,
1797	He lies before me: dost thou understand me?
1798	Thou art his keeper.
1799	
1800	HUBERT	And I'll keep him so,
1801	That he shall not offend your majesty.
1802	
1803	KING JOHN	Death.
1804	
1805	HUBERT	My lord?
1806	
1807	KING JOHN	       A grave.
1808	
1809	HUBERT	                  He shall not live.
1810	
1811	KING JOHN	Enough.
1812	I could be merry now. Hubert, I love thee;
1813	Well, I'll not say what I intend for thee:
1814	Remember. Madam, fare you well:
1815	I'll send those powers o'er to your majesty.
1816	
1817	ELINOR	My blessing go with thee!
1818	
1819	KING JOHN	For England, cousin, go:
1820	Hubert shall be your man, attend on you
1821	With all true duty. On toward Calais, ho!
1822

1831	ACT III
1832	
1833	
1834	
1835	SCENE IV	The same. KING PHILIP'S tent.
1836	
1837	
1838	[Enter KING PHILIP, LEWIS, CARDINAL PANDULPH,
1839	and Attendants]
1840	
1841	KING PHILIP	So, by a roaring tempest on the flood,
1842	A whole armado of convicted sail
1843	Is scatter'd and disjoin'd from fellowship.
1844	
1845	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Courage and comfort! all shall yet go well.
1846	
1847	KING PHILIP	What can go well, when we have run so ill?
1848	Are we not beaten? Is not Angiers lost?
1849	Arthur ta'en prisoner? divers dear friends slain?
1850	And bloody England into England gone,
1851	O'erbearing interruption, spite of France?
1852	
1853	LEWIS	What he hath won, that hath he fortified:
1854	So hot a speed with such advice disposed,
1855	Such temperate order in so fierce a cause,
1856	Doth want example: who hath read or heard
1857	Of any kindred action like to this?
1858	
1859	KING PHILIP	Well could I bear that England had this praise,
1860	So we could find some pattern of our shame.
1861	
1862	[Enter CONSTANCE]
1863	
1864	Look, who comes here! a grave unto a soul;
1865	Holding the eternal spirit against her will,
1866	In the vile prison of afflicted breath.
1867	I prithee, lady, go away with me.
1868	
1869	CONSTANCE	Lo, now I now see the issue of your peace.
1870	
1871	KING PHILIP	Patience, good lady! comfort, gentle Constance!
1872	
1873	CONSTANCE	No, I defy all counsel, all redress,
1874	But that which ends all counsel, true redress,
1875	Death, death; O amiable lovely death!
1876	Thou odouriferous stench! sound rottenness!
1877	Arise forth from the couch of lasting night,
1878	Thou hate and terror to prosperity,
1879	And I will kiss thy detestable bones
1880	And put my eyeballs in thy vaulty brows
1881	And ring these fingers with thy household worms
1882	And stop this gap of breath with fulsome dust
1883	And be a carrion monster like thyself:
1884	Come, grin on me, and I will think thou smilest
1885	And buss thee as thy wife. Misery's love,
1886	O, come to me!
1887	
1888	KING PHILIP	                  O fair affliction, peace!
1889	
1890	CONSTANCE	No, no, I will not, having breath to cry:
1891	O, that my tongue were in the thunder's mouth!
1892	Then with a passion would I shake the world;
1893	And rouse from sleep that fell anatomy
1894	Which cannot hear a lady's feeble voice,
1895	Which scorns a modern invocation.
1896	
1897	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Lady, you utter madness, and not sorrow.
1898	
1899	CONSTANCE	Thou art not holy to belie me so;
1900	I am not mad: this hair I tear is mine;
1901	My name is Constance; I was Geffrey's wife;
1902	Young Arthur is my son, and he is lost:
1903	I am not mad: I would to heaven I were!
1904	For then, 'tis like I should forget myself:
1905	O, if I could, what grief should I forget!
1906	Preach some philosophy to make me mad,
1907	And thou shalt be canonized, cardinal;
1908	For being not mad but sensible of grief,
1909	My reasonable part produces reason
1910	How I may be deliver'd of these woes,
1911	And teaches me to kill or hang myself:
1912	If I were mad, I should forget my son,
1913	Or madly think a babe of clouts were he:
1914	I am not mad; too well, too well I feel
1915	The different plague of each calamity.
1916	
1917	KING PHILIP	Bind up those tresses. O, what love I note
1918	In the fair multitude of those her hairs!
1919	Where but by chance a silver drop hath fallen,
1920	Even to that drop ten thousand wiry friends
1921	Do glue themselves in sociable grief,
1922	Like true, inseparable, faithful loves,
1923	Sticking together in calamity.
1924	
1925	CONSTANCE	To England, if you will.
1926	
1927	KING PHILIP	Bind up your hairs.
1928	
1929	CONSTANCE	Yes, that I will; and wherefore will I do it?
1930	I tore them from their bonds and cried aloud
1931	'O that these hands could so redeem my son,
1932	As they have given these hairs their liberty!'
1933	But now I envy at their liberty,
1934	And will again commit them to their bonds,
1935	Because my poor child is a prisoner.
1936	And, father cardinal, I have heard you say
1937	That we shall see and know our friends in heaven:
1938	If that be true, I shall see my boy again;
1939	For since the birth of Cain, the first male child,
1940	To him that did but yesterday suspire,
1941	There was not such a gracious creature born.
1942	But now will canker-sorrow eat my bud
1943	And chase the native beauty from his cheek
1944	And he will look as hollow as a ghost,
1945	As dim and meagre as an ague's fit,
1946	And so he'll die; and, rising so again,
1947	When I shall meet him in the court of heaven
1948	I shall not know him: therefore never, never
1949	Must I behold my pretty Arthur more.
1950	
1951	CARDINAL PANDULPH	You hold too heinous a respect of grief.
1952	
1953	CONSTANCE	He talks to me that never had a son.
1954	
1955	KING PHILIP	You are as fond of grief as of your child.
1956	
1957	CONSTANCE	Grief fills the room up of my absent child,
1958	Lies in his bed, walks up and down with me,
1959	Puts on his pretty looks, repeats his words,
1960	Remembers me of all his gracious parts,
1961	Stuffs out his vacant garments with his form;
1962	Then, have I reason to be fond of grief?
1963	Fare you well: had you such a loss as I,
1964	I could give better comfort than you do.
1965	I will not keep this form upon my head,
1966	When there is such disorder in my wit.
1967	O Lord! my boy, my Arthur, my fair son!
1968	My life, my joy, my food, my all the world!
1969	My widow-comfort, and my sorrows' cure!
1970	
1971	[Exit]
1972	
1973	KING PHILIP	I fear some outrage, and I'll follow her.
1974	
1975	[Exit]
1976	
1977	LEWIS	There's nothing in this world can make me joy:
1978	Life is as tedious as a twice-told tale
1979	Vexing the dull ear of a drowsy man;
1980	And bitter shame hath spoil'd the sweet world's taste
1981	That it yields nought but shame and bitterness.
1982	
1983	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Before the curing of a strong disease,
1984	Even in the instant of repair and health,
1985	The fit is strongest; evils that take leave,
1986	On their departure most of all show evil:
1987	What have you lost by losing of this day?
1988	
1989	LEWIS	All days of glory, joy and happiness.
1990	
1991	CARDINAL PANDULPH	If you had won it, certainly you had.
1992	No, no; when Fortune means to men most good,
1993	She looks upon them with a threatening eye.
1994	'Tis strange to think how much King John hath lost
1995	In this which he accounts so clearly won:
1996	Are not you grieved that Arthur is his prisoner?
1997	
1998	LEWIS	As heartily as he is glad he hath him.
1999	
2000	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Your mind is all as youthful as your blood.
2001	Now hear me speak with a prophetic spirit;
2002	For even the breath of what I mean to speak
2003	Shall blow each dust, each straw, each little rub,
2004	Out of the path which shall directly lead
2005	Thy foot to England's throne; and therefore mark.
2006	John hath seized Arthur; and it cannot be
2007	That, whiles warm life plays in that infant's veins,
2008	The misplaced John should entertain an hour,
2009	One minute, nay, one quiet breath of rest.
2010	A sceptre snatch'd with an unruly hand
2011	Must be as boisterously maintain'd as gain'd;
2012	And he that stands upon a slippery place
2013	Makes nice of no vile hold to stay him up:
2014	That John may stand, then Arthur needs must fall;
2015	So be it, for it cannot be but so.
2016	
2017	LEWIS	But what shall I gain by young Arthur's fall?
2018	
2019	CARDINAL PANDULPH	You, in the right of Lady Blanch your wife,
2020	May then make all the claim that Arthur did.
2021	
2022	LEWIS	And lose it, life and all, as Arthur did.
2023	
2024	CARDINAL PANDULPH	How green you are and fresh in this old world!
2025	John lays you plots; the times conspire with you;
2026	For he that steeps his safety in true blood
2027	Shall find but bloody safety and untrue.
2028	This act so evilly born shall cool the hearts
2029	Of all his people and freeze up their zeal,
2030	That none so small advantage shall step forth
2031	To cheque his reign, but they will cherish it;
2032	No natural exhalation in the sky,
2033	No scope of nature, no distemper'd day,
2034	No common wind, no customed event,
2035	But they will pluck away his natural cause
2036	And call them meteors, prodigies and signs,
2037	Abortives, presages and tongues of heaven,
2038	Plainly denouncing vengeance upon John.
2039	
2040	LEWIS	May be he will not touch young Arthur's life,
2041	But hold himself safe in his prisonment.
2042	
2043	CARDINAL PANDULPH	O, sir, when he shall hear of your approach,
2044	If that young Arthur be not gone already,
2045	Even at that news he dies; and then the hearts
2046	Of all his people shall revolt from him
2047	And kiss the lips of unacquainted change
2048	And pick strong matter of revolt and wrath
2049	Out of the bloody fingers' ends of John.
2050	Methinks I see this hurly all on foot:
2051	And, O, what better matter breeds for you
2052	Than I have named! The bastard Faulconbridge
2053	Is now in England, ransacking the church,
2054	Offending charity: if but a dozen French
2055	Were there in arms, they would be as a call
2056	To train ten thousand English to their side,
2057	Or as a little snow, tumbled about,
2058	Anon becomes a mountain. O noble Dauphin,
2059	Go with me to the king: 'tis wonderful
2060	What may be wrought out of their discontent,
2061	Now that their souls are topful of offence.
2062	For England go: I will whet on the king.
2063	
2064	LEWIS	Strong reasons make strong actions: let us go:
2065	If you say ay, the king will not say no.
2066

2075	ACT IV
2076	
2077	
2078	
2079	SCENE I	A room in a castle.
2080	
2081	
2082	[Enter HUBERT and Executioners]
2083	
2084	HUBERT	Heat me these irons hot; and look thou stand
2085	Within the arras: when I strike my foot
2086	Upon the bosom of the ground, rush forth,
2087	And bind the boy which you shall find with me
2088	Fast to the chair: be heedful: hence, and watch.
2089	
2090	First Executioner	I hope your warrant will bear out the deed.
2091	
2092	HUBERT	Uncleanly scruples! fear not you: look to't.
2093	
2094	[Exeunt Executioners]
2095	
2096	Young lad, come forth; I have to say with you.
2097	
2098	[Enter ARTHUR]
2099	
2100	ARTHUR	Good morrow, Hubert.
2101	
2102	HUBERT	Good morrow, little prince.
2103	
2104	ARTHUR	As little prince, having so great a title
2105	To be more prince, as may be. You are sad.
2106	
2107	HUBERT	Indeed, I have been merrier.
2108	
2109	ARTHUR	Mercy on me!
2110	Methinks no body should be sad but I:
2111	Yet, I remember, when I was in France,
2112	Young gentlemen would be as sad as night,
2113	Only for wantonness. By my christendom,
2114	So I were out of prison and kept sheep,
2115	I should be as merry as the day is long;
2116	And so I would be here, but that I doubt
2117	My uncle practises more harm to me:
2118	He is afraid of me and I of him:
2119	Is it my fault that I was Geffrey's son?
2120	No, indeed, is't not; and I would to heaven
2121	I were your son, so you would love me, Hubert.
2122	
2123	HUBERT	[Aside]  If I talk to him, with his innocent prate
2124	He will awake my mercy which lies dead:
2125	Therefore I will be sudden and dispatch.
2126	
2127	ARTHUR	Are you sick, Hubert? you look pale to-day:
2128	In sooth, I would you were a little sick,
2129	That I might sit all night and watch with you:
2130	I warrant I love you more than you do me.
2131	
2132	HUBERT	[Aside]  His words do take possession of my bosom.
2133	Read here, young Arthur.
2134	
2135	[Showing a paper]
2136	
2137	[Aside]
2138	
2139	How now, foolish rheum!
2140	Turning dispiteous torture out of door!
2141	I must be brief, lest resolution drop
2142	Out at mine eyes in tender womanish tears.
2143	Can you not read it? Is it not fair writ?
2144	
2145	ARTHUR	Too fairly, Hubert, for so foul effect:
2146	Must you with hot irons burn out both mine eyes?
2147	
2148	HUBERT	Young boy, I must.
2149	
2150	ARTHUR	                  And will you?
2151	
2152	HUBERT	And I will.
2153	
2154	ARTHUR	Have you the heart? When your head did but ache,
2155	I knit my handercher about your brows,
2156	The best I had, a princess wrought it me,
2157	And I did never ask it you again;
2158	And with my hand at midnight held your head,
2159	And like the watchful minutes to the hour,
2160	Still and anon cheer'd up the heavy time,
2161	Saying, 'What lack you?' and 'Where lies your grief?'
2162	Or 'What good love may I perform for you?'
2163	Many a poor man's son would have lien still
2164	And ne'er have spoke a loving word to you;
2165	But you at your sick service had a prince.
2166	Nay, you may think my love was crafty love
2167	And call it cunning: do, an if you will:
2168	If heaven be pleased that you must use me ill,
2169	Why then you must. Will you put out mine eyes?
2170	These eyes that never did nor never shall
2171	So much as frown on you.
2172	
2173	HUBERT	I have sworn to do it;
2174	And with hot irons must I burn them out.
2175	
2176	ARTHUR	Ah, none but in this iron age would do it!
2177	The iron of itself, though heat red-hot,
2178	Approaching near these eyes, would drink my tears
2179	And quench his fiery indignation
2180	Even in the matter of mine innocence;
2181	Nay, after that, consume away in rust
2182	But for containing fire to harm mine eye.
2183	Are you more stubborn-hard than hammer'd iron?
2184	An if an angel should have come to me
2185	And told me Hubert should put out mine eyes,
2186	I would not have believed him,--no tongue but Hubert's.
2187	
2188	HUBERT	Come forth.
2189	
2190	[Stamps]
2191	
2192	[Re-enter Executioners, with a cord, irons, &c]
2193	
2194	Do as I bid you do.
2195	
2196	ARTHUR	O, save me, Hubert, save me! my eyes are out
2197	Even with the fierce looks of these bloody men.
2198	
2199	HUBERT	Give me the iron, I say, and bind him here.
2200	
2201	ARTHUR	Alas, what need you be so boisterous-rough?
2202	I will not struggle, I will stand stone-still.
2203	For heaven sake, Hubert, let me not be bound!
2204	Nay, hear me, Hubert, drive these men away,
2205	And I will sit as quiet as a lamb;
2206	I will not stir, nor wince, nor speak a word,
2207	Nor look upon the iron angerly:
2208	Thrust but these men away, and I'll forgive you,
2209	Whatever torment you do put me to.
2210	
2211	HUBERT	Go, stand within; let me alone with him.
2212	
2213	First Executioner	I am best pleased to be from such a deed.
2214	
2215	[Exeunt Executioners]
2216	
2217	ARTHUR	Alas, I then have chid away my friend!
2218	He hath a stern look, but a gentle heart:
2219	Let him come back, that his compassion may
2220	Give life to yours.
2221	
2222	HUBERT	Come, boy, prepare yourself.
2223	
2224	ARTHUR	Is there no remedy?
2225	
2226	HUBERT	None, but to lose your eyes.
2227	
2228	ARTHUR	O heaven, that there were but a mote in yours,
2229	A grain, a dust, a gnat, a wandering hair,
2230	Any annoyance in that precious sense!
2231	Then feeling what small things are boisterous there,
2232	Your vile intent must needs seem horrible.
2233	
2234	HUBERT	Is this your promise? go to, hold your tongue.
2235	
2236	ARTHUR	Hubert, the utterance of a brace of tongues
2237	Must needs want pleading for a pair of eyes:
2238	Let me not hold my tongue, let me not, Hubert;
2239	Or, Hubert, if you will, cut out my tongue,
2240	So I may keep mine eyes: O, spare mine eyes.
2241	Though to no use but still to look on you!
2242	Lo, by my truth, the instrument is cold
2243	And would not harm me.
2244	
2245	HUBERT	I can heat it, boy.
2246	
2247	ARTHUR	No, in good sooth: the fire is dead with grief,
2248	Being create for comfort, to be used
2249	In undeserved extremes: see else yourself;
2250	There is no malice in this burning coal;
2251	The breath of heaven has blown his spirit out
2252	And strew'd repentent ashes on his head.
2253	
2254	HUBERT	But with my breath I can revive it, boy.
2255	
2256	ARTHUR	An if you do, you will but make it blush
2257	And glow with shame of your proceedings, Hubert:
2258	Nay, it perchance will sparkle in your eyes;
2259	And like a dog that is compell'd to fight,
2260	Snatch at his master that doth tarre him on.
2261	All things that you should use to do me wrong
2262	Deny their office: only you do lack
2263	That mercy which fierce fire and iron extends,
2264	Creatures of note for mercy-lacking uses.
2265	
2266	HUBERT	Well, see to live; I will not touch thine eye
2267	For all the treasure that thine uncle owes:
2268	Yet am I sworn and I did purpose, boy,
2269	With this same very iron to burn them out.
2270	
2271	ARTHUR	O, now you look like Hubert! all this while
2272	You were disguised.
2273	
2274	HUBERT	Peace; no more. Adieu.
2275	Your uncle must not know but you are dead;
2276	I'll fill these dogged spies with false reports:
2277	And, pretty child, sleep doubtless and secure,
2278	That Hubert, for the wealth of all the world,
2279	Will not offend thee.
2280	
2281	ARTHUR	O heaven! I thank you, Hubert.
2282	
2283	HUBERT	Silence; no more: go closely in with me:
2284	Much danger do I undergo for thee.
2285	
2286	[Exeunt]

2291	KING JOHN
2292	
2293	
2294	ACT IV
2295	
2296	
2297	
2298	SCENE II	KING JOHN'S palace.
2299	
2300	
2301	[Enter KING JOHN, PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and other Lords]
2302	
2303	KING JOHN	Here once again we sit, once again crown'd,
2304	And looked upon, I hope, with cheerful eyes.
2305	
2306	PEMBROKE	This 'once again,' but that your highness pleased,
2307	Was once superfluous: you were crown'd before,
2308	And that high royalty was ne'er pluck'd off,
2309	The faiths of men ne'er stained with revolt;
2310	Fresh expectation troubled not the land
2311	With any long'd-for change or better state.
2312	
2313	SALISBURY	Therefore, to be possess'd with double pomp,
2314	To guard a title that was rich before,
2315	To gild refined gold, to paint the lily,
2316	To throw a perfume on the violet,
2317	To smooth the ice, or add another hue
2318	Unto the rainbow, or with taper-light
2319	To seek the beauteous eye of heaven to garnish,
2320	Is wasteful and ridiculous excess.
2321	
2322	PEMBROKE	But that your royal pleasure must be done,
2323	This act is as an ancient tale new told,
2324	And in the last repeating troublesome,
2325	Being urged at a time unseasonable.
2326	
2327	SALISBURY	In this the antique and well noted face
2328	Of plain old form is much disfigured;
2329	And, like a shifted wind unto a sail,
2330	It makes the course of thoughts to fetch about,
2331	Startles and frights consideration,
2332	Makes sound opinion sick and truth suspected,
2333	For putting on so new a fashion'd robe.
2334	
2335	PEMBROKE	When workmen strive to do better than well,
2336	They do confound their skill in covetousness;
2337	And oftentimes excusing of a fault
2338	Doth make the fault the worse by the excuse,
2339	As patches set upon a little breach
2340	Discredit more in hiding of the fault
2341	Than did the fault before it was so patch'd.
2342	
2343	SALISBURY	To this effect, before you were new crown'd,
2344	We breathed our counsel: but it pleased your highness
2345	To overbear it, and we are all well pleased,
2346	Since all and every part of what we would
2347	Doth make a stand at what your highness will.
2348	
2349	KING JOHN	Some reasons of this double coronation
2350	I have possess'd you with and think them strong;
2351	And more, more strong, then lesser is my fear,
2352	I shall indue you with: meantime but ask
2353	What you would have reform'd that is not well,
2354	And well shall you perceive how willingly
2355	I will both hear and grant you your requests.
2356	
2357	PEMBROKE	Then I, as one that am the tongue of these,
2358	To sound the purpose of all their hearts,
2359	Both for myself and them, but, chief of all,
2360	Your safety, for the which myself and them
2361	Bend their best studies, heartily request
2362	The enfranchisement of Arthur; whose restraint
2363	Doth move the murmuring lips of discontent
2364	To break into this dangerous argument,--
2365	If what in rest you have in right you hold,
2366	Why then your fears, which, as they say, attend
2367	The steps of wrong, should move you to mew up
2368	Your tender kinsman and to choke his days
2369	With barbarous ignorance and deny his youth
2370	The rich advantage of good exercise?
2371	That the time's enemies may not have this
2372	To grace occasions, let it be our suit
2373	That you have bid us ask his liberty;
2374	Which for our goods we do no further ask
2375	Than whereupon our weal, on you depending,
2376	Counts it your weal he have his liberty.
2377	
2378	[Enter HUBERT]
2379	
2380	KING JOHN	Let it be so: I do commit his youth
2381	To your direction. Hubert, what news with you?
2382	
2383	[Taking him apart]
2384	
2385	PEMBROKE	This is the man should do the bloody deed;
2386	He show'd his warrant to a friend of mine:
2387	The image of a wicked heinous fault
2388	Lives in his eye; that close aspect of his
2389	Does show the mood of a much troubled breast;
2390	And I do fearfully believe 'tis done,
2391	What we so fear'd he had a charge to do.
2392	
2393	SALISBURY	The colour of the king doth come and go
2394	Between his purpose and his conscience,
2395	Like heralds 'twixt two dreadful battles set:
2396	His passion is so ripe, it needs must break.
2397	
2398	PEMBROKE	And when it breaks, I fear will issue thence
2399	The foul corruption of a sweet child's death.
2400	
2401	KING JOHN	We cannot hold mortality's strong hand:
2402	Good lords, although my will to give is living,
2403	The suit which you demand is gone and dead:
2404	He tells us Arthur is deceased to-night.
2405	
2406	SALISBURY	Indeed we fear'd his sickness was past cure.
2407	
2408	PEMBROKE	Indeed we heard how near his death he was
2409	Before the child himself felt he was sick:
2410	This must be answer'd either here or hence.
2411	
2412	KING JOHN	Why do you bend such solemn brows on me?
2413	Think you I bear the shears of destiny?
2414	Have I commandment on the pulse of life?
2415	
2416	SALISBURY	It is apparent foul play; and 'tis shame
2417	That greatness should so grossly offer it:
2418	So thrive it in your game! and so, farewell.
2419	
2420	PEMBROKE	Stay yet, Lord Salisbury; I'll go with thee,
2421	And find the inheritance of this poor child,
2422	His little kingdom of a forced grave.
2423	That blood which owed the breadth of all this isle,
2424	Three foot of it doth hold: bad world the while!
2425	This must not be thus borne: this will break out
2426	To all our sorrows, and ere long I doubt.
2427	
2428	[Exeunt Lords]
2429	
2430	KING JOHN	They burn in indignation. I repent:
2431	There is no sure foundation set on blood,
2432	No certain life achieved by others' death.
2433	
2434	[Enter a Messenger]
2435	
2436	A fearful eye thou hast: where is that blood
2437	That I have seen inhabit in those cheeks?
2438	So foul a sky clears not without a storm:
2439	Pour down thy weather: how goes all in France?
2440	
2441	Messenger	From France to England. Never such a power
2442	For any foreign preparation
2443	Was levied in the body of a land.
2444	The copy of your speed is learn'd by them;
2445	For when you should be told they do prepare,
2446	The tidings come that they are all arrived.
2447	
2448	KING JOHN	O, where hath our intelligence been drunk?
2449	Where hath it slept? Where is my mother's care,
2450	That such an army could be drawn in France,
2451	And she not hear of it?
2452	
2453	Messenger	My liege, her ear
2454	Is stopp'd with dust; the first of April died
2455	Your noble mother: and, as I hear, my lord,
2456	The Lady Constance in a frenzy died
2457	Three days before: but this from rumour's tongue
2458	I idly heard; if true or false I know not.
2459	
2460	KING JOHN	Withhold thy speed, dreadful occasion!
2461	O, make a league with me, till I have pleased
2462	My discontented peers! What! mother dead!
2463	How wildly then walks my estate in France!
2464	Under whose conduct came those powers of France
2465	That thou for truth givest out are landed here?
2466	
2467	Messenger	Under the Dauphin.
2468	
2469	KING JOHN	                  Thou hast made me giddy
2470	With these ill tidings.
2471	
2472	[Enter the BASTARD and PETER of Pomfret]
2473	
2474	Now, what says the world
2475	To your proceedings? do not seek to stuff
2476	My head with more ill news, for it is full.
2477	
2478	BASTARD	But if you be afeard to hear the worst,
2479	Then let the worst unheard fall on your bead.
2480	
2481	KING JOHN	Bear with me cousin, for I was amazed
2482	Under the tide: but now I breathe again
2483	Aloft the flood, and can give audience
2484	To any tongue, speak it of what it will.
2485	
2486	BASTARD	How I have sped among the clergymen,
2487	The sums I have collected shall express.
2488	But as I travell'd hither through the land,
2489	I find the people strangely fantasied;
2490	Possess'd with rumours, full of idle dreams,
2491	Not knowing what they fear, but full of fear:
2492	And here a prophet, that I brought with me
2493	From forth the streets of Pomfret, whom I found
2494	With many hundreds treading on his heels;
2495	To whom he sung, in rude harsh-sounding rhymes,
2496	That, ere the next Ascension-day at noon,
2497	Your highness should deliver up your crown.
2498	
2499	KING JOHN	Thou idle dreamer, wherefore didst thou so?
2500	
2501	PETER	Foreknowing that the truth will fall out so.
2502	
2503	KING JOHN	Hubert, away with him; imprison him;
2504	And on that day at noon whereon he says
2505	I shall yield up my crown, let him be hang'd.
2506	Deliver him to safety; and return,
2507	For I must use thee.
2508	
2509	[Exeunt HUBERT with PETER]
2510	
2511	O my gentle cousin,
2512	Hear'st thou the news abroad, who are arrived?
2513	
2514	BASTARD	The French, my lord; men's mouths are full of it:
2515	Besides, I met Lord Bigot and Lord Salisbury,
2516	With eyes as red as new-enkindled fire,
2517	And others more, going to seek the grave
2518	Of Arthur, who they say is kill'd to-night
2519	On your suggestion.
2520	
2521	KING JOHN	Gentle kinsman, go,
2522	And thrust thyself into their companies:
2523	I have a way to win their loves again;
2524	Bring them before me.
2525	
2526	BASTARD	I will seek them out.
2527	
2528	KING JOHN	Nay, but make haste; the better foot before.
2529	O, let me have no subject enemies,
2530	When adverse foreigners affright my towns
2531	With dreadful pomp of stout invasion!
2532	Be Mercury, set feathers to thy heels,
2533	And fly like thought from them to me again.
2534	
2535	BASTARD	The spirit of the time shall teach me speed.
2536	
2537	[Exit]
2538	
2539	KING JOHN	Spoke like a sprightful noble gentleman.
2540	Go after him; for he perhaps shall need
2541	Some messenger betwixt me and the peers;
2542	And be thou he.
2543	
2544	Messenger	                  With all my heart, my liege.
2545	
2546	[Exit]
2547	
2548	KING JOHN	My mother dead!
2549	
2550	[Re-enter HUBERT]
2551	
2552	HUBERT	My lord, they say five moons were seen to-night;
2553	Four fixed, and the fifth did whirl about
2554	The other four in wondrous motion.
2555	
2556	KING JOHN	Five moons!
2557	
2558	HUBERT	Old men and beldams in the streets
2559	Do prophesy upon it dangerously:
2560	Young Arthur's death is common in their mouths:
2561	And when they talk of him, they shake their heads
2562	And whisper one another in the ear;
2563	And he that speaks doth gripe the hearer's wrist,
2564	Whilst he that hears makes fearful action,
2565	With wrinkled brows, with nods, with rolling eyes.
2566	I saw a smith stand with his hammer, thus,
2567	The whilst his iron did on the anvil cool,
2568	With open mouth swallowing a tailor's news;
2569	Who, with his shears and measure in his hand,
2570	Standing on slippers, which his nimble haste
2571	Had falsely thrust upon contrary feet,
2572	Told of a many thousand warlike French
2573	That were embattailed and rank'd in Kent:
2574	Another lean unwash'd artificer
2575	Cuts off his tale and talks of Arthur's death.
2576	
2577	KING JOHN	Why seek'st thou to possess me with these fears?
2578	Why urgest thou so oft young Arthur's death?
2579	Thy hand hath murder'd him: I had a mighty cause
2580	To wish him dead, but thou hadst none to kill him.
2581	
2582	HUBERT	No had, my lord! why, did you not provoke me?
2583	
2584	KING JOHN	It is the curse of kings to be attended
2585	By slaves that take their humours for a warrant
2586	To break within the bloody house of life,
2587	And on the winking of authority
2588	To understand a law, to know the meaning
2589	Of dangerous majesty, when perchance it frowns
2590	More upon humour than advised respect.
2591	
2592	HUBERT	Here is your hand and seal for what I did.
2593	
2594	KING JOHN	O, when the last account 'twixt heaven and earth
2595	Is to be made, then shall this hand and seal
2596	Witness against us to damnation!
2597	How oft the sight of means to do ill deeds
2598	Make deeds ill done! Hadst not thou been by,
2599	A fellow by the hand of nature mark'd,
2600	Quoted and sign'd to do a deed of shame,
2601	This murder had not come into my mind:
2602	But taking note of thy abhorr'd aspect,
2603	Finding thee fit for bloody villany,
2604	Apt, liable to be employ'd in danger,
2605	I faintly broke with thee of Arthur's death;
2606	And thou, to be endeared to a king,
2607	Made it no conscience to destroy a prince.
2608	
2609	HUBERT	My lord--
2610	
2611	KING JOHN	Hadst thou but shook thy head or made a pause
2612	When I spake darkly what I purposed,
2613	Or turn'd an eye of doubt upon my face,
2614	As bid me tell my tale in express words,
2615	Deep shame had struck me dumb, made me break off,
2616	And those thy fears might have wrought fears in me:
2617	But thou didst understand me by my signs
2618	And didst in signs again parley with sin;
2619	Yea, without stop, didst let thy heart consent,
2620	And consequently thy rude hand to act
2621	The deed, which both our tongues held vile to name.
2622	Out of my sight, and never see me more!
2623	My nobles leave me; and my state is braved,
2624	Even at my gates, with ranks of foreign powers:
2625	Nay, in the body of this fleshly land,
2626	This kingdom, this confine of blood and breath,
2627	Hostility and civil tumult reigns
2628	Between my conscience and my cousin's death.
2629	
2630	HUBERT	Arm you against your other enemies,
2631	I'll make a peace between your soul and you.
2632	Young Arthur is alive: this hand of mine
2633	Is yet a maiden and an innocent hand,
2634	Not painted with the crimson spots of blood.
2635	Within this bosom never enter'd yet
2636	The dreadful motion of a murderous thought;
2637	And you have slander'd nature in my form,
2638	Which, howsoever rude exteriorly,
2639	Is yet the cover of a fairer mind
2640	Than to be butcher of an innocent child.
2641	
2642	KING JOHN	Doth Arthur live? O, haste thee to the peers,
2643	Throw this report on their incensed rage,
2644	And make them tame to their obedience!
2645	Forgive the comment that my passion made
2646	Upon thy feature; for my rage was blind,
2647	And foul imaginary eyes of blood
2648	Presented thee more hideous than thou art.
2649	O, answer not, but to my closet bring
2650	The angry lords with all expedient haste.
2651	I conjure thee but slowly; run more fast.
2652	
2653	[Exeunt]

2661	ACT IV
2662	
2663	
2664	
2665	SCENE III	Before the castle.
2666	
2667	
2668	[Enter ARTHUR, on the walls]
2669	
2670	ARTHUR	The wall is high, and yet will I leap down:
2671	Good ground, be pitiful and hurt me not!
2672	There's few or none do know me: if they did,
2673	This ship-boy's semblance hath disguised me quite.
2674	I am afraid; and yet I'll venture it.
2675	If I get down, and do not break my limbs,
2676	I'll find a thousand shifts to get away:
2677	As good to die and go, as die and stay.
2678	
2679	[Leaps down]
2680	
2681	O me! my uncle's spirit is in these stones:
2682	Heaven take my soul, and England keep my bones!
2683	
2684	[Dies]
2685	
2686	[Enter PEMBROKE, SALISBURY, and BIGOT]
2687	
2688	SALISBURY	Lords, I will meet him at Saint Edmundsbury:
2689	It is our safety, and we must embrace
2690	This gentle offer of the perilous time.
2691	
2692	PEMBROKE	Who brought that letter from the cardinal?
2693	
2694	SALISBURY	The Count Melun, a noble lord of France,
2695	Whose private with me of the Dauphin's love
2696	Is much more general than these lines import.
2697	
2698	BIGOT	To-morrow morning let us meet him then.
2699	
2700	SALISBURY	Or rather then set forward; for 'twill be
2701	Two long days' journey, lords, or ere we meet.
2702	
2703	[Enter the BASTARD]
2704	
2705	BASTARD	Once more to-day well met, distemper'd lords!
2706	The king by me requests your presence straight.
2707	
2708	SALISBURY	The king hath dispossess'd himself of us:
2709	We will not line his thin bestained cloak
2710	With our pure honours, nor attend the foot
2711	That leaves the print of blood where'er it walks.
2712	Return and tell him so: we know the worst.
2713	
2714	BASTARD	Whate'er you think, good words, I think, were best.
2715	
2716	SALISBURY	Our griefs, and not our manners, reason now.
2717	
2718	BASTARD	But there is little reason in your grief;
2719	Therefore 'twere reason you had manners now.
2720	
2721	PEMBROKE	Sir, sir, impatience hath his privilege.
2722	
2723	BASTARD	'Tis true, to hurt his master, no man else.
2724	
2725	SALISBURY	This is the prison. What is he lies here?
2726	
2727	[Seeing ARTHUR]
2728	
2729	PEMBROKE	O death, made proud with pure and princely beauty!
2730	The earth had not a hole to hide this deed.
2731	
2732	SALISBURY	Murder, as hating what himself hath done,
2733	Doth lay it open to urge on revenge.
2734	
2735	BIGOT	Or, when he doom'd this beauty to a grave,
2736	Found it too precious-princely for a grave.
2737	
2738	SALISBURY	Sir Richard, what think you? have you beheld,
2739	Or have you read or heard? or could you think?
2740	Or do you almost think, although you see,
2741	That you do see? could thought, without this object,
2742	Form such another? This is the very top,
2743	The height, the crest, or crest unto the crest,
2744	Of murder's arms: this is the bloodiest shame,
2745	The wildest savagery, the vilest stroke,
2746	That ever wall-eyed wrath or staring rage
2747	Presented to the tears of soft remorse.
2748	
2749	PEMBROKE	All murders past do stand excused in this:
2750	And this, so sole and so unmatchable,
2751	Shall give a holiness, a purity,
2752	To the yet unbegotten sin of times;
2753	And prove a deadly bloodshed but a jest,
2754	Exampled by this heinous spectacle.
2755	
2756	BASTARD	It is a damned and a bloody work;
2757	The graceless action of a heavy hand,
2758	If that it be the work of any hand.
2759	
2760	SALISBURY	If that it be the work of any hand!
2761	We had a kind of light what would ensue:
2762	It is the shameful work of Hubert's hand;
2763	The practise and the purpose of the king:
2764	From whose obedience I forbid my soul,
2765	Kneeling before this ruin of sweet life,
2766	And breathing to his breathless excellence
2767	The incense of a vow, a holy vow,
2768	Never to taste the pleasures of the world,
2769	Never to be infected with delight,
2770	Nor conversant with ease and idleness,
2771	Till I have set a glory to this hand,
2772	By giving it the worship of revenge.
2773	
2774	
2775	PEMBROKE	|
2776	|  Our souls religiously confirm thy words.
2777	BIGOT	|
2778	
2779	
2780	[Enter HUBERT]
2781	
2782	HUBERT	Lords, I am hot with haste in seeking you:
2783	Arthur doth live; the king hath sent for you.
2784	
2785	SALISBURY	O, he is old and blushes not at death.
2786	Avaunt, thou hateful villain, get thee gone!
2787	
2788	HUBERT	I am no villain.
2789	
2790	SALISBURY	                  Must I rob the law?
2791	
2792	[Drawing his sword]
2793	
2794	BASTARD	Your sword is bright, sir; put it up again.
2795	
2796	SALISBURY	Not till I sheathe it in a murderer's skin.
2797	
2798	HUBERT	Stand back, Lord Salisbury, stand back, I say;
2799	By heaven, I think my sword's as sharp as yours:
2800	I would not have you, lord, forget yourself,
2801	Nor tempt the danger of my true defence;
2802	Lest I, by marking of your rage, forget
2803	Your worth, your greatness and nobility.
2804	
2805	BIGOT	Out, dunghill! darest thou brave a nobleman?
2806	
2807	HUBERT	Not for my life: but yet I dare defend
2808	My innocent life against an emperor.
2809	
2810	SALISBURY	Thou art a murderer.
2811	
2812	HUBERT	Do not prove me so;
2813	Yet I am none: whose tongue soe'er speaks false,
2814	Not truly speaks; who speaks not truly, lies.
2815	
2816	PEMBROKE	Cut him to pieces.
2817	
2818	BASTARD	                  Keep the peace, I say.
2819	
2820	SALISBURY	Stand by, or I shall gall you, Faulconbridge.
2821	
2822	BASTARD	Thou wert better gall the devil, Salisbury:
2823	If thou but frown on me, or stir thy foot,
2824	Or teach thy hasty spleen to do me shame,
2825	I'll strike thee dead. Put up thy sword betime;
2826	Or I'll so maul you and your toasting-iron,
2827	That you shall think the devil is come from hell.
2828	
2829	BIGOT	What wilt thou do, renowned Faulconbridge?
2830	Second a villain and a murderer?
2831	
2832	HUBERT	Lord Bigot, I am none.
2833	
2834	BIGOT	Who kill'd this prince?
2835	
2836	HUBERT	'Tis not an hour since I left him well:
2837	I honour'd him, I loved him, and will weep
2838	My date of life out for his sweet life's loss.
2839	
2840	SALISBURY	Trust not those cunning waters of his eyes,
2841	For villany is not without such rheum;
2842	And he, long traded in it, makes it seem
2843	Like rivers of remorse and innocency.
2844	Away with me, all you whose souls abhor
2845	The uncleanly savours of a slaughter-house;
2846	For I am stifled with this smell of sin.
2847	
2848	BIGOT	Away toward Bury, to the Dauphin there!
2849	
2850	PEMBROKE	There tell the king he may inquire us out.
2851	
2852	[Exeunt Lords]
2853	
2854	BASTARD	Here's a good world! Knew you of this fair work?
2855	Beyond the infinite and boundless reach
2856	Of mercy, if thou didst this deed of death,
2857	Art thou damn'd, Hubert.
2858	
2859	HUBERT	Do but hear me, sir.
2860	
2861	BASTARD	Ha! I'll tell thee what;
2862	Thou'rt damn'd as black--nay, nothing is so black;
2863	Thou art more deep damn'd than Prince Lucifer:
2864	There is not yet so ugly a fiend of hell
2865	As thou shalt be, if thou didst kill this child.
2866	
2867	HUBERT	Upon my soul--
2868	
2869	BASTARD	                  If thou didst but consent
2870	To this most cruel act, do but despair;
2871	And if thou want'st a cord, the smallest thread
2872	That ever spider twisted from her womb
2873	Will serve to strangle thee, a rush will be a beam
2874	To hang thee on; or wouldst thou drown thyself,
2875	Put but a little water in a spoon,
2876	And it shall be as all the ocean,
2877	Enough to stifle such a villain up.
2878	I do suspect thee very grievously.
2879	
2880	HUBERT	If I in act, consent, or sin of thought,
2881	Be guilty of the stealing that sweet breath
2882	Which was embounded in this beauteous clay,
2883	Let hell want pains enough to torture me.
2884	I left him well.
2885	
2886	BASTARD	                  Go, bear him in thine arms.
2887	I am amazed, methinks, and lose my way
2888	Among the thorns and dangers of this world.
2889	How easy dost thou take all England up!
2890	From forth this morsel of dead royalty,
2891	The life, the right and truth of all this realm
2892	Is fled to heaven; and England now is left
2893	To tug and scamble and to part by the teeth
2894	The unowed interest of proud-swelling state.
2895	Now for the bare-pick'd bone of majesty
2896	Doth dogged war bristle his angry crest
2897	And snarleth in the gentle eyes of peace:
2898	Now powers from home and discontents at home
2899	Meet in one line; and vast confusion waits,
2900	As doth a raven on a sick-fall'n beast,
2901	The imminent decay of wrested pomp.
2902	Now happy he whose cloak and cincture can
2903	Hold out this tempest. Bear away that child
2904	And follow me with speed: I'll to the king:
2905	A thousand businesses are brief in hand,
2906	And heaven itself doth frown upon the land.

2920	
2921	
2922	[Enter KING JOHN, CARDINAL PANDULPH, and Attendants]
2923	
2924	KING JOHN	Thus have I yielded up into your hand
2925	The circle of my glory.
2926	
2927	[Giving the crown]
2928	
2929	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Take again
2930	From this my hand, as holding of the pope
2931	Your sovereign greatness and authority.
2932	
2933	KING JOHN	Now keep your holy word: go meet the French,
2934	And from his holiness use all your power
2935	To stop their marches 'fore we are inflamed.
2936	Our discontented counties do revolt;
2937	Our people quarrel with obedience,
2938	Swearing allegiance and the love of soul
2939	To stranger blood, to foreign royalty.
2940	This inundation of mistemper'd humour
2941	Rests by you only to be qualified:
2942	Then pause not; for the present time's so sick,
2943	That present medicine must be minister'd,
2944	Or overthrow incurable ensues.
2945	
2946	CARDINAL PANDULPH	It was my breath that blew this tempest up,
2947	Upon your stubborn usage of the pope;
2948	But since you are a gentle convertite,
2949	My tongue shall hush again this storm of war
2950	And make fair weather in your blustering land.
2951	On this Ascension-day, remember well,
2952	Upon your oath of service to the pope,
2953	Go I to make the French lay down their arms.
2954	
2955	[Exit]
2956	
2957	KING JOHN	Is this Ascension-day? Did not the prophet
2958	Say that before Ascension-day at noon
2959	My crown I should give off? Even so I have:
2960	I did suppose it should be on constraint:
2961	But, heaven be thank'd, it is but voluntary.
2962	
2963	[Enter the BASTARD]
2964	
2965	BASTARD	All Kent hath yielded; nothing there holds out
2966	But Dover castle: London hath received,
2967	Like a kind host, the Dauphin and his powers:
2968	Your nobles will not hear you, but are gone
2969	To offer service to your enemy,
2970	And wild amazement hurries up and down
2971	The little number of your doubtful friends.
2972	
2973	KING JOHN	Would not my lords return to me again,
2974	After they heard young Arthur was alive?
2975	
2976	BASTARD	They found him dead and cast into the streets,
2977	An empty casket, where the jewel of life
2978	By some damn'd hand was robb'd and ta'en away.
2979	
2980	KING JOHN	That villain Hubert told me he did live.
2981	
2982	BASTARD	So, on my soul, he did, for aught he knew.
2983	But wherefore do you droop? why look you sad?
2984	Be great in act, as you have been in thought;
2985	Let not the world see fear and sad distrust
2986	Govern the motion of a kingly eye:
2987	Be stirring as the time; be fire with fire;
2988	Threaten the threatener and outface the brow
2989	Of bragging horror: so shall inferior eyes,
2990	That borrow their behaviors from the great,
2991	Grow great by your example and put on
2992	The dauntless spirit of resolution.
2993	Away, and glister like the god of war,
2994	When he intendeth to become the field:
2995	Show boldness and aspiring confidence.
2996	What, shall they seek the lion in his den,
2997	And fright him there? and make him tremble there?
2998	O, let it not be said: forage, and run
2999	To meet displeasure farther from the doors,
3000	And grapple with him ere he comes so nigh.
3001	
3002	KING JOHN	The legate of the pope hath been with me,
3003	And I have made a happy peace with him;
3004	And he hath promised to dismiss the powers
3005	Led by the Dauphin.
3006	
3007	BASTARD	O inglorious league!
3008	Shall we, upon the footing of our land,
3009	Send fair-play orders and make compromise,
3010	Insinuation, parley and base truce
3011	To arms invasive? shall a beardless boy,
3012	A cocker'd silken wanton, brave our fields,
3013	And flesh his spirit in a warlike soil,
3014	Mocking the air with colours idly spread,
3015	And find no cheque? Let us, my liege, to arms:
3016	Perchance the cardinal cannot make your peace;
3017	Or if he do, let it at least be said
3018	They saw we had a purpose of defence.
3019	
3020	KING JOHN	Have thou the ordering of this present time.
3021	
3022	BASTARD	Away, then, with good courage! yet, I know,
3023	Our party may well meet a prouder foe.

3040	[Enter, in arms, LEWIS, SALISBURY, MELUN, PEMBROKE,
3041	BIGOT, and Soldiers]
3042	
3043	LEWIS	My Lord Melun, let this be copied out,
3044	And keep it safe for our remembrance:
3045	Return the precedent to these lords again;
3046	That, having our fair order written down,
3047	Both they and we, perusing o'er these notes,
3048	May know wherefore we took the sacrament
3049	And keep our faiths firm and inviolable.
3050	
3051	SALISBURY	Upon our sides it never shall be broken.
3052	And, noble Dauphin, albeit we swear
3053	A voluntary zeal and an unurged faith
3054	To your proceedings; yet believe me, prince,
3055	I am not glad that such a sore of time
3056	Should seek a plaster by contemn'd revolt,
3057	And heal the inveterate canker of one wound
3058	By making many. O, it grieves my soul,
3059	That I must draw this metal from my side
3060	To be a widow-maker! O, and there
3061	Where honourable rescue and defence
3062	Cries out upon the name of Salisbury!
3063	But such is the infection of the time,
3064	That, for the health and physic of our right,
3065	We cannot deal but with the very hand
3066	Of stern injustice and confused wrong.
3067	And is't not pity, O my grieved friends,
3068	That we, the sons and children of this isle,
3069	Were born to see so sad an hour as this;
3070	Wherein we step after a stranger march
3071	Upon her gentle bosom, and fill up
3072	Her enemies' ranks,--I must withdraw and weep
3073	Upon the spot of this enforced cause,--
3074	To grace the gentry of a land remote,
3075	And follow unacquainted colours here?
3076	What, here? O nation, that thou couldst remove!
3077	That Neptune's arms, who clippeth thee about,
3078	Would bear thee from the knowledge of thyself,
3079	And grapple thee unto a pagan shore;
3080	Where these two Christian armies might combine
3081	The blood of malice in a vein of league,
3082	And not to spend it so unneighbourly!
3083	
3084	LEWIS	A noble temper dost thou show in this;
3085	And great affections wrestling in thy bosom
3086	Doth make an earthquake of nobility.
3087	O, what a noble combat hast thou fought
3088	Between compulsion and a brave respect!
3089	Let me wipe off this honourable dew,
3090	That silverly doth progress on thy cheeks:
3091	My heart hath melted at a lady's tears,
3092	Being an ordinary inundation;
3093	But this effusion of such manly drops,
3094	This shower, blown up by tempest of the soul,
3095	Startles mine eyes, and makes me more amazed
3096	Than had I seen the vaulty top of heaven
3097	Figured quite o'er with burning meteors.
3098	Lift up thy brow, renowned Salisbury,
3099	And with a great heart heave away the storm:
3100	Commend these waters to those baby eyes
3101	That never saw the giant world enraged;
3102	Nor met with fortune other than at feasts,
3103	Full of warm blood, of mirth, of gossiping.
3104	Come, come; for thou shalt thrust thy hand as deep
3105	Into the purse of rich prosperity
3106	As Lewis himself: so, nobles, shall you all,
3107	That knit your sinews to the strength of mine.
3108	And even there, methinks, an angel spake:
3109	
3110	[Enter CARDINAL PANDULPH]
3111	
3112	Look, where the holy legate comes apace,
3113	To give us warrant from the hand of heaven
3114	And on our actions set the name of right
3115	With holy breath.
3116	
3117	CARDINAL PANDULPH	                  Hail, noble prince of France!
3118	The next is this, King John hath reconciled
3119	Himself to Rome; his spirit is come in,
3120	That so stood out against the holy church,
3121	The great metropolis and see of Rome:
3122	Therefore thy threatening colours now wind up;
3123	And tame the savage spirit of wild war,
3124	That like a lion foster'd up at hand,
3125	It may lie gently at the foot of peace,
3126	And be no further harmful than in show.
3127	
3128	LEWIS	Your grace shall pardon me, I will not back:
3129	I am too high-born to be propertied,
3130	To be a secondary at control,
3131	Or useful serving-man and instrument,
3132	To any sovereign state throughout the world.
3133	Your breath first kindled the dead coal of wars
3134	Between this chastised kingdom and myself,
3135	And brought in matter that should feed this fire;
3136	And now 'tis far too huge to be blown out
3137	With that same weak wind which enkindled it.
3138	You taught me how to know the face of right,
3139	Acquainted me with interest to this land,
3140	Yea, thrust this enterprise into my heart;
3141	And come ye now to tell me John hath made
3142	His peace with Rome? What is that peace to me?
3143	I, by the honour of my marriage-bed,
3144	After young Arthur, claim this land for mine;
3145	And, now it is half-conquer'd, must I back
3146	Because that John hath made his peace with Rome?
3147	Am I Rome's slave? What penny hath Rome borne,
3148	What men provided, what munition sent,
3149	To underprop this action? Is't not I
3150	That undergo this charge? who else but I,
3151	And such as to my claim are liable,
3152	Sweat in this business and maintain this war?
3153	Have I not heard these islanders shout out
3154	'Vive le roi!' as I have bank'd their towns?
3155	Have I not here the best cards for the game,
3156	To win this easy match play'd for a crown?
3157	And shall I now give o'er the yielded set?
3158	No, no, on my soul, it never shall be said.
3159	
3160	CARDINAL PANDULPH	You look but on the outside of this work.
3161	
3162	LEWIS	Outside or inside, I will not return
3163	Till my attempt so much be glorified
3164	As to my ample hope was promised
3165	Before I drew this gallant head of war,
3166	And cull'd these fiery spirits from the world,
3167	To outlook conquest and to win renown
3168	Even in the jaws of danger and of death.
3169	
3170	[Trumpet sounds]
3171	
3172	What lusty trumpet thus doth summon us?
3173	
3174	[Enter the BASTARD, attended]
3175	
3176	BASTARD	According to the fair play of the world,
3177	Let me have audience; I am sent to speak:
3178	My holy lord of Milan, from the king
3179	I come, to learn how you have dealt for him;
3180	And, as you answer, I do know the scope
3181	And warrant limited unto my tongue.
3182	
3183	CARDINAL PANDULPH	The Dauphin is too wilful-opposite,
3184	And will not temporize with my entreaties;
3185	He flatly says he'll not lay down his arms.
3186	
3187	BASTARD	By all the blood that ever fury breathed,
3188	The youth says well. Now hear our English king;
3189	For thus his royalty doth speak in me.
3190	He is prepared, and reason too he should:
3191	This apish and unmannerly approach,
3192	This harness'd masque and unadvised revel,
3193	This unhair'd sauciness and boyish troops,
3194	The king doth smile at; and is well prepared
3195	To whip this dwarfish war, these pigmy arms,
3196	From out the circle of his territories.
3197	That hand which had the strength, even at your door,
3198	To cudgel you and make you take the hatch,
3199	To dive like buckets in concealed wells,
3200	To crouch in litter of your stable planks,
3201	To lie like pawns lock'd up in chests and trunks,
3202	To hug with swine, to seek sweet safety out
3203	In vaults and prisons, and to thrill and shake
3204	Even at the crying of your nation's crow,
3205	Thinking his voice an armed Englishman;
3206	Shall that victorious hand be feebled here,
3207	That in your chambers gave you chastisement?
3208	No: know the gallant monarch is in arms
3209	And like an eagle o'er his aery towers,
3210	To souse annoyance that comes near his nest.
3211	And you degenerate, you ingrate revolts,
3212	You bloody Neroes, ripping up the womb
3213	Of your dear mother England, blush for shame;
3214	For your own ladies and pale-visaged maids
3215	Like Amazons come tripping after drums,
3216	Their thimbles into armed gauntlets change,
3217	Their needles to lances, and their gentle hearts
3218	To fierce and bloody inclination.
3219	
3220	LEWIS	There end thy brave, and turn thy face in peace;
3221	We grant thou canst outscold us: fare thee well;
3222	We hold our time too precious to be spent
3223	With such a brabbler.
3224	
3225	CARDINAL PANDULPH	Give me leave to speak.
3226	
3227	BASTARD	No, I will speak.
3228	
3229	LEWIS	                  We will attend to neither.
3230	Strike up the drums; and let the tongue of war
3231	Plead for our interest and our being here.
3232	
3233	BASTARD	Indeed your drums, being beaten, will cry out;
3234	And so shall you, being beaten: do but start
3235	An echo with the clamour of thy drum,
3236	And even at hand a drum is ready braced
3237	That shall reverberate all as loud as thine;
3238	Sound but another, and another shall
3239	As loud as thine rattle the welkin's ear
3240	And mock the deep-mouth'd thunder: for at hand,
3241	Not trusting to this halting legate here,
3242	Whom he hath used rather for sport than need
3243	Is warlike John; and in his forehead sits
3244	A bare-ribb'd death, whose office is this day
3245	To feast upon whole thousands of the French.
3246	
3247	LEWIS	Strike up our drums, to find this danger out.
3248	
3249	BASTARD	And thou shalt find it, Dauphin, do not doubt.

3266	[Alarums. Enter KING JOHN and HUBERT]
3267	
3268	KING JOHN	How goes the day with us? O, tell me, Hubert.
3269	
3270	HUBERT	Badly, I fear. How fares your majesty?
3271	
3272	KING JOHN	This fever, that hath troubled me so long,
3273	Lies heavy on me; O, my heart is sick!
3274	
3275	[Enter a Messenger]
3276	
3277	Messenger	My lord, your valiant kinsman, Faulconbridge,
3278	Desires your majesty to leave the field
3279	And send him word by me which way you go.
3280	
3281	KING JOHN	Tell him, toward Swinstead, to the abbey there.
3282	
3283	Messenger	Be of good comfort; for the great supply
3284	That was expected by the Dauphin here,
3285	Are wreck'd three nights ago on Goodwin Sands.
3286	This news was brought to Richard but even now:
3287	The French fight coldly, and retire themselves.
3288	
3289	KING JOHN	Ay me! this tyrant fever burns me up,
3290	And will not let me welcome this good news.
3291	Set on toward Swinstead: to my litter straight;
3292	Weakness possesseth me, and I am faint.
3293	
3294	[Exeunt]

3309	[Enter SALISBURY, PEMBROKE, and BIGOT]
3310	
3311	SALISBURY	I did not think the king so stored with friends.
3312	
3313	PEMBROKE	Up once again; put spirit in the French:
3314	If they miscarry, we miscarry too.
3315	
3316	SALISBURY	That misbegotten devil, Faulconbridge,
3317	In spite of spite, alone upholds the day.
3318	
3319	PEMBROKE	They say King John sore sick hath left the field.
3320	
3321	[Enter MELUN, wounded]
3322	
3323	MELUN	Lead me to the revolts of England here.
3324	
3325	SALISBURY	When we were happy we had other names.
3326	
3327	PEMBROKE	It is the Count Melun.
3328	
3329	SALISBURY	Wounded to death.
3330	
3331	MELUN	Fly, noble English, you are bought and sold;
3332	Unthread the rude eye of rebellion
3333	And welcome home again discarded faith.
3334	Seek out King John and fall before his feet;
3335	For if the French be lords of this loud day,
3336	He means to recompense the pains you take
3337	By cutting off your heads: thus hath he sworn
3338	And I with him, and many moe with me,
3339	Upon the altar at Saint Edmundsbury;
3340	Even on that altar where we swore to you
3341	Dear amity and everlasting love.
3342	
3343	SALISBURY	May this be possible? may this be true?
3344	
3345	MELUN	Have I not hideous death within my view,
3346	Retaining but a quantity of life,
3347	Which bleeds away, even as a form of wax
3348	Resolveth from his figure 'gainst the fire?
3349	What in the world should make me now deceive,
3350	Since I must lose the use of all deceit?
3351	Why should I then be false, since it is true
3352	That I must die here and live hence by truth?
3353	I say again, if Lewis do win the day,
3354	He is forsworn, if e'er those eyes of yours
3355	Behold another day break in the east:
3356	But even this night, whose black contagious breath
3357	Already smokes about the burning crest
3358	Of the old, feeble and day-wearied sun,
3359	Even this ill night, your breathing shall expire,
3360	Paying the fine of rated treachery
3361	Even with a treacherous fine of all your lives,
3362	If Lewis by your assistance win the day.
3363	Commend me to one Hubert with your king:
3364	The love of him, and this respect besides,
3365	For that my grandsire was an Englishman,
3366	Awakes my conscience to confess all this.
3367	In lieu whereof, I pray you, bear me hence
3368	From forth the noise and rumour of the field,
3369	Where I may think the remnant of my thoughts
3370	In peace, and part this body and my soul
3371	With contemplation and devout desires.
3372	
3373	SALISBURY	We do believe thee: and beshrew my soul
3374	But I do love the favour and the form
3375	Of this most fair occasion, by the which
3376	We will untread the steps of damned flight,
3377	And like a bated and retired flood,
3378	Leaving our rankness and irregular course,
3379	Stoop low within those bounds we have o'erlook'd
3380	And cabby run on in obedience
3381	Even to our ocean, to our great King John.
3382	My arm shall give thee help to bear thee hence;
3383	For I do see the cruel pangs of death
3384	Right in thine eye. Away, my friends! New flight;
3385	And happy newness, that intends old right.

3400	
3401	
3402	[Enter LEWIS and his train]
3403	
3404	LEWIS	The sun of heaven methought was loath to set,
3405	But stay'd and made the western welkin blush,
3406	When English measure backward their own ground
3407	In faint retire. O, bravely came we off,
3408	When with a volley of our needless shot,
3409	After such bloody toil, we bid good night;
3410	And wound our tattering colours clearly up,
3411	Last in the field, and almost lords of it!
3412	
3413	[Enter a Messenger]
3414	
3415	Messenger	Where is my prince, the Dauphin?
3416	
3417	LEWIS	Here: what news?
3418	
3419	Messenger	The Count Melun is slain; the English lords
3420	By his persuasion are again fall'n off,
3421	And your supply, which you have wish'd so long,
3422	Are cast away and sunk on Goodwin Sands.
3423	
3424	LEWIS	Ah, foul shrewd news! beshrew thy very heart!
3425	I did not think to be so sad to-night
3426	As this hath made me. Who was he that said
3427	King John did fly an hour or two before
3428	The stumbling night did part our weary powers?
3429	
3430	Messenger	Whoever spoke it, it is true, my lord.
3431	
3432	LEWIS	Well; keep good quarter and good care to-night:
3433	The day shall not be up so soon as I,
3434	To try the fair adventure of to-morrow.

3452	
3453	HUBERT	Who's there? speak, ho! speak quickly, or I shoot.
3454	
3455	BASTARD	A friend. What art thou?
3456	
3457	HUBERT	Of the part of England.
3458	
3459	BASTARD	Whither dost thou go?
3460	
3461	HUBERT	What's that to thee? why may not I demand
3462	Of thine affairs, as well as thou of mine?
3463	
3464	BASTARD	Hubert, I think?
3465	
3466	HUBERT	                  Thou hast a perfect thought:
3467	I will upon all hazards well believe
3468	Thou art my friend, that know'st my tongue so well.
3469	Who art thou?
3470	
3471	BASTARD	                  Who thou wilt: and if thou please,
3472	Thou mayst befriend me so much as to think
3473	I come one way of the Plantagenets.
3474	
3475	HUBERT	Unkind remembrance! thou and eyeless night
3476	Have done me shame: brave soldier, pardon me,
3477	That any accent breaking from thy tongue
3478	Should 'scape the true acquaintance of mine ear.
3479	
3480	BASTARD	Come, come; sans compliment, what news abroad?
3481	
3482	HUBERT	Why, here walk I in the black brow of night,
3483	To find you out.
3484	
3485	BASTARD	                  Brief, then; and what's the news?
3486	
3487	HUBERT	O, my sweet sir, news fitting to the night,
3488	Black, fearful, comfortless and horrible.
3489	
3490	BASTARD	Show me the very wound of this ill news:
3491	I am no woman, I'll not swoon at it.
3492	
3493	HUBERT	The king, I fear, is poison'd by a monk:
3494	I left him almost speechless; and broke out
3495	To acquaint you with this evil, that you might
3496	The better arm you to the sudden time,
3497	Than if you had at leisure known of this.
3498	
3499	BASTARD	How did he take it? who did taste to him?
3500	
3501	HUBERT	A monk, I tell you; a resolved villain,
3502	Whose bowels suddenly burst out: the king
3503	Yet speaks and peradventure may recover.
3504	
3505	BASTARD	Who didst thou leave to tend his majesty?
3506	
3507	HUBERT	Why, know you not? the lords are all come back,
3508	And brought Prince Henry in their company;
3509	At whose request the king hath pardon'd them,
3510	And they are all about his majesty.
3511	
3512	BASTARD	Withhold thine indignation, mighty heaven,
3513	And tempt us not to bear above our power!
3514	I'll tell tree, Hubert, half my power this night,
3515	Passing these flats, are taken by the tide;
3516	These Lincoln Washes have devoured them;
3517	Myself, well mounted, hardly have escaped.
3518	Away before: conduct me to the king;
3519	I doubt he will be dead or ere I come.

3534	
3535	
3536	[Enter PRINCE HENRY, SALISBURY, and BIGOT]
3537	
3538	PRINCE HENRY	It is too late: the life of all his blood
3539	Is touch'd corruptibly, and his pure brain,
3540	Which some suppose the soul's frail dwelling-house,
3541	Doth by the idle comments that it makes
3542	Foretell the ending of mortality.
3543	
3544	[Enter PEMBROKE]
3545	
3546	PEMBROKE	His highness yet doth speak, and holds belief
3547	That, being brought into the open air,
3548	It would allay the burning quality
3549	Of that fell poison which assaileth him.
3550	
3551	PRINCE HENRY	Let him be brought into the orchard here.
3552	Doth he still rage?
3553	
3554	[Exit BIGOT]
3555	
3556	PEMBROKE	He is more patient
3557	Than when you left him; even now he sung.
3558	
3559	PRINCE HENRY	O vanity of sickness! fierce extremes
3560	In their continuance will not feel themselves.
3561	Death, having prey'd upon the outward parts,
3562	Leaves them invisible, and his siege is now
3563	Against the mind, the which he pricks and wounds
3564	With many legions of strange fantasies,
3565	Which, in their throng and press to that last hold,
3566	Confound themselves. 'Tis strange that death
3567	should sing.
3568	I am the cygnet to this pale faint swan,
3569	Who chants a doleful hymn to his own death,
3570	And from the organ-pipe of frailty sings
3571	His soul and body to their lasting rest.
3572	
3573	SALISBURY	Be of good comfort, prince; for you are born
3574	To set a form upon that indigest
3575	Which he hath left so shapeless and so rude.
3576	
3577	[Enter Attendants, and BIGOT, carrying KING JOHN in a chair]
3578	
3579	KING JOHN	Ay, marry, now my soul hath elbow-room;
3580	It would not out at windows nor at doors.
3581	There is so hot a summer in my bosom,
3582	That all my bowels crumble up to dust:
3583	I am a scribbled form, drawn with a pen
3584	Upon a parchment, and against this fire
3585	Do I shrink up.
3586	
3587	PRINCE HENRY	                  How fares your majesty?
3588	
3589	KING JOHN	Poison'd,--ill fare--dead, forsook, cast off:
3590	And none of you will bid the winter come
3591	To thrust his icy fingers in my maw,
3592	Nor let my kingdom's rivers take their course
3593	Through my burn'd bosom, nor entreat the north
3594	To make his bleak winds kiss my parched lips
3595	And comfort me with cold. I do not ask you much,
3596	I beg cold comfort; and you are so strait
3597	And so ingrateful, you deny me that.
3598	
3599	PRINCE HENRY	O that there were some virtue in my tears,
3600	That might relieve you!
3601	
3602	KING JOHN	The salt in them is hot.
3603	Within me is a hell; and there the poison
3604	Is as a fiend confined to tyrannize
3605	On unreprievable condemned blood.
3606	
3607	[Enter the BASTARD]
3608	
3609	BASTARD	O, I am scalded with my violent motion,
3610	And spleen of speed to see your majesty!
3611	
3612	KING JOHN	O cousin, thou art come to set mine eye:
3613	The tackle of my heart is crack'd and burn'd,
3614	And all the shrouds wherewith my life should sail
3615	Are turned to one thread, one little hair:
3616	My heart hath one poor string to stay it by,
3617	Which holds but till thy news be uttered;
3618	And then all this thou seest is but a clod
3619	And module of confounded royalty.
3620	
3621	BASTARD	The Dauphin is preparing hitherward,
3622	Where heaven He knows how we shall answer him;
3623	For in a night the best part of my power,
3624	As I upon advantage did remove,
3625	Were in the Washes all unwarily
3626	Devoured by the unexpected flood.
3627	
3628	[KING JOHN dies]
3629	
3630	SALISBURY	You breathe these dead news in as dead an ear.
3631	My liege! my lord! but now a king, now thus.
3632	
3633	PRINCE HENRY	Even so must I run on, and even so stop.
3634	What surety of the world, what hope, what stay,
3635	When this was now a king, and now is clay?
3636	
3637	BASTARD	Art thou gone so? I do but stay behind
3638	To do the office for thee of revenge,
3639	And then my soul shall wait on thee to heaven,
3640	As it on earth hath been thy servant still.
3641	Now, now, you stars that move in your right spheres,
3642	Where be your powers? show now your mended faiths,
3643	And instantly return with me again,
3644	To push destruction and perpetual shame
3645	Out of the weak door of our fainting land.
3646	Straight let us seek, or straight we shall be sought;
3647	The Dauphin rages at our very heels.
3648	
3649	SALISBURY	It seems you know not, then, so much as we:
3650	The Cardinal Pandulph is within at rest,
3651	Who half an hour since came from the Dauphin,
3652	And brings from him such offers of our peace
3653	As we with honour and respect may take,
3654	With purpose presently to leave this war.
3655	
3656	BASTARD	He will the rather do it when he sees
3657	Ourselves well sinewed to our defence.
3658	
3659	SALISBURY	Nay, it is in a manner done already;
3660	For many carriages he hath dispatch'd
3661	To the sea-side, and put his cause and quarrel
3662	To the disposing of the cardinal:
3663	With whom yourself, myself and other lords,
3664	If you think meet, this afternoon will post
3665	To consummate this business happily.
3666	
3667	BASTARD	Let it be so: and you, my noble prince,
3668	With other princes that may best be spared,
3669	Shall wait upon your father's funeral.
3670	
3671	PRINCE HENRY	At Worcester must his body be interr'd;
3672	For so he will'd it.
3673	
3674	BASTARD	Thither shall it then:
3675	And happily may your sweet self put on
3676	The lineal state and glory of the land!
3677	To whom with all submission, on my knee
3678	I do bequeath my faithful services
3679	And true subjection everlastingly.
3680	
3681	SALISBURY	And the like tender of our love we make,
3682	To rest without a spot for evermore.
3683	
3684	PRINCE HENRY	I have a kind soul that would give you thanks
3685	And knows not how to do it but with tears.
3686	
3687	BASTARD	O, let us pay the time but needful woe,
3688	Since it hath been beforehand with our griefs.
3689	This England never did, nor never shall,
3690	Lie at the proud foot of a conqueror,
3691	But when it first did help to wound itself.
3692	Now these her princes are come home again,
3693	Come the three corners of the world in arms,
3694	And we shall shock them. Nought shall make us rue,
3695	If England to itself do rest but true.
3696	
3697	[Exeunt]

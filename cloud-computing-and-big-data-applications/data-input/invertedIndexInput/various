6	WHEN my love swears that she is made of truth,
7	I do believe her, though I know she lies,
8	That she might think me some untutor'd youth,
9	Unskilful in the world's false forgeries.
10	Thus vainly thinking that she thinks me young,
11	Although I know my years be past the best,
12	I smiling credit her false-speaking tongue,
13	Outfacing faults in love with love's ill rest.
14	But wherefore says my love that she is young?
15	And wherefore say not I that I am old?
16	O, love's best habit is a soothing tongue,
17	And age, in love, loves not to have years told.
18	Therefore I'll lie with love, and love with me,
19	Since that our faults in love thus smother'd be.
20	
21	
22	II.
23	
24	Two loves I have, of comfort and despair,
25	That like two spirits do suggest me still;
26	My better angel is a man right fair,
27	My worser spirit a woman colour'd ill.
28	To win me soon to hell, my female evil
29	Tempteth my better angel from my side,
30	And would corrupt my saint to be a devil,
31	Wooing his purity with her fair pride.
32	And whether that my angel be turn'd fiend,
33	Suspect I may, yet not directly tell:
34	For being both to me, both to each friend,
35	I guess one angel in another's hell;
36	The truth I shall not know, but live in doubt,
37	Till my bad angel fire my good one out.
38

40	III.
41	
42	Did not the heavenly rhetoric of thine eye,
43	'Gainst whom the world could not hold argument,
44	Persuade my heart to this false perjury?
45	Vows for thee broke deserve not punishment.
46	A woman I forswore; but I will prove,
47	Thou being a goddess, I forswore not thee:
48	My vow was earthly, thou a heavenly love;
49	Thy grace being gain'd cures all disgrace in me.
50	My vow was breath, and breath a vapour is;
51	Then, thou fair sun, that on this earth doth shine,
52	Exhale this vapour vow; in thee it is:
53	If broken, then it is no fault of mine.
54	If by me broke, what fool is not so wise
55	To break an oath, to win a paradise?
56

60	Sweet Cytherea, sitting by a brook
61	With young Adonis, lovely, fresh, and green,
62	Did court the lad with many a lovely look,
63	Such looks as none could look but beauty's queen.
64	She told him stories to delight his ear;
65	She showed him favors to allure his eye;
66	To win his heart, she touch'd him here and there,--
67	Touches so soft still conquer chastity.
68	But whether unripe years did want conceit,
69	Or he refused to take her figured proffer,
70	The tender nibbler would not touch the bait,
71	But smile and jest at every gentle offer:
72	Then fell she on her back, fair queen, and toward:
73	He rose and ran away; ah, fool too froward!
74	
75	
76	V.
77	
78	If love make me forsworn, how shall I swear to love?
79	O never faith could hold, if not to beauty vow'd:
80	Though to myself forsworn, to thee I'll constant prove;
81	Those thoughts, to me like oaks, to thee like osiers bow'd.
82	Study his bias leaves, and makes his book thine eyes,
83	Where all those pleasures live that art can comprehend.
84	If knowledge be the mark, to know thee shall suffice;
85	Well learned is that tongue that well can thee commend;
86	All ignorant that soul that sees thee without wonder;
87	Which is to me some praise, that I thy parts admire:
88	Thine eye Jove's lightning seems, thy voice his dreadful
89	thunder,
90	Which, not to anger bent, is music and sweet fire.
91	Celestial as thou art, O do not love that wrong,
92	To sing heaven's praise with such an earthly tongue.
93	
94	
95	VI.
96	
97	Scarce had the sun dried up the dewy morn,
98	And scarce the herd gone to the hedge for shade,
99	When Cytherea, all in love forlorn,
100	A longing tarriance for Adonis made
101	Under an osier growing by a brook,
102	A brook where Adon used to cool his spleen:
103	Hot was the day; she hotter that did look
104	For his approach, that often there had been.
105	Anon he comes, and throws his mantle by,
106	And stood stark naked on the brook's green brim:
107	The sun look'd on the world with glorious eye,
108	Yet not so wistly as this queen on him.
109	He, spying her, bounced in, whereas he stood:
110	'O Jove,' quoth she, 'why was not I a flood!'
111	
112	
113	VII.
114	
115	Fair is my love, but not so fair as fickle;
116	Mild as a dove, but neither true nor trusty;
117	Brighter than glass, and yet, as glass is, brittle;
118	Softer than wax, and yet, as iron, rusty:
119	A lily pale, with damask dye to grace her,
120	None fairer, nor none falser to deface her.
121	
122	Her lips to mine how often hath she joined,
123	Between each kiss her oaths of true love swearing!
124	How many tales to please me hath she coined,
125	Dreading my love, the loss thereof still fearing!
126	Yet in the midst of all her pure protestings,
127	Her faith, her oaths, her tears, and all were jestings.
128	
129	She burn'd with love, as straw with fire flameth;
130	She burn'd out love, as soon as straw outburneth;
131	She framed the love, and yet she foil'd the framing;
132	She bade love last, and yet she fell a-turning.
133	Was this a lover, or a lecher whether?
134	Bad in the best, though excellent in neither.
135	
136	
137	VIII.
138	
139	If music and sweet poetry agree,
140	As they must needs, the sister and the brother,
141	Then must the love be great 'twixt thee and me,
142	Because thou lovest the one, and I the other.
143	Dowland to thee is dear, whose heavenly touch
144	Upon the lute doth ravish human sense;
145	Spenser to me, whose deep conceit is such
146	As, passing all conceit, needs no defence.
147	Thou lovest to hear the sweet melodious sound
148	That Phoebus' lute, the queen of music, makes;
149	And I in deep delight am chiefly drown'd
150	When as himself to singing he betakes.
151	One god is god of both, as poets feign;
152	One knight loves both, and both in thee remain.
153	
154

156	
157	Fair was the morn when the fair queen of love,
158	[		   ]
159	Paler for sorrow than her milk-white dove,
160	For Adon's sake, a youngster proud and wild;
161	Her stand she takes upon a steep-up hill:
162	Anon Adonis comes with horn and hounds;
163	She, silly queen, with more than love's good will,
164	Forbade the boy he should not pass those grounds:
165	'Once,' quoth she, 'did I see a fair sweet youth
166	Here in these brakes deep-wounded with a boar,
167	Deep in the thigh, a spectacle of ruth!
168	See, in my thigh,' quoth she, 'here was the sore.'
169	She showed hers: he saw more wounds than one,
170	And blushing fled, and left her all alone.
171	
172	
173	X.
174	
175	Sweet rose, fair flower, untimely pluck'd, soon vaded,
176	Pluck'd in the bud, and vaded in the spring!
177	Bright orient pearl, alack, too timely shaded!
178	Fair creature, kill'd too soon by death's sharp sting!
179	Like a green plum that hangs upon a tree,
180	And falls, through wind, before the fall should be.
181	
182	I weep for thee, and yet no cause I have;
183	For why thou left'st me nothing in thy will:
184	And yet thou left'st me more than I did crave;
185	For why I craved nothing of thee still:
186	O yes, dear friend, I pardon crave of thee,
187	Thy discontent thou didst bequeath to me.
188	
189	
190	XI.
191	
192	Venus, with young Adonis sitting by her
193	Under a myrtle shade, began to woo him:
194	She told the youngling how god Mars did try her,
195	And as he fell to her, so fell she to him.
196	'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god embraced me,'
197	And then she clipp'd Adonis in her arms;
198	'Even thus,' quoth she, 'the warlike god unlaced me,'
199	As if the boy should use like loving charms;
200	'Even thus,' quoth she, 'he seized on my lips,'
201	And with her lips on his did act the seizure:
202	And as she fetched breath, away he skips,
203	And would not take her meaning nor her pleasure.
204	Ah, that I had my lady at this bay,
205	To kiss and clip me till I run away!
206	
207	
208	XII.
209	
210	Crabbed age and youth cannot live together:
211	Youth is full of pleasance, age is full of care;
212	Youth like summer morn, age like winter weather;
213	Youth like summer brave, age like winter bare.
214	Youth is full of sport, age's breath is short;
215	Youth is nimble, age is lame;
216	Youth is hot and bold, age is weak and cold;
217	Youth is wild, and age is tame.
218	Age, I do abhor thee; youth, I do adore thee;
219	O, my love, my love is young!
220	Age, I do defy thee: O, sweet shepherd, hie thee,
221	For methinks thou stay'st too long,
222	
223	
224	XIII.
225	
226	Beauty is but a vain and doubtful good;
227	A shining gloss that vadeth suddenly;
228	A flower that dies when first it gins to bud;
229	A brittle glass that's broken presently:
230	A doubtful good, a gloss, a glass, a flower,
231	Lost, vaded, broken, dead within an hour.
232	
233	And as goods lost are seld or never found,
234	As vaded gloss no rubbing will refresh,
235	As flowers dead lie wither'd on the ground,
236	As broken glass no cement can redress,
237	So beauty blemish'd once's for ever lost,
238	In spite of physic, painting, pain and cost.
239	
240	
241	XIV.
242	
243	Good night, good rest. Ah, neither be my share:
244	She bade good night that kept my rest away;
245	And daff'd me to a cabin hang'd with care,
246	To descant on the doubts of my decay.
247	'Farewell,' quoth she, 'and come again tomorrow:'
248	Fare well I could not, for I supp'd with sorrow.
249	
250	Yet at my parting sweetly did she smile,
251	In scorn or friendship, nill I construe whether:
252	'T may be, she joy'd to jest at my exile,
253	'T may be, again to make me wander thither:
254	'Wander,' a word for shadows like myself,
255	As take the pain, but cannot pluck the pelf.
256	
257	
258	XV.
259	
260	Lord, how mine eyes throw gazes to the east!
261	My heart doth charge the watch; the morning rise
262	Doth cite each moving sense from idle rest.
263	Not daring trust the office of mine eyes,
264	While Philomela sits and sings, I sit and mark,
265	And wish her lays were tuned like the lark;
266	
267	For she doth welcome daylight with her ditty,
268	And drives away dark dismal-dreaming night:
269	The night so pack'd, I post unto my pretty;
270	Heart hath his hope, and eyes their wished sight;
271	Sorrow changed to solace, solace mix'd with sorrow;
272	For why, she sigh'd and bade me come tomorrow.
273	
274	Were I with her, the night would post too soon;
275	But now are minutes added to the hours;
276	To spite me now, each minute seems a moon;
277	Yet not for me, shine sun to succor flowers!
278	Pack night, peep day; good day, of night now borrow:
279	Short, night, to-night, and length thyself tomorrow.

287	
288	IT was a lording's daughter, the fairest one of three,
289	That liked of her master as well as well might be,
290	Till looking on an Englishman, the fair'st that eye could see,
291	Her fancy fell a-turning.
292	
293	Long was the combat doubtful that love with love did fight,
294	To leave the master loveless, or kill the gallant knight:
295	To put in practise either, alas, it was a spite
296	Unto the silly damsel!
297	
298	But one must be refused; more mickle was the pain
299	That nothing could be used to turn them both to gain,
300	For of the two the trusty knight was wounded with disdain:
301	Alas, she could not help it!
302	
303	Thus art with arms contending was victor of the day,
304	Which by a gift of learning did bear the maid away:
305	Then, lullaby, the learned man hath got the lady gay;
306	For now my song is ended.
307	
308	
309	XVII.
310	
311	On a day, alack the day!
312	Love, whose month was ever May,
313	Spied a blossom passing fair,
314	Playing in the wanton air:
315	Through the velvet leaves the wind
316	All unseen, gan passage find;
317	That the lover, sick to death,
318	Wish'd himself the heaven's breath,
319	'Air,' quoth he, 'thy cheeks may blow;
320	Air, would I might triumph so!
321	But, alas! my hand hath sworn
322	Ne'er to pluck thee from thy thorn:
323	Vow, alack! for youth unmeet:
324	Youth, so apt to pluck a sweet.
325	Thou for whom Jove would swear
326	Juno but an Ethiope were;
327	And deny himself for Jove,
328	Turning mortal for thy love.'
329	
330	
331	XVIII.
332	
333	My flocks feed not,
334	My ewes breed not,
335	My rams speed not,
336	All is amiss:
337	Love's denying,
338	Faith's defying,
339	Heart's renying,
340	Causer of this.
341	All my merry jigs are quite forgot,
342	All my lady's love is lost, God wot:
343	Where her faith was firmly fix'd in love,
344	There a nay is placed without remove.
345	One silly cross
346	Wrought all my loss;
347	O frowning Fortune, cursed, fickle dame!
348	For now I see
349	Inconstancy
350	More in women than in men remain.
351	In black mourn I,
352	All fears scorn I,
353	Love hath forlorn me,
354	Living in thrall:
355	Heart is bleeding,
356	All help needing,
357	O cruel speeding,
358	Fraughted with gall.
359	My shepherd's pipe can sound no deal;
360	My wether's bell rings doleful knell;
361	My curtail dog, that wont to have play'd
362	Plays not at all, but seems afraid;
363	My sighs so deep
364	Procure to weep,
365	In howling wise, to see my doleful plight.
366	How sighs resound
367	Through heartless ground,
368	Like a thousand vanquish'd men in bloody fight!
369	Clear wells spring not,
370	Sweet birds sing not,
371	Green plants bring not
372	Forth their dye;
373	Herds stand weeping,
374	Flocks all sleeping,
375	Nymphs back peeping
376	Fearfully:
377	All our pleasure known to us poor swains,
378	All our merry meetings on the plains,
379	All our evening sport from us is fled,
380	All our love is lost, for Love is dead
381	Farewell, sweet lass,
382	Thy like ne'er was
383	For a sweet content, the cause of all my moan:
384	Poor Corydon
385	Must live alone;
386	Other help for him I see that there is none.
387	
388	
389	XIX.
390	
391	When as thine eye hath chose the dame,
392	And stall'd the deer that thou shouldst strike,
393	Let reason rule things worthy blame,
394	As well as fancy partial might:
395	Take counsel of some wiser head,
396	Neither too young nor yet unwed.
397	
398	And when thou comest thy tale to tell,
399	Smooth not thy tongue with filed talk,
400	Lest she some subtle practise smell,--
401	A cripple soon can find a halt;--
402	But plainly say thou lovest her well,
403	
404	And set thy person forth to sell.
405	What though her frowning brows be bent,
406	Her cloudy looks will calm ere night:
407	And then too late she will repent
408	That thus dissembled her delight;
409	And twice desire, ere it be day,
410	That which with scorn she put away.
411	
412	What though she strive to try her strength,
413	And ban and brawl, and say thee nay,
414	Her feeble force will yield at length,
415	When craft hath taught her thus to say,
416	'Had women been so strong as men,
417	In faith, you had not had it then.'
418	
419	And to her will frame all thy ways;
420	Spare not to spend, and chiefly there
421	Where thy desert may merit praise,
422	By ringing in thy lady's ear:
423	The strongest castle, tower, and town,
424	The golden bullet beats it down.
425	
426	Serve always with assured trust,
427	And in thy suit be humble true;
428	Unless thy lady prove unjust,
429	Press never thou to choose anew:
430	When time shall serve, be thou not slack
431	To proffer, though she put thee back.
432	
433	The wiles and guiles that women work,
434	Dissembled with an outward show,
435	The tricks and toys that in them lurk,
436	The cock that treads them shall not know.
437	Have you not heard it said full oft,
438	A woman's nay doth stand for nought?
439	
440	Think women still to strive with men,
441	To sin and never for to saint:
442	There is no heaven, by holy then,
443	When time with age doth them attaint.
444	Were kisses all the joys in bed,
445	One woman would another wed.
446	
447	But, soft! enough, too much, I fear
448	Lest that my mistress hear my song,
449	She will not stick to round me i' the ear,
450	To teach my tongue to be so long:
451	Yet will she blush, here be it said,
452	To hear her secrets so bewray'd.
453	
454	
455	XX.
456	
457	Live with me, and be my love,
458	And we will all the pleasures prove
459	That hills and valleys, dales and fields,
460	And all the craggy mountains yields.
461	
462	There will we sit upon the rocks,
463	And see the shepherds feed their flocks,
464	By shallow rivers, by whose falls
465	Melodious birds sing madrigals.
466	
467	There will I make thee a bed of roses,
468	With a thousand fragrant posies,
469	A cap of flowers, and a kirtle
470	Embroider'd all with leaves of myrtle.
471	
472	A belt of straw and ivy buds,
473	With coral clasps and amber studs;
474	And if these pleasures may thee move,
475	Then live with me and be my love.
476	
477	
478	LOVE'S ANSWER.
479	
480	If that the world and love were young,
481	And truth in every shepherd's tongue,
482	These pretty pleasures might me move
483	To live with thee and be thy love.
484	
485	
486	XXI.
487	
488	As it fell upon a day
489	In the merry month of May,
490	Sitting in a pleasant shade
491	Which a grove of myrtles made,
492	Beasts did leap, and birds did sing,
493	Trees did grow, and plants did spring;
494	Every thing did banish moan,
495	Save the nightingale alone:
496	She, poor bird, as all forlorn,
497	Lean'd her breast up-till a thorn
498	And there sung the dolefull'st ditty,
499	That to hear it was great pity:
500	'Fie, fie, fie,' now would she cry;
501	'Tereu, tereu!' by and by;
502	That to hear her so complain,
503	Scarce I could from tears refrain;
504	For her griefs, so lively shown,
505	Made me think upon mine own.
506	Ah, thought I, thou mourn'st in vain!
507	None takes pity on thy pain:
508	Senseless trees they cannot hear thee;
509	Ruthless beasts they will not cheer thee:
510	King Pandion he is dead;
511	All thy friends are lapp'd in lead;
512	All thy fellow birds do sing,
513	Careless of thy sorrowing.
514	Even so, poor bird, like thee,
515	None alive will pity me.
516	Whilst as fickle Fortune smiled,
517	Thou and I were both beguiled.
518	Every one that flatters thee
519	Is no friend in misery.
520	Words are easy, like the wind;
521	Faithful friends are hard to find:
522	Every man will be thy friend
523	Whilst thou hast wherewith to spend;
524	But if store of crowns be scant,
525	No man will supply thy want.
526	If that one be prodigal,
527	Bountiful they will him call,
528	And with such-like flattering,
529	'Pity but he were a king;'
530	If he be addict to vice,
531	Quickly him they will entice;
532	If to women he be bent,
533	They have at commandement:
534	But if Fortune once do frown,
535	Then farewell his great renown
536	They that fawn'd on him before
537	Use his company no more.
538	He that is thy friend indeed,
539	He will help thee in thy need:
540	If thou sorrow, he will weep;
541	If thou wake, he cannot sleep;
542	Thus of every grief in heart
543	He with thee doth bear a part.
544	These are certain signs to know
545	Faithful friend from flattering foe.

552	
553	
554	LET the bird of loudest lay,
555	On the sole Arabian tree,
556	Herald sad and trumpet be,
557	To whose sound chaste wings obey.
558	
559	But thou shrieking harbinger,
560	Foul precurrer of the fiend,
561	Augur of the fever's end,
562	To this troop come thou not near!
563	
564	From this session interdict
565	Every fowl of tyrant wing,
566	Save the eagle, feather'd king:
567	Keep the obsequy so strict.
568	
569	Let the priest in surplice white,
570	That defunctive music can,
571	Be the death-divining swan,
572	Lest the requiem lack his right.
573	
574	And thou treble-dated crow,
575	That thy sable gender makest
576	With the breath thou givest and takest,
577	'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.
578	
579	Here the anthem doth commence:
580	Love and constancy is dead;
581	Phoenix and the turtle fled
582	In a mutual flame from hence.
583	
584	So they loved, as love in twain
585	Had the essence but in one;
586	Two distincts, division none:
587	Number there in love was slain.
588	
589	Hearts remote, yet not asunder;
590	Distance, and no space was seen
591	'Twixt the turtle and his queen:
592	But in them it were a wonder.
593	
594	So between them love did shine,
595	That the turtle saw his right
596	Flaming in the phoenix' sight;
597	Either was the other's mine.
598	
599	Property was thus appalled,
600	That the self was not the same;
601	Single nature's double name
602	Neither two nor one was called.
603	
604	Reason, in itself confounded,
605	Saw division grow together,
606	To themselves yet either neither,
607	Simple were so well compounded,
608	
609	That it cried, How true a twain
610	Seemeth this concordant one!
611	Love hath reason, reason none,
612	If what parts can so remain.
613	
614	Whereupon it made this threne
615	To the phoenix and the dove,
616	Co-supremes and stars of love,
617	As chorus to their tragic scene.
618	
619	THRENOS.
620	
621	Beauty, truth, and rarity,
622	Grace in all simplicity,
623	Here enclosed in cinders lie.
624	
625	Death is now the phoenix' nest
626	And the turtle's loyal breast
627	To eternity doth rest,
628	
629	Leaving no posterity:
630	'Twas not their infirmity,
631	It was married chastity.
632	
633	Truth may seem, but cannot be:
634	Beauty brag, but 'tis not she;
635	Truth and beauty buried be.
636	
637	To this urn let those repair
638	That are either true or fair
639	For these dead birds sigh a prayer.

106	JULIUS CAESAR
107	
108	
109	ACT I
110	
111	
112	
113	SCENE I	Rome. A street.
114	
115	
116	[Enter FLAVIUS, MARULLUS, and certain Commoners]
117	
118	FLAVIUS	Hence! home, you idle creatures get you home:
119	Is this a holiday? what! know you not,
120	Being mechanical, you ought not walk
121	Upon a labouring day without the sign
122	Of your profession? Speak, what trade art thou?
123	
124	First Commoner	Why, sir, a carpenter.
125	
126	MARULLUS	Where is thy leather apron and thy rule?
127	What dost thou with thy best apparel on?
128	You, sir, what trade are you?
129	
130	Second Commoner	Truly, sir, in respect of a fine workman, I am but,
131	as you would say, a cobbler.
132	
133	MARULLUS	But what trade art thou? answer me directly.
134	
135	Second Commoner	A trade, sir, that, I hope, I may use with a safe
136	conscience; which is, indeed, sir, a mender of bad soles.
137	
138	MARULLUS	What trade, thou knave? thou naughty knave, what trade?
139	
140	Second Commoner	Nay, I beseech you, sir, be not out with me: yet,
141	if you be out, sir, I can mend you.
142	
143	MARULLUS	What meanest thou by that? mend me, thou saucy fellow!
144	
145	Second Commoner	Why, sir, cobble you.
146	
147	FLAVIUS	Thou art a cobbler, art thou?
148	
149	Second Commoner	Truly, sir, all that I live by is with the awl: I
150	meddle with no tradesman's matters, nor women's
151	matters, but with awl. I am, indeed, sir, a surgeon
152	to old shoes; when they are in great danger, I
153	recover them. As proper men as ever trod upon
154	neat's leather have gone upon my handiwork.
155	
156	FLAVIUS	But wherefore art not in thy shop today?
157	Why dost thou lead these men about the streets?
158	
159	Second Commoner	Truly, sir, to wear out their shoes, to get myself
160	into more work. But, indeed, sir, we make holiday,
161	to see Caesar and to rejoice in his triumph.
162	
163	MARULLUS	Wherefore rejoice? What conquest brings he home?
164	What tributaries follow him to Rome,
165	To grace in captive bonds his chariot-wheels?
166	You blocks, you stones, you worse than senseless things!
167	O you hard hearts, you cruel men of Rome,
168	Knew you not Pompey? Many a time and oft
169	Have you climb'd up to walls and battlements,
170	To towers and windows, yea, to chimney-tops,
171	Your infants in your arms, and there have sat
172	The livelong day, with patient expectation,
173	To see great Pompey pass the streets of Rome:
174	And when you saw his chariot but appear,
175	Have you not made an universal shout,
176	That Tiber trembled underneath her banks,
177	To hear the replication of your sounds
178	Made in her concave shores?
179	And do you now put on your best attire?
180	And do you now cull out a holiday?
181	And do you now strew flowers in his way
182	That comes in triumph over Pompey's blood? Be gone!
183	Run to your houses, fall upon your knees,
184	Pray to the gods to intermit the plague
185	That needs must light on this ingratitude.
186	
187	FLAVIUS	Go, go, good countrymen, and, for this fault,
188	Assemble all the poor men of your sort;
189	Draw them to Tiber banks, and weep your tears
190	Into the channel, till the lowest stream
191	Do kiss the most exalted shores of all.
192	
193	[Exeunt all the Commoners]
194	
195	See whether their basest metal be not moved;
196	They vanish tongue-tied in their guiltiness.
197	Go you down that way towards the Capitol;
198	This way will I	disrobe the images,
199	If you do find them deck'd with ceremonies.
200	
201	MARULLUS	May we do so?
202	You know it is the feast of Lupercal.
203	
204	FLAVIUS	It is no matter; let no images
205	Be hung with Caesar's trophies. I'll about,
206	And drive away the vulgar from the streets:
207	So do you too, where you perceive them thick.
208	These growing feathers pluck'd from Caesar's wing
209	Will make him fly an ordinary pitch,
210	Who else would soar above the view of men
211	And keep us all in servile fearfulness.
212	
213	[Exeunt]

220	
221	ACT I
222	
223	
224	
225	SCENE II	A public place.
226	
227	
228	
229	[Flourish. Enter CAESAR; ANTONY, for the course;
230	CALPURNIA, PORTIA, DECIUS BRUTUS, CICERO, BRUTUS,
231	CASSIUS, and CASCA; a great crowd following, among
232	them a Soothsayer]
233	
234	CAESAR	Calpurnia!
235	
236	CASCA	         Peace, ho! Caesar speaks.
237	
238	CAESAR	Calpurnia!
239	
240	CALPURNIA	Here, my lord.
241	
242	CAESAR	Stand you directly in Antonius' way,
243	When he doth run his course. Antonius!
244	
245	ANTONY	Caesar, my lord?
246	
247	CAESAR	Forget not, in your speed, Antonius,
248	To touch Calpurnia; for our elders say,
249	The barren, touched in this holy chase,
250	Shake off their sterile curse.
251	
252	ANTONY	I shall remember:
253	When Caesar says 'do this,' it is perform'd.
254	
255	CAESAR	Set on; and leave no ceremony out.
256	
257	[Flourish]
258	
259	Soothsayer	Caesar!
260	
261	CAESAR	Ha! who calls?
262	
263	CASCA	Bid every noise be still: peace yet again!
264	
265	CAESAR	Who is it in the press that calls on me?
266	I hear a tongue, shriller than all the music,
267	Cry 'Caesar!' Speak; Caesar is turn'd to hear.
268	
269	Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.
270	
271	CAESAR	What man is that?
272	
273	BRUTUS	A soothsayer bids you beware the ides of March.
274	
275	CAESAR	Set him before me; let me see his face.
276	
277	CASSIUS	Fellow, come from the throng; look upon Caesar.
278	
279	CAESAR	What say'st thou to me now? speak once again.
280	
281	Soothsayer	Beware the ides of March.
282	
283	CAESAR	He is a dreamer; let us leave him: pass.
284	
285	[Sennet. Exeunt all except BRUTUS and CASSIUS]
286	
287	CASSIUS	Will you go see the order of the course?
288	
289	BRUTUS	Not I.
290	
291	CASSIUS	I pray you, do.
292	
293	BRUTUS	I am not gamesome: I do lack some part
294	Of that quick spirit that is in Antony.
295	Let me not hinder, Cassius, your desires;
296	I'll leave you.
297	
298	CASSIUS	Brutus, I do observe you now of late:
299	I have not from your eyes that gentleness
300	And show of love as I was wont to have:
301	You bear too stubborn and too strange a hand
302	Over your friend that loves you.
303	
304	BRUTUS	Cassius,
305	Be not deceived: if I have veil'd my look,
306	I turn the trouble of my countenance
307	Merely upon myself. Vexed I am
308	Of late with passions of some difference,
309	Conceptions only proper to myself,
310	Which give some soil perhaps to my behaviors;
311	But let not therefore my good friends be grieved--
312	Among which number, Cassius, be you one--
313	Nor construe any further my neglect,
314	Than that poor Brutus, with himself at war,
315	Forgets the shows of love to other men.
316	
317	CASSIUS	Then, Brutus, I have much mistook your passion;
318	By means whereof this breast of mine hath buried
319	Thoughts of great value, worthy cogitations.
320	Tell me, good Brutus, can you see your face?
321	
322	BRUTUS	No, Cassius; for the eye sees not itself,
323	But by reflection, by some other things.
324	
325	CASSIUS	'Tis just:
326	And it is very much lamented, Brutus,
327	That you have no such mirrors as will turn
328	Your hidden worthiness into your eye,
329	That you might see your shadow. I have heard,
330	Where many of the best respect in Rome,
331	Except immortal Caesar, speaking of Brutus
332	And groaning underneath this age's yoke,
333	Have wish'd that noble Brutus had his eyes.
334	
335	BRUTUS	Into what dangers would you lead me, Cassius,
336	That you would have me seek into myself
337	For that which is not in me?
338	
339	CASSIUS	Therefore, good Brutus, be prepared to hear:
340	And since you know you cannot see yourself
341	So well as by reflection, I, your glass,
342	Will modestly discover to yourself
343	That of yourself which you yet know not of.
344	And be not jealous on me, gentle Brutus:
345	Were I a common laugher, or did use
346	To stale with ordinary oaths my love
347	To every new protester; if you know
348	That I do fawn on men and hug them hard
349	And after scandal them, or if you know
350	That I profess myself in banqueting
351	To all the rout, then hold me dangerous.
352	
353	[Flourish, and shout]
354	
355	BRUTUS	What means this shouting? I do fear, the people
356	Choose Caesar for their king.
357	
358	CASSIUS	Ay, do you fear it?
359	Then must I think you would not have it so.
360	
361	BRUTUS	I would not, Cassius; yet I love him well.
362	But wherefore do you hold me here so long?
363	What is it that you would impart to me?
364	If it be aught toward the general good,
365	Set honour in one eye and death i' the other,
366	And I will look on both indifferently,
367	For let the gods so speed me as I love
368	The name of honour more than I fear death.
369	
370	CASSIUS	I know that virtue to be in you, Brutus,
371	As well as I do know your outward favour.
372	Well, honour is the subject of my story.
373	I cannot tell what you and other men
374	Think of this life; but, for my single self,
375	I had as lief not be as live to be
376	In awe of such a thing as I myself.
377	I was born free as Caesar; so were you:
378	We both have fed as well, and we can both
379	Endure the winter's cold as well as he:
380	For once, upon a raw and gusty day,
381	The troubled Tiber chafing with her shores,
382	Caesar said to me 'Darest thou, Cassius, now
383	Leap in with me into this angry flood,
384	And swim to yonder point?' Upon the word,
385	Accoutred as I was, I plunged in
386	And bade him follow; so indeed he did.
387	The torrent roar'd, and we did buffet it
388	With lusty sinews, throwing it aside
389	And stemming it with hearts of controversy;
390	But ere we could arrive the point proposed,
391	Caesar cried 'Help me, Cassius, or I sink!'
392	I, as Aeneas, our great ancestor,
393	Did from the flames of Troy upon his shoulder
394	The old Anchises bear, so from the waves of Tiber
395	Did I the tired Caesar. And this man
396	Is now become a god, and Cassius is
397	A wretched creature and must bend his body,
398	If Caesar carelessly but nod on him.
399	He had a fever when he was in Spain,
400	And when the fit was on him, I did mark
401	How he did shake: 'tis true, this god did shake;
402	His coward lips did from their colour fly,
403	And that same eye whose bend doth awe the world
404	Did lose his lustre: I did hear him groan:
405	Ay, and that tongue of his that bade the Romans
406	Mark him and write his speeches in their books,
407	Alas, it cried 'Give me some drink, Titinius,'
408	As a sick girl. Ye gods, it doth amaze me
409	A man of such a feeble temper should
410	So get the start of the majestic world
411	And bear the palm alone.
412	
413	[Shout. Flourish]
414	
415	BRUTUS	Another general shout!
416	I do believe that these applauses are
417	For some new honours that are heap'd on Caesar.
418	
419	CASSIUS	Why, man, he doth bestride the narrow world
420	Like a Colossus, and we petty men
421	Walk under his huge legs and peep about
422	To find ourselves dishonourable graves.
423	Men at some time are masters of their fates:
424	The fault, dear Brutus, is not in our stars,
425	But in ourselves, that we are underlings.
426	Brutus and Caesar: what should be in that 'Caesar'?
427	Why should that name be sounded more than yours?
428	Write them together, yours is as fair a name;
429	Sound them, it doth become the mouth as well;
430	Weigh them, it is as heavy; conjure with 'em,
431	Brutus will start a spirit as soon as Caesar.
432	Now, in the names of all the gods at once,
433	Upon what meat doth this our Caesar feed,
434	That he is grown so great? Age, thou art shamed!
435	Rome, thou hast lost the breed of noble bloods!
436	When went there by an age, since the great flood,
437	But it was famed with more than with one man?
438	When could they say till now, that talk'd of Rome,
439	That her wide walls encompass'd but one man?
440	Now is it Rome indeed and room enough,
441	When there is in it but one only man.
442	O, you and I have heard our fathers say,
443	There was a Brutus once that would have brook'd
444	The eternal devil to keep his state in Rome
445	As easily as a king.
446	
447	BRUTUS	That you do love me, I am nothing jealous;
448	What you would work me to, I have some aim:
449	How I have thought of this and of these times,
450	I shall recount hereafter; for this present,
451	I would not, so with love I might entreat you,
452	Be any further moved. What you have said
453	I will consider; what you have to say
454	I will with patience hear, and find a time
455	Both meet to hear and answer such high things.
456	Till then, my noble friend, chew upon this:
457	Brutus had rather be a villager
458	Than to repute himself a son of Rome
459	Under these hard conditions as this time
460	Is like to lay upon us.
461	
462	CASSIUS	I am glad that my weak words
463	Have struck but thus much show of fire from Brutus.
464	
465	BRUTUS	The games are done and Caesar is returning.
466	
467	CASSIUS	As they pass by, pluck Casca by the sleeve;
468	And he will, after his sour fashion, tell you
469	What hath proceeded worthy note to-day.
470	
471	[Re-enter CAESAR and his Train]
472	
473	BRUTUS	I will do so. But, look you, Cassius,
474	The angry spot doth glow on Caesar's brow,
475	And all the rest look like a chidden train:
476	Calpurnia's cheek is pale; and Cicero
477	Looks with such ferret and such fiery eyes
478	As we have seen him in the Capitol,
479	Being cross'd in conference by some senators.
480	
481	CASSIUS	Casca will tell us what the matter is.
482	
483	CAESAR	Antonius!
484	
485	ANTONY	Caesar?
486	
487	CAESAR	Let me have men about me that are fat;
488	Sleek-headed men and such as sleep o' nights:
489	Yond Cassius has a lean and hungry look;
490	He thinks too much: such men are dangerous.
491	
492	ANTONY	Fear him not, Caesar; he's not dangerous;
493	He is a noble Roman and well given.
494	
495	CAESAR	Would he were fatter! But I fear him not:
496	Yet if my name were liable to fear,
497	I do not know the man I should avoid
498	So soon as that spare Cassius. He reads much;
499	He is a great observer and he looks
500	Quite through the deeds of men: he loves no plays,
501	As thou dost, Antony; he hears no music;
502	Seldom he smiles, and smiles in such a sort
503	As if he mock'd himself and scorn'd his spirit
504	That could be moved to smile at any thing.
505	Such men as he be never at heart's ease
506	Whiles they behold a greater than themselves,
507	And therefore are they very dangerous.
508	I rather tell thee what is to be fear'd
509	Than what I fear; for always I am Caesar.
510	Come on my right hand, for this ear is deaf,
511	And tell me truly what thou think'st of him.
512	
513	[Sennet. Exeunt CAESAR and all his Train, but CASCA]
514	
515	CASCA	You pull'd me by the cloak; would you speak with me?
516	
517	BRUTUS	Ay, Casca; tell us what hath chanced to-day,
518	That Caesar looks so sad.
519	
520	CASCA	Why, you were with him, were you not?
521	
522	BRUTUS	I should not then ask Casca what had chanced.
523	
524	CASCA	Why, there was a crown offered him: and being
525	offered him, he put it by with the back of his hand,
526	thus; and then the people fell a-shouting.
527	
528	BRUTUS	What was the second noise for?
529	
530	CASCA	Why, for that too.
531	
532	CASSIUS	They shouted thrice: what was the last cry for?
533	
534	CASCA	Why, for that too.
535	
536	BRUTUS	Was the crown offered him thrice?
537	
538	CASCA	Ay, marry, was't, and he put it by thrice, every
539	time gentler than other, and at every putting-by
540	mine honest neighbours shouted.
541	
542	CASSIUS	Who offered him the crown?
543	
544	CASCA	Why, Antony.
545	
546	BRUTUS	Tell us the manner of it, gentle Casca.
547	
548	CASCA	I can as well be hanged as tell the manner of it:
549	it was mere foolery; I did not mark it. I saw Mark
550	Antony offer him a crown;--yet 'twas not a crown
551	neither, 'twas one of these coronets;--and, as I told
552	you, he put it by once: but, for all that, to my
553	thinking, he would fain have had it. Then he
554	offered it to him again; then he put it by again:
555	but, to my thinking, he was very loath to lay his
556	fingers off it. And then he offered it the third
557	time; he put it the third time by: and still as he
558	refused it, the rabblement hooted and clapped their
559	chapped hands and threw up their sweaty night-caps
560	and uttered such a deal of stinking breath because
561	Caesar refused the crown that it had almost choked
562	Caesar; for he swounded and fell down at it: and
563	for mine own part, I durst not laugh, for fear of
564	opening my lips and receiving the bad air.
565	
566	CASSIUS	But, soft, I pray you: what, did Caesar swound?
567	
568	CASCA	He fell down in the market-place, and foamed at
569	mouth, and was speechless.
570	
571	BRUTUS	'Tis very like: he hath the failing sickness.
572	
573	CASSIUS	No, Caesar hath it not; but you and I,
574	And honest Casca, we have the falling sickness.
575	
576	CASCA	I know not what you mean by that; but, I am sure,
577	Caesar fell down. If the tag-rag people did not
578	clap him and hiss him, according as he pleased and
579	displeased them, as they use to do the players in
580	the theatre, I am no true man.
581	
582	BRUTUS	What said he when he came unto himself?
583	
584	CASCA	Marry, before he fell down, when he perceived the
585	common herd was glad he refused the crown, he
586	plucked me ope his doublet and offered them his
587	throat to cut. An I had been a man of any
588	occupation, if I would not have taken him at a word,
589	I would I might go to hell among the rogues. And so
590	he fell. When he came to himself again, he said,
591	If he had done or said any thing amiss, he desired
592	their worships to think it was his infirmity. Three
593	or four wenches, where I stood, cried 'Alas, good
594	soul!' and forgave him with all their hearts: but
595	there's no heed to be taken of them; if Caesar had
596	stabbed their mothers, they would have done no less.
597	
598	BRUTUS	And after that, he came, thus sad, away?
599	
600	CASCA	Ay.
601	
602	CASSIUS	Did Cicero say any thing?
603	
604	CASCA	Ay, he spoke Greek.
605	
606	CASSIUS	To what effect?
607	
608	CASCA	Nay, an I tell you that, Ill ne'er look you i' the
609	face again: but those that understood him smiled at
610	one another and shook their heads; but, for mine own
611	part, it was Greek to me. I could tell you more
612	news too: Marullus and Flavius, for pulling scarfs
613	off Caesar's images, are put to silence. Fare you
614	well. There was more foolery yet, if I could
615	remember it.
616	
617	CASSIUS	Will you sup with me to-night, Casca?
618	
619	CASCA	No, I am promised forth.
620	
621	CASSIUS	Will you dine with me to-morrow?
622	
623	CASCA	Ay, if I be alive and your mind hold and your dinner
624	worth the eating.
625	
626	CASSIUS	Good: I will expect you.
627	
628	CASCA	Do so. Farewell, both.
629	
630	[Exit]
631	
632	BRUTUS	What a blunt fellow is this grown to be!
633	He was quick mettle when he went to school.
634	
635	CASSIUS	So is he now in execution
636	Of any bold or noble enterprise,
637	However he puts on this tardy form.
638	This rudeness is a sauce to his good wit,
639	Which gives men stomach to digest his words
640	With better appetite.
641	
642	BRUTUS	And so it is. For this time I will leave you:
643	To-morrow, if you please to speak with me,
644	I will come home to you; or, if you will,
645	Come home to me, and I will wait for you.
646	
647	CASSIUS	I will do so: till then, think of the world.
648	
649	[Exit BRUTUS]
650	
651	Well, Brutus, thou art noble; yet, I see,
652	Thy honourable metal may be wrought
653	From that it is disposed: therefore it is meet
654	That noble minds keep ever with their likes;
655	For who so firm that cannot be seduced?
656	Caesar doth bear me hard; but he loves Brutus:
657	If I were Brutus now and he were Cassius,
658	He should not humour me. I will this night,
659	In several hands, in at his windows throw,
660	As if they came from several citizens,
661	Writings all tending to the great opinion
662	That Rome holds of his name; wherein obscurely
663	Caesar's ambition shall be glanced at:
664	And after this let Caesar seat him sure;
665	For we will shake him, or worse days endure.
666	
667	[Exit]

671	
672	JULIUS CAESAR
673	
674	
675	ACT I
676	
677	
678	
679	SCENE III	The same. A street.
680	
681	
682	
683	
684	[Thunder and lightning. Enter from opposite sides,
685	CASCA, with his sword drawn, and CICERO]
686	
687	CICERO	Good even, Casca: brought you Caesar home?
688	Why are you breathless? and why stare you so?
689	
690	CASCA	Are not you moved, when all the sway of earth
691	Shakes like a thing unfirm? O Cicero,
692	I have seen tempests, when the scolding winds
693	Have rived the knotty oaks, and I have seen
694	The ambitious ocean swell and rage and foam,
695	To be exalted with the threatening clouds:
696	But never till to-night, never till now,
697	Did I go through a tempest dropping fire.
698	Either there is a civil strife in heaven,
699	Or else the world, too saucy with the gods,
700	Incenses them to send destruction.
701	
702	CICERO	Why, saw you any thing more wonderful?
703	
704	CASCA	A common slave--you know him well by sight--
705	Held up his left hand, which did flame and burn
706	Like twenty torches join'd, and yet his hand,
707	Not sensible of fire, remain'd unscorch'd.
708	Besides--I ha' not since put up my sword--
709	Against the Capitol I met a lion,
710	Who glared upon me, and went surly by,
711	Without annoying me: and there were drawn
712	Upon a heap a hundred ghastly women,
713	Transformed with their fear; who swore they saw
714	Men all in fire walk up and down the streets.
715	And yesterday the bird of night did sit
716	Even at noon-day upon the market-place,
717	Hooting and shrieking. When these prodigies
718	Do so conjointly meet, let not men say
719	'These are their reasons; they are natural;'
720	For, I believe, they are portentous things
721	Unto the climate that they point upon.
722	
723	CICERO	Indeed, it is a strange-disposed time:
724	But men may construe things after their fashion,
725	Clean from the purpose of the things themselves.
726	Come Caesar to the Capitol to-morrow?
727	
728	CASCA	He doth; for he did bid Antonius
729	Send word to you he would be there to-morrow.
730	
731	CICERO	Good night then, Casca: this disturbed sky
732	Is not to walk in.
733	
734	CASCA	Farewell, Cicero.
735	
736	[Exit CICERO]
737	
738	[Enter CASSIUS]
739	
740	CASSIUS	Who's there?
741	
742	CASCA	                  A Roman.
743	
744	CASSIUS	Casca, by your voice.
745	
746	CASCA	Your ear is good. Cassius, what night is this!
747	
748	CASSIUS	A very pleasing night to honest men.
749	
750	CASCA	Who ever knew the heavens menace so?
751	
752	CASSIUS	Those that have known the earth so full of faults.
753	For my part, I have walk'd about the streets,
754	Submitting me unto the perilous night,
755	And, thus unbraced, Casca, as you see,
756	Have bared my bosom to the thunder-stone;
757	And when the cross blue lightning seem'd to open
758	The breast of heaven, I did present myself
759	Even in the aim and very flash of it.
760	
761	CASCA	But wherefore did you so much tempt the heavens?
762	It is the part of men to fear and tremble,
763	When the most mighty gods by tokens send
764	Such dreadful heralds to astonish us.
765	
766	CASSIUS	You are dull, Casca, and those sparks of life
767	That should be in a Roman you do want,
768	Or else you use not. You look pale and gaze
769	And put on fear and cast yourself in wonder,
770	To see the strange impatience of the heavens:
771	But if you would consider the true cause
772	Why all these fires, why all these gliding ghosts,
773	Why birds and beasts from quality and kind,
774	Why old men fool and children calculate,
775	Why all these things change from their ordinance
776	Their natures and preformed faculties
777	To monstrous quality,--why, you shall find
778	That heaven hath infused them with these spirits,
779	To make them instruments of fear and warning
780	Unto some monstrous state.
781	Now could I, Casca, name to thee a man
782	Most like this dreadful night,
783	That thunders, lightens, opens graves, and roars
784	As doth the lion in the Capitol,
785	A man no mightier than thyself or me
786	In personal action, yet prodigious grown
787	And fearful, as these strange eruptions are.
788	
789	CASCA	'Tis Caesar that you mean; is it not, Cassius?
790	
791	CASSIUS	Let it be who it is: for Romans now
792	Have thews and limbs like to their ancestors;
793	But, woe the while! our fathers' minds are dead,
794	And we are govern'd with our mothers' spirits;
795	Our yoke and sufferance show us womanish.
796	
797	CASCA	Indeed, they say the senators tomorrow
798	Mean to establish Caesar as a king;
799	And he shall wear his crown by sea and land,
800	In every place, save here in Italy.
801	
802	CASSIUS	I know where I will wear this dagger then;
803	Cassius from bondage will deliver Cassius:
804	Therein, ye gods, you make the weak most strong;
805	Therein, ye gods, you tyrants do defeat:
806	Nor stony tower, nor walls of beaten brass,
807	Nor airless dungeon, nor strong links of iron,
808	Can be retentive to the strength of spirit;
809	But life, being weary of these worldly bars,
810	Never lacks power to dismiss itself.
811	If I know this, know all the world besides,
812	That part of tyranny that I do bear
813	I can shake off at pleasure.
814	
815	[Thunder still]
816	
817	CASCA	So can I:
818	So every bondman in his own hand bears
819	The power to cancel his captivity.
820	
821	CASSIUS	And why should Caesar be a tyrant then?
822	Poor man! I know he would not be a wolf,
823	But that he sees the Romans are but sheep:
824	He were no lion, were not Romans hinds.
825	Those that with haste will make a mighty fire
826	Begin it with weak straws: what trash is Rome,
827	What rubbish and what offal, when it serves
828	For the base matter to illuminate
829	So vile a thing as Caesar! But, O grief,
830	Where hast thou led me? I perhaps speak this
831	Before a willing bondman; then I know
832	My answer must be made. But I am arm'd,
833	And dangers are to me indifferent.
834	
835	CASCA	You speak to Casca, and to such a man
836	That is no fleering tell-tale. Hold, my hand:
837	Be factious for redress of all these griefs,
838	And I will set this foot of mine as far
839	As who goes farthest.
840	
841	CASSIUS	There's a bargain made.
842	Now know you, Casca, I have moved already
843	Some certain of the noblest-minded Romans
844	To undergo with me an enterprise
845	Of honourable-dangerous consequence;
846	And I do know, by this, they stay for me
847	In Pompey's porch: for now, this fearful night,
848	There is no stir or walking in the streets;
849	And the complexion of the element
850	In favour's like the work we have in hand,
851	Most bloody, fiery, and most terrible.
852	
853	CASCA	Stand close awhile, for here comes one in haste.
854	
855	CASSIUS	'Tis Cinna; I do know him by his gait;
856	He is a friend.
857	
858	[Enter CINNA]
859	
860	Cinna, where haste you so?
861	
862	CINNA	To find out you. Who's that? Metellus Cimber?
863	
864	CASSIUS	No, it is Casca; one incorporate
865	To our attempts. Am I not stay'd for, Cinna?
866	
867	CINNA	I am glad on 't. What a fearful night is this!
868	There's two or three of us have seen strange sights.
869	
870	CASSIUS	Am I not stay'd for? tell me.
871	
872	CINNA	Yes, you are.
873	O Cassius, if you could
874	But win the noble Brutus to our party--
875	
876	CASSIUS	Be you content: good Cinna, take this paper,
877	And look you lay it in the praetor's chair,
878	Where Brutus may but find it; and throw this
879	In at his window; set this up with wax
880	Upon old Brutus' statue: all this done,
881	Repair to Pompey's porch, where you shall find us.
882	Is Decius Brutus and Trebonius there?
883	
884	CINNA	All but Metellus Cimber; and he's gone
885	To seek you at your house. Well, I will hie,
886	And so bestow these papers as you bade me.
887	
888	CASSIUS	That done, repair to Pompey's theatre.
889	
890	[Exit CINNA]
891	
892	Come, Casca, you and I will yet ere day
893	See Brutus at his house: three parts of him
894	Is ours already, and the man entire
895	Upon the next encounter yields him ours.
896	
897	CASCA	O, he sits high in all the people's hearts:
898	And that which would appear offence in us,
899	His countenance, like richest alchemy,
900	Will change to virtue and to worthiness.
901	
902	CASSIUS	Him and his worth and our great need of him
903	You have right well conceited. Let us go,
904	For it is after midnight; and ere day
905	We will awake him and be sure of him.
906	
907	[Exeunt]
908

911	
912	JULIUS CAESAR
913	
914	
915	ACT II
916	
917	
918	
919	SCENE I	Rome. BRUTUS's orchard.
920	
921	
922	[Enter BRUTUS]
923	
924	BRUTUS	What, Lucius, ho!
925	I cannot, by the progress of the stars,
926	Give guess how near to day. Lucius, I say!
927	I would it were my fault to sleep so soundly.
928	When, Lucius, when? awake, I say! what, Lucius!
929	
930	[Enter LUCIUS]
931	
932	LUCIUS	Call'd you, my lord?
933	
934	BRUTUS	Get me a taper in my study, Lucius:
935	When it is lighted, come and call me here.
936	
937	LUCIUS	I will, my lord.
938	
939	[Exit]
940	
941	BRUTUS	It must be by his death: and for my part,
942	I know no personal cause to spurn at him,
943	But for the general. He would be crown'd:
944	How that might change his nature, there's the question.
945	It is the bright day that brings forth the adder;
946	And that craves wary walking. Crown him?--that;--
947	And then, I grant, we put a sting in him,
948	That at his will he may do danger with.
949	The abuse of greatness is, when it disjoins
950	Remorse from power: and, to speak truth of Caesar,
951	I have not known when his affections sway'd
952	More than his reason. But 'tis a common proof,
953	That lowliness is young ambition's ladder,
954	Whereto the climber-upward turns his face;
955	But when he once attains the upmost round.
956	He then unto the ladder turns his back,
957	Looks in the clouds, scorning the base degrees
958	By which he did ascend. So Caesar may.
959	Then, lest he may, prevent. And, since the quarrel
960	Will bear no colour for the thing he is,
961	Fashion it thus; that what he is, augmented,
962	Would run to these and these extremities:
963	And therefore think him as a serpent's egg
964	Which, hatch'd, would, as his kind, grow mischievous,
965	And kill him in the shell.
966	
967	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
968	
969	LUCIUS	The taper burneth in your closet, sir.
970	Searching the window for a flint, I found
971	This paper, thus seal'd up; and, I am sure,
972	It did not lie there when I went to bed.
973	
974	[Gives him the letter]
975	
976	BRUTUS	Get you to bed again; it is not day.
977	Is not to-morrow, boy, the ides of March?
978	
979	LUCIUS	I know not, sir.
980	
981	BRUTUS	Look in the calendar, and bring me word.
982	
983	LUCIUS	I will, sir.
984	
985	[Exit]
986	
987	BRUTUS	The exhalations whizzing in the air
988	Give so much light that I may read by them.
989	
990	[Opens the letter and reads]
991	
992	'Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake, and see thyself.
993	Shall Rome, &c. Speak, strike, redress!
994	Brutus, thou sleep'st: awake!'
995	Such instigations have been often dropp'd
996	Where I have took them up.
997	'Shall Rome, &c.' Thus must I piece it out:
998	Shall Rome stand under one man's awe? What, Rome?
999	My ancestors did from the streets of Rome
1000	The Tarquin drive, when he was call'd a king.
1001	'Speak, strike, redress!' Am I entreated
1002	To speak and strike? O Rome, I make thee promise:
1003	If the redress will follow, thou receivest
1004	Thy full petition at the hand of Brutus!
1005	
1006	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
1007	
1008	LUCIUS	Sir, March is wasted fourteen days.
1009	
1010	[Knocking within]
1011	
1012	BRUTUS	'Tis good. Go to the gate; somebody knocks.
1013	
1014	[Exit LUCIUS]
1015	
1016	Since Cassius first did whet me against Caesar,
1017	I have not slept.
1018	Between the acting of a dreadful thing
1019	And the first motion, all the interim is
1020	Like a phantasma, or a hideous dream:
1021	The Genius and the mortal instruments
1022	Are then in council; and the state of man,
1023	Like to a little kingdom, suffers then
1024	The nature of an insurrection.
1025	
1026	[Re-enter LUCIUS]
1027	
1028	LUCIUS	Sir, 'tis your brother Cassius at the door,
1029	Who doth desire to see you.
1030	
1031	BRUTUS	Is he alone?
1032	
1033	LUCIUS	No, sir, there are moe with him.
1034	
1035	BRUTUS	Do you know them?
1036	
1037	LUCIUS	No, sir; their hats are pluck'd about their ears,
1038	And half their faces buried in their cloaks,
1039	That by no means I may discover them
1040	By any mark of favour.
1041	
1042	BRUTUS	Let 'em enter.
1043	
1044	[Exit LUCIUS]
1045	
1046	They are the faction. O conspiracy,
1047	Shamest thou to show thy dangerous brow by night,
1048	When evils are most free? O, then by day
1049	Where wilt thou find a cavern dark enough
1050	To mask thy monstrous visage? Seek none, conspiracy;
1051	Hide it in smiles and affability:
1052	For if thou path, thy native semblance on,
1053	Not Erebus itself were dim enough
1054	To hide thee from prevention.
1055	
1056	[Enter the conspirators, CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS
1057	BRUTUS, CINNA, METELLUS CIMBER, and TREBONIUS]
1058	
1059	CASSIUS	I think we are too bold upon your rest:
1060	Good morrow, Brutus; do we trouble you?
1061	
1062	BRUTUS	I have been up this hour, awake all night.
1063	Know I these men that come along with you?
1064	
1065	CASSIUS	Yes, every man of them, and no man here
1066	But honours you; and every one doth wish
1067	You had but that opinion of yourself
1068	Which every noble Roman bears of you.
1069	This is Trebonius.
1070	
1071	BRUTUS	                  He is welcome hither.
1072	
1073	CASSIUS	This, Decius Brutus.
1074	
1075	BRUTUS	He is welcome too.
1076	
1077	CASSIUS	This, Casca; this, Cinna; and this, Metellus Cimber.
1078	
1079	BRUTUS	They are all welcome.
1080	What watchful cares do interpose themselves
1081	Betwixt your eyes and night?
1082	
1083	CASSIUS	Shall I entreat a word?
1084	
1085	[BRUTUS and CASSIUS whisper]
1086	
1087	DECIUS BRUTUS	Here lies the east: doth not the day break here?
1088	
1089	CASCA	No.
1090	
1091	CINNA	O, pardon, sir, it doth; and yon gray lines
1092	That fret the clouds are messengers of day.
1093	
1094	CASCA	You shall confess that you are both deceived.
1095	Here, as I point my sword, the sun arises,
1096	Which is a great way growing on the south,
1097	Weighing the youthful season of the year.
1098	Some two months hence up higher toward the north
1099	He first presents his fire; and the high east
1100	Stands, as the Capitol, directly here.
1101	
1102	BRUTUS	Give me your hands all over, one by one.
1103	
1104	CASSIUS	And let us swear our resolution.
1105	
1106	BRUTUS	No, not an oath: if not the face of men,
1107	The sufferance of our souls, the time's abuse,--
1108	If these be motives weak, break off betimes,
1109	And every man hence to his idle bed;
1110	So let high-sighted tyranny range on,
1111	Till each man drop by lottery. But if these,
1112	As I am sure they do, bear fire enough
1113	To kindle cowards and to steel with valour
1114	The melting spirits of women, then, countrymen,
1115	What need we any spur but our own cause,
1116	To prick us to redress? what other bond
1117	Than secret Romans, that have spoke the word,
1118	And will not palter? and what other oath
1119	Than honesty to honesty engaged,
1120	That this shall be, or we will fall for it?
1121	Swear priests and cowards and men cautelous,
1122	Old feeble carrions and such suffering souls
1123	That welcome wrongs; unto bad causes swear
1124	Such creatures as men doubt; but do not stain
1125	The even virtue of our enterprise,
1126	Nor the insuppressive mettle of our spirits,
1127	To think that or our cause or our performance
1128	Did need an oath; when every drop of blood
1129	That every Roman bears, and nobly bears,
1130	Is guilty of a several bastardy,
1131	If he do break the smallest particle
1132	Of any promise that hath pass'd from him.
1133	
1134	CASSIUS	But what of Cicero? shall we sound him?
1135	I think he will stand very strong with us.
1136	
1137	CASCA	Let us not leave him out.
1138	
1139	CINNA	No, by no means.
1140	
1141	METELLUS CIMBER	O, let us have him, for his silver hairs
1142	Will purchase us a good opinion
1143	And buy men's voices to commend our deeds:
1144	It shall be said, his judgment ruled our hands;
1145	Our youths and wildness shall no whit appear,
1146	But all be buried in his gravity.
1147	
1148	BRUTUS	O, name him not: let us not break with him;
1149	For he will never follow any thing
1150	That other men begin.
1151	
1152	CASSIUS	Then leave him out.
1153	
1154	CASCA	Indeed he is not fit.
1155	
1156	DECIUS BRUTUS	Shall no man else be touch'd but only Caesar?
1157	
1158	CASSIUS	Decius, well urged: I think it is not meet,
1159	Mark Antony, so well beloved of Caesar,
1160	Should outlive Caesar: we shall find of him
1161	A shrewd contriver; and, you know, his means,
1162	If he improve them, may well stretch so far
1163	As to annoy us all: which to prevent,
1164	Let Antony and Caesar fall together.
1165	
1166	BRUTUS	Our course will seem too bloody, Caius Cassius,
1167	To cut the head off and then hack the limbs,
1168	Like wrath in death and envy afterwards;
1169	For Antony is but a limb of Caesar:
1170	Let us be sacrificers, but not butchers, Caius.
1171	We all stand up against the spirit of Caesar;
1172	And in the spirit of men there is no blood:
1173	O, that we then could come by Caesar's spirit,
1174	And not dismember Caesar! But, alas,
1175	Caesar must bleed for it! And, gentle friends,
1176	Let's kill him boldly, but not wrathfully;
1177	Let's carve him as a dish fit for the gods,
1178	Not hew him as a carcass fit for hounds:
1179	And let our hearts, as subtle masters do,
1180	Stir up their servants to an act of rage,
1181	And after seem to chide 'em. This shall make
1182	Our purpose necessary and not envious:
1183	Which so appearing to the common eyes,
1184	We shall be call'd purgers, not murderers.
1185	And for Mark Antony, think not of him;
1186	For he can do no more than Caesar's arm
1187	When Caesar's head is off.
1188	
1189	CASSIUS	Yet I fear him;
1190	For in the ingrafted love he bears to Caesar--
1191	
1192	BRUTUS	Alas, good Cassius, do not think of him:
1193	If he love Caesar, all that he can do
1194	Is to himself, take thought and die for Caesar:
1195	And that were much he should; for he is given
1196	To sports, to wildness and much company.
1197	
1198	TREBONIUS	There is no fear in him; let him not die;
1199	For he will live, and laugh at this hereafter.
1200	
1201	[Clock strikes]
1202	
1203	BRUTUS	Peace! count the clock.
1204	
1205	CASSIUS	The clock hath stricken three.
1206	
1207	TREBONIUS	'Tis time to part.
1208	
1209	CASSIUS	                  But it is doubtful yet,
1210	Whether Caesar will come forth to-day, or no;
1211	For he is superstitious grown of late,
1212	Quite from the main opinion he held once
1213	Of fantasy, of dreams and ceremonies:
1214	It may be, these apparent prodigies,
1215	The unaccustom'd terror of this night,
1216	And the persuasion of his augurers,
1217	May hold him from the Capitol to-day.
1218	
1219	DECIUS BRUTUS	Never fear that: if he be so resolved,
1220	I can o'ersway him; for he loves to hear
1221	That unicorns may be betray'd with trees,
1222	And bears with glasses, elephants with holes,
1223	Lions with toils and men with flatterers;
1224	But when I tell him he hates flatterers,
1225	He says he does, being then most flattered.
1226	Let me work;
1227	For I can give his humour the true bent,
1228	And I will bring him to the Capitol.
1229	
1230	CASSIUS	Nay, we will all of us be there to fetch him.
1231	
1232	BRUTUS	By the eighth hour: is that the uttermost?
1233	
1234	CINNA	Be that the uttermost, and fail not then.
1235	
1236	METELLUS CIMBER	Caius Ligarius doth bear Caesar hard,
1237	Who rated him for speaking well of Pompey:
1238	I wonder none of you have thought of him.
1239	
1240	BRUTUS	Now, good Metellus, go along by him:
1241	He loves me well, and I have given him reasons;
1242	Send him but hither, and I'll fashion him.
1243	
1244	CASSIUS	The morning comes upon 's: we'll leave you, Brutus.
1245	And, friends, disperse yourselves; but all remember
1246	What you have said, and show yourselves true Romans.
1247	
1248	BRUTUS	Good gentlemen, look fresh and merrily;
1249	Let not our looks put on our purposes,
1250	But bear it as our Roman actors do,
1251	With untired spirits and formal constancy:
1252	And so good morrow to you every one.
1253	
1254	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
1255	
1256	Boy! Lucius! Fast asleep? It is no matter;
1257	Enjoy the honey-heavy dew of slumber:
1258	Thou hast no figures nor no fantasies,
1259	Which busy care draws in the brains of men;
1260	Therefore thou sleep'st so sound.
1261	
1262	[Enter PORTIA]
1263	
1264	PORTIA	Brutus, my lord!
1265	
1266	BRUTUS	Portia, what mean you? wherefore rise you now?
1267	It is not for your health thus to commit
1268	Your weak condition to the raw cold morning.
1269	
1270	PORTIA	Nor for yours neither. You've ungently, Brutus,
1271	Stole from my bed: and yesternight, at supper,
1272	You suddenly arose, and walk'd about,
1273	Musing and sighing, with your arms across,
1274	And when I ask'd you what the matter was,
1275	You stared upon me with ungentle looks;
1276	I urged you further; then you scratch'd your head,
1277	And too impatiently stamp'd with your foot;
1278	Yet I insisted, yet you answer'd not,
1279	But, with an angry wafture of your hand,
1280	Gave sign for me to leave you: so I did;
1281	Fearing to strengthen that impatience
1282	Which seem'd too much enkindled, and withal
1283	Hoping it was but an effect of humour,
1284	Which sometime hath his hour with every man.
1285	It will not let you eat, nor talk, nor sleep,
1286	And could it work so much upon your shape
1287	As it hath much prevail'd on your condition,
1288	I should not know you, Brutus. Dear my lord,
1289	Make me acquainted with your cause of grief.
1290	
1291	BRUTUS	I am not well in health, and that is all.
1292	
1293	PORTIA	Brutus is wise, and, were he not in health,
1294	He would embrace the means to come by it.
1295	
1296	BRUTUS	Why, so I do. Good Portia, go to bed.
1297	
1298	PORTIA	Is Brutus sick? and is it physical
1299	To walk unbraced and suck up the humours
1300	Of the dank morning? What, is Brutus sick,
1301	And will he steal out of his wholesome bed,
1302	To dare the vile contagion of the night
1303	And tempt the rheumy and unpurged air
1304	To add unto his sickness? No, my Brutus;
1305	You have some sick offence within your mind,
1306	Which, by the right and virtue of my place,
1307	I ought to know of: and, upon my knees,
1308	I charm you, by my once-commended beauty,
1309	By all your vows of love and that great vow
1310	Which did incorporate and make us one,
1311	That you unfold to me, yourself, your half,
1312	Why you are heavy, and what men to-night
1313	Have had to resort to you: for here have been
1314	Some six or seven, who did hide their faces
1315	Even from darkness.
1316	
1317	BRUTUS	Kneel not, gentle Portia.
1318	
1319	PORTIA	I should not need, if you were gentle Brutus.
1320	Within the bond of marriage, tell me, Brutus,
1321	Is it excepted I should know no secrets
1322	That appertain to you? Am I yourself
1323	But, as it were, in sort or limitation,
1324	To keep with you at meals, comfort your bed,
1325	And talk to you sometimes? Dwell I but in the suburbs
1326	Of your good pleasure? If it be no more,
1327	Portia is Brutus' harlot, not his wife.
1328	
1329	BRUTUS	You are my true and honourable wife,
1330	As dear to me as are the ruddy drops
1331	That visit my sad heart
1332	
1333	PORTIA	If this were true, then should I know this secret.
1334	I grant I am a woman; but withal
1335	A woman that Lord Brutus took to wife:
1336	I grant I am a woman; but withal
1337	A woman well-reputed, Cato's daughter.
1338	Think you I am no stronger than my sex,
1339	Being so father'd and so husbanded?
1340	Tell me your counsels, I will not disclose 'em:
1341	I have made strong proof of my constancy,
1342	Giving myself a voluntary wound
1343	Here, in the thigh: can I bear that with patience.
1344	And not my husband's secrets?
1345	
1346	BRUTUS	O ye gods,
1347	
1348	Render me worthy of this noble wife!
1349	
1350	[Knocking within]
1351	
1352	Hark, hark! one knocks: Portia, go in awhile;
1353	And by and by thy bosom shall partake
1354	The secrets of my heart.
1355	All my engagements I will construe to thee,
1356	All the charactery of my sad brows:
1357	Leave me with haste.
1358	
1359	[Exit PORTIA]
1360	
1361	Lucius, who's that knocks?
1362	
1363	[Re-enter LUCIUS with LIGARIUS]
1364	
1365	LUCIUS	He is a sick man that would speak with you.
1366	
1367	BRUTUS	Caius Ligarius, that Metellus spake of.
1368	Boy, stand aside. Caius Ligarius! how?
1369	
1370	LIGARIUS	Vouchsafe good morrow from a feeble tongue.
1371	
1372	BRUTUS	O, what a time have you chose out, brave Caius,
1373	To wear a kerchief! Would you were not sick!
1374	
1375	LIGARIUS	I am not sick, if Brutus have in hand
1376	Any exploit worthy the name of honour.
1377	
1378	BRUTUS	Such an exploit have I in hand, Ligarius,
1379	Had you a healthful ear to hear of it.
1380	
1381	LIGARIUS	By all the gods that Romans bow before,
1382	I here discard my sickness! Soul of Rome!
1383	Brave son, derived from honourable loins!
1384	Thou, like an exorcist, hast conjured up
1385	My mortified spirit. Now bid me run,
1386	And I will strive with things impossible;
1387	Yea, get the better of them. What's to do?
1388	
1389	BRUTUS	A piece of work that will make sick men whole.
1390	
1391	LIGARIUS	But are not some whole that we must make sick?
1392	
1393	BRUTUS	That must we also. What it is, my Caius,
1394	I shall unfold to thee, as we are going
1395	To whom it must be done.
1396	
1397	LIGARIUS	Set on your foot,
1398	And with a heart new-fired I follow you,
1399	To do I know not what: but it sufficeth
1400	That Brutus leads me on.
1401	
1402	BRUTUS	Follow me, then.

1412	ACT II
1413	
1414	
1415	
1416	SCENE II	CAESAR's house.
1417	
1418	
1419	[Thunder and lightning. Enter CAESAR, in his
1420	night-gown]
1421	
1422	CAESAR	Nor heaven nor earth have been at peace to-night:
1423	Thrice hath Calpurnia in her sleep cried out,
1424	'Help, ho! they murder Caesar!' Who's within?
1425	
1426	[Enter a Servant]
1427	
1428	Servant	My lord?
1429	
1430	CAESAR	Go bid the priests do present sacrifice
1431	And bring me their opinions of success.
1432	
1433	Servant	I will, my lord.
1434	
1435	[Exit]
1436	
1437	[Enter CALPURNIA]
1438	
1439	CALPURNIA	What mean you, Caesar? think you to walk forth?
1440	You shall not stir out of your house to-day.
1441	
1442	CAESAR	Caesar shall forth: the things that threaten'd me
1443	Ne'er look'd but on my back; when they shall see
1444	The face of Caesar, they are vanished.
1445	
1446	CALPURNIA	Caesar, I never stood on ceremonies,
1447	Yet now they fright me. There is one within,
1448	Besides the things that we have heard and seen,
1449	Recounts most horrid sights seen by the watch.
1450	A lioness hath whelped in the streets;
1451	And graves have yawn'd, and yielded up their dead;
1452	Fierce fiery warriors fought upon the clouds,
1453	In ranks and squadrons and right form of war,
1454	Which drizzled blood upon the Capitol;
1455	The noise of battle hurtled in the air,
1456	Horses did neigh, and dying men did groan,
1457	And ghosts did shriek and squeal about the streets.
1458	O Caesar! these things are beyond all use,
1459	And I do fear them.
1460	
1461	CAESAR	What can be avoided
1462	Whose end is purposed by the mighty gods?
1463	Yet Caesar shall go forth; for these predictions
1464	Are to the world in general as to Caesar.
1465	
1466	CALPURNIA	When beggars die, there are no comets seen;
1467	The heavens themselves blaze forth the death of princes.
1468	
1469	CAESAR	Cowards die many times before their deaths;
1470	The valiant never taste of death but once.
1471	Of all the wonders that I yet have heard.
1472	It seems to me most strange that men should fear;
1473	Seeing that death, a necessary end,
1474	Will come when it will come.
1475	
1476	[Re-enter Servant]
1477	
1478	What say the augurers?
1479	
1480	Servant	They would not have you to stir forth to-day.
1481	Plucking the entrails of an offering forth,
1482	They could not find a heart within the beast.
1483	
1484	CAESAR	The gods do this in shame of cowardice:
1485	Caesar should be a beast without a heart,
1486	If he should stay at home to-day for fear.
1487	No, Caesar shall not: danger knows full well
1488	That Caesar is more dangerous than he:
1489	We are two lions litter'd in one day,
1490	And I the elder and more terrible:
1491	And Caesar shall go forth.
1492	
1493	CALPURNIA	Alas, my lord,
1494	Your wisdom is consumed in confidence.
1495	Do not go forth to-day: call it my fear
1496	That keeps you in the house, and not your own.
1497	We'll send Mark Antony to the senate-house:
1498	And he shall say you are not well to-day:
1499	Let me, upon my knee, prevail in this.
1500	
1501	CAESAR	Mark Antony shall say I am not well,
1502	And, for thy humour, I will stay at home.
1503	
1504	[Enter DECIUS BRUTUS]
1505	
1506	Here's Decius Brutus, he shall tell them so.
1507	
1508	DECIUS BRUTUS	Caesar, all hail! good morrow, worthy Caesar:
1509	I come to fetch you to the senate-house.
1510	
1511	CAESAR	And you are come in very happy time,
1512	To bear my greeting to the senators
1513	And tell them that I will not come to-day:
1514	Cannot, is false, and that I dare not, falser:
1515	I will not come to-day: tell them so, Decius.
1516	
1517	CALPURNIA	Say he is sick.
1518	
1519	CAESAR	                  Shall Caesar send a lie?
1520	Have I in conquest stretch'd mine arm so far,
1521	To be afraid to tell graybeards the truth?
1522	Decius, go tell them Caesar will not come.
1523	
1524	DECIUS BRUTUS	Most mighty Caesar, let me know some cause,
1525	Lest I be laugh'd at when I tell them so.
1526	
1527	CAESAR	The cause is in my will: I will not come;
1528	That is enough to satisfy the senate.
1529	But for your private satisfaction,
1530	Because I love you, I will let you know:
1531	Calpurnia here, my wife, stays me at home:
1532	She dreamt to-night she saw my statua,
1533	Which, like a fountain with an hundred spouts,
1534	Did run pure blood: and many lusty Romans
1535	Came smiling, and did bathe their hands in it:
1536	And these does she apply for warnings, and portents,
1537	And evils imminent; and on her knee
1538	Hath begg'd that I will stay at home to-day.
1539	
1540	DECIUS BRUTUS	This dream is all amiss interpreted;
1541	It was a vision fair and fortunate:
1542	Your statue spouting blood in many pipes,
1543	In which so many smiling Romans bathed,
1544	Signifies that from you great Rome shall suck
1545	Reviving blood, and that great men shall press
1546	For tinctures, stains, relics and cognizance.
1547	This by Calpurnia's dream is signified.
1548	
1549	CAESAR	And this way have you well expounded it.
1550	
1551	DECIUS BRUTUS	I have, when you have heard what I can say:
1552	And know it now: the senate have concluded
1553	To give this day a crown to mighty Caesar.
1554	If you shall send them word you will not come,
1555	Their minds may change. Besides, it were a mock
1556	Apt to be render'd, for some one to say
1557	'Break up the senate till another time,
1558	When Caesar's wife shall meet with better dreams.'
1559	If Caesar hide himself, shall they not whisper
1560	'Lo, Caesar is afraid'?
1561	Pardon me, Caesar; for my dear dear love
1562	To our proceeding bids me tell you this;
1563	And reason to my love is liable.
1564	
1565	CAESAR	How foolish do your fears seem now, Calpurnia!
1566	I am ashamed I did yield to them.
1567	Give me my robe, for I will go.
1568	
1569	[Enter PUBLIUS, BRUTUS, LIGARIUS, METELLUS, CASCA,
1570	TREBONIUS, and CINNA]
1571	
1572	And look where Publius is come to fetch me.
1573	
1574	PUBLIUS	Good morrow, Caesar.
1575	
1576	CAESAR	Welcome, Publius.
1577	What, Brutus, are you stirr'd so early too?
1578	Good morrow, Casca. Caius Ligarius,
1579	Caesar was ne'er so much your enemy
1580	As that same ague which hath made you lean.
1581	What is 't o'clock?
1582	
1583	BRUTUS	Caesar, 'tis strucken eight.
1584	
1585	CAESAR	I thank you for your pains and courtesy.
1586	
1587	[Enter ANTONY]
1588	
1589	See! Antony, that revels long o' nights,
1590	Is notwithstanding up. Good morrow, Antony.
1591	
1592	ANTONY	So to most noble Caesar.
1593	
1594	CAESAR	Bid them prepare within:
1595	I am to blame to be thus waited for.
1596	Now, Cinna: now, Metellus: what, Trebonius!
1597	I have an hour's talk in store for you;
1598	Remember that you call on me to-day:
1599	Be near me, that I may remember you.
1600	
1601	TREBONIUS	Caesar, I will:
1602	
1603	[Aside]
1604	
1605	and so near will I be,
1606	That your best friends shall wish I had been further.
1607	
1608	CAESAR	Good friends, go in, and taste some wine with me;
1609	And we, like friends, will straightway go together.
1610	
1611	BRUTUS	[Aside]  That every like is not the same, O Caesar,
1612	The heart of Brutus yearns to think upon!

1627	
1628	
1629	[Enter ARTEMIDORUS, reading a paper]
1630	
1631	ARTEMIDORUS	'Caesar, beware of Brutus; take heed of Cassius;
1632	come not near Casca; have an eye to Cinna, trust not
1633	Trebonius: mark well Metellus Cimber: Decius Brutus
1634	loves thee not: thou hast wronged Caius Ligarius.
1635	There is but one mind in all these men, and it is
1636	bent against Caesar. If thou beest not immortal,
1637	look about you: security gives way to conspiracy.
1638	The mighty gods defend thee! Thy lover,
1639	'ARTEMIDORUS.'
1640	Here will I stand till Caesar pass along,
1641	And as a suitor will I give him this.
1642	My heart laments that virtue cannot live
1643	Out of the teeth of emulation.
1644	If thou read this, O Caesar, thou mayst live;
1645	If not, the Fates with traitors do contrive.

1652	JULIUS CAESAR
1653	
1654	
1655	ACT II
1656	
1657	
1658	
1659	SCENE IV	Another part of the same street, before the house of BRUTUS.
1660	
1661	
1662	[Enter PORTIA and LUCIUS]
1663	
1664	PORTIA	I prithee, boy, run to the senate-house;
1665	Stay not to answer me, but get thee gone:
1666	Why dost thou stay?
1667	
1668	LUCIUS	To know my errand, madam.
1669	
1670	PORTIA	I would have had thee there, and here again,
1671	Ere I can tell thee what thou shouldst do there.
1672	O constancy, be strong upon my side,
1673	Set a huge mountain 'tween my heart and tongue!
1674	I have a man's mind, but a woman's might.
1675	How hard it is for women to keep counsel!
1676	Art thou here yet?
1677	
1678	LUCIUS	                  Madam, what should I do?
1679	Run to the Capitol, and nothing else?
1680	And so return to you, and nothing else?
1681	
1682	PORTIA	Yes, bring me word, boy, if thy lord look well,
1683	For he went sickly forth: and take good note
1684	What Caesar doth, what suitors press to him.
1685	Hark, boy! what noise is that?
1686	
1687	LUCIUS	I hear none, madam.
1688	
1689	PORTIA	Prithee, listen well;
1690	I heard a bustling rumour, like a fray,
1691	And the wind brings it from the Capitol.
1692	
1693	LUCIUS	Sooth, madam, I hear nothing.
1694	
1695	[Enter the Soothsayer]
1696	
1697	PORTIA	Come hither, fellow: which way hast thou been?
1698	
1699	Soothsayer	At mine own house, good lady.
1700	
1701	PORTIA	What is't o'clock?
1702	
1703	Soothsayer	                  About the ninth hour, lady.
1704	
1705	PORTIA	Is Caesar yet gone to the Capitol?
1706	
1707	Soothsayer	Madam, not yet: I go to take my stand,
1708	To see him pass on to the Capitol.
1709	
1710	PORTIA	Thou hast some suit to Caesar, hast thou not?
1711	
1712	Soothsayer	That I have, lady: if it will please Caesar
1713	To be so good to Caesar as to hear me,
1714	I shall beseech him to befriend himself.
1715	
1716	PORTIA	Why, know'st thou any harm's intended towards him?
1717	
1718	Soothsayer	None that I know will be, much that I fear may chance.
1719	Good morrow to you. Here the street is narrow:
1720	The throng that follows Caesar at the heels,
1721	Of senators, of praetors, common suitors,
1722	Will crowd a feeble man almost to death:
1723	I'll get me to a place more void, and there
1724	Speak to great Caesar as he comes along.
1725	
1726	[Exit]
1727	
1728	PORTIA	I must go in. Ay me, how weak a thing
1729	The heart of woman is! O Brutus,
1730	The heavens speed thee in thine enterprise!
1731	Sure, the boy heard me: Brutus hath a suit
1732	That Caesar will not grant. O, I grow faint.
1733	Run, Lucius, and commend me to my lord;
1734	Say I am merry: come to me again,
1735	And bring me word what he doth say to thee.
1736	
1737	[Exeunt severally]

1743	
1744	
1745	ACT III
1746	
1747	
1748	
1749	SCENE I	Rome. Before the Capitol; the Senate sitting above.
1750	
1751	
1752	[A crowd of people; among them ARTEMIDORUS and the
1753	Soothsayer. Flourish. Enter CAESAR, BRUTUS,
1754	CASSIUS, CASCA, DECIUS BRUTUS, METELLUS CIMBER,
1755	TREBONIUS, CINNA, ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POPILIUS,
1756	PUBLIUS, and others]
1757	
1758	CAESAR	[To the Soothsayer]  The ides of March are come.
1759	
1760	Soothsayer	Ay, Caesar; but not gone.
1761	
1762	ARTEMIDORUS	Hail, Caesar! read this schedule.
1763	
1764	DECIUS BRUTUS	Trebonius doth desire you to o'erread,
1765	At your best leisure, this his humble suit.
1766	
1767	ARTEMIDORUS	O Caesar, read mine first; for mine's a suit
1768	That touches Caesar nearer: read it, great Caesar.
1769	
1770	CAESAR	What touches us ourself shall be last served.
1771	
1772	ARTEMIDORUS	Delay not, Caesar; read it instantly.
1773	
1774	CAESAR	What, is the fellow mad?
1775	
1776	PUBLIUS	Sirrah, give place.
1777	
1778	CASSIUS	What, urge you your petitions in the street?
1779	Come to the Capitol.
1780	
1781	[CAESAR goes up to the Senate-House, the rest
1782	following]
1783	
1784	POPILIUS	I wish your enterprise to-day may thrive.
1785	
1786	CASSIUS	What enterprise, Popilius?
1787	
1788	POPILIUS	Fare you well.
1789	
1790	[Advances to CAESAR]
1791	
1792	BRUTUS	What said Popilius Lena?
1793	
1794	CASSIUS	He wish'd to-day our enterprise might thrive.
1795	I fear our purpose is discovered.
1796	
1797	BRUTUS	Look, how he makes to Caesar; mark him.
1798	
1799	CASSIUS	Casca, be sudden, for we fear prevention.
1800	Brutus, what shall be done? If this be known,
1801	Cassius or Caesar never shall turn back,
1802	For I will slay myself.
1803	
1804	BRUTUS	Cassius, be constant:
1805	Popilius Lena speaks not of our purposes;
1806	For, look, he smiles, and Caesar doth not change.
1807	
1808	CASSIUS	Trebonius knows his time; for, look you, Brutus.
1809	He draws Mark Antony out of the way.
1810	
1811	[Exeunt ANTONY and TREBONIUS]
1812	
1813	DECIUS BRUTUS	Where is Metellus Cimber? Let him go,
1814	And presently prefer his suit to Caesar.
1815	
1816	BRUTUS	He is address'd: press near and second him.
1817	
1818	CINNA	Casca, you are the first that rears your hand.
1819	
1820	CAESAR	Are we all ready? What is now amiss
1821	That Caesar and his senate must redress?
1822	
1823	METELLUS CIMBER	Most high, most mighty, and most puissant Caesar,
1824	Metellus Cimber throws before thy seat
1825	An humble heart,--
1826	
1827	[Kneeling]
1828	
1829	CAESAR	                  I must prevent thee, Cimber.
1830	These couchings and these lowly courtesies
1831	Might fire the blood of ordinary men,
1832	And turn pre-ordinance and first decree
1833	Into the law of children. Be not fond,
1834	To think that Caesar bears such rebel blood
1835	That will be thaw'd from the true quality
1836	With that which melteth fools; I mean, sweet words,
1837	Low-crooked court'sies and base spaniel-fawning.
1838	Thy brother by decree is banished:
1839	If thou dost bend and pray and fawn for him,
1840	I spurn thee like a cur out of my way.
1841	Know, Caesar doth not wrong, nor without cause
1842	Will he be satisfied.
1843	
1844	METELLUS CIMBER	Is there no voice more worthy than my own
1845	To sound more sweetly in great Caesar's ear
1846	For the repealing of my banish'd brother?
1847	
1848	BRUTUS	I kiss thy hand, but not in flattery, Caesar;
1849	Desiring thee that Publius Cimber may
1850	Have an immediate freedom of repeal.
1851	
1852	CAESAR	What, Brutus!
1853	
1854	CASSIUS	                  Pardon, Caesar; Caesar, pardon:
1855	As low as to thy foot doth Cassius fall,
1856	To beg enfranchisement for Publius Cimber.
1857	
1858	CASSIUS	I could be well moved, if I were as you:
1859	If I could pray to move, prayers would move me:
1860	But I am constant as the northern star,
1861	Of whose true-fix'd and resting quality
1862	There is no fellow in the firmament.
1863	The skies are painted with unnumber'd sparks,
1864	They are all fire and every one doth shine,
1865	But there's but one in all doth hold his place:
1866	So in the world; 'tis furnish'd well with men,
1867	And men are flesh and blood, and apprehensive;
1868	Yet in the number I do know but one
1869	That unassailable holds on his rank,
1870	Unshaked of motion: and that I am he,
1871	Let me a little show it, even in this;
1872	That I was constant Cimber should be banish'd,
1873	And constant do remain to keep him so.
1874	
1875	CINNA	O Caesar,--
1876	
1877	CAESAR	          Hence! wilt thou lift up Olympus?
1878	
1879	DECIUS BRUTUS	Great Caesar,--
1880	
1881	CAESAR	                  Doth not Brutus bootless kneel?
1882	
1883	CASCA	Speak, hands for me!
1884	
1885	[CASCA first, then the other Conspirators and
1886	BRUTUS stab CAESAR]
1887	
1888	CAESAR	Et tu, Brute! Then fall, Caesar.
1889	
1890	[Dies]
1891	
1892	CINNA	Liberty! Freedom! Tyranny is dead!
1893	Run hence, proclaim, cry it about the streets.
1894	
1895	CASSIUS	Some to the common pulpits, and cry out
1896	'Liberty, freedom, and enfranchisement!'
1897	
1898	BRUTUS	People and senators, be not affrighted;
1899	Fly not; stand stiff: ambition's debt is paid.
1900	
1901	CASCA	Go to the pulpit, Brutus.
1902	
1903	DECIUS BRUTUS	And Cassius too.
1904	
1905	BRUTUS	Where's Publius?
1906	
1907	CINNA	Here, quite confounded with this mutiny.
1908	
1909	METELLUS CIMBER	Stand fast together, lest some friend of Caesar's
1910	Should chance--
1911	
1912	BRUTUS	Talk not of standing. Publius, good cheer;
1913	There is no harm intended to your person,
1914	Nor to no Roman else: so tell them, Publius.
1915	
1916	CASSIUS	And leave us, Publius; lest that the people,
1917	Rushing on us, should do your age some mischief.
1918	
1919	BRUTUS	Do so: and let no man abide this deed,
1920	But we the doers.
1921	
1922	[Re-enter TREBONIUS]
1923	
1924	CASSIUS	                  Where is Antony?
1925	
1926	TREBONIUS	Fled to his house amazed:
1927	Men, wives and children stare, cry out and run
1928	As it were doomsday.
1929	
1930	BRUTUS	Fates, we will know your pleasures:
1931	That we shall die, we know; 'tis but the time
1932	And drawing days out, that men stand upon.
1933	
1934	CASSIUS	Why, he that cuts off twenty years of life
1935	Cuts off so many years of fearing death.
1936	
1937	BRUTUS	Grant that, and then is death a benefit:
1938	So are we Caesar's friends, that have abridged
1939	His time of fearing death. Stoop, Romans, stoop,
1940	And let us bathe our hands in Caesar's blood
1941	Up to the elbows, and besmear our swords:
1942	Then walk we forth, even to the market-place,
1943	And, waving our red weapons o'er our heads,
1944	Let's all cry 'Peace, freedom and liberty!'
1945	
1946	CASSIUS	Stoop, then, and wash. How many ages hence
1947	Shall this our lofty scene be acted over
1948	In states unborn and accents yet unknown!
1949	
1950	BRUTUS	How many times shall Caesar bleed in sport,
1951	That now on Pompey's basis lies along
1952	No worthier than the dust!
1953	
1954	CASSIUS	So oft as that shall be,
1955	So often shall the knot of us be call'd
1956	The men that gave their country liberty.
1957	
1958	DECIUS BRUTUS	What, shall we forth?
1959	
1960	CASSIUS	Ay, every man away:
1961	Brutus shall lead; and we will grace his heels
1962	With the most boldest and best hearts of Rome.
1963	
1964	[Enter a Servant]
1965	
1966	BRUTUS	Soft! who comes here? A friend of Antony's.
1967	
1968	Servant	Thus, Brutus, did my master bid me kneel:
1969	Thus did Mark Antony bid me fall down;
1970	And, being prostrate, thus he bade me say:
1971	Brutus is noble, wise, valiant, and honest;
1972	Caesar was mighty, bold, royal, and loving:
1973	Say I love Brutus, and I honour him;
1974	Say I fear'd Caesar, honour'd him and loved him.
1975	If Brutus will vouchsafe that Antony
1976	May safely come to him, and be resolved
1977	How Caesar hath deserved to lie in death,
1978	Mark Antony shall not love Caesar dead
1979	So well as Brutus living; but will follow
1980	The fortunes and affairs of noble Brutus
1981	Thorough the hazards of this untrod state
1982	With all true faith. So says my master Antony.
1983	
1984	BRUTUS	Thy master is a wise and valiant Roman;
1985	I never thought him worse.
1986	Tell him, so please him come unto this place,
1987	He shall be satisfied; and, by my honour,
1988	Depart untouch'd.
1989	
1990	Servant	                  I'll fetch him presently.
1991	
1992	[Exit]
1993	
1994	BRUTUS	I know that we shall have him well to friend.
1995	
1996	CASSIUS	I wish we may: but yet have I a mind
1997	That fears him much; and my misgiving still
1998	Falls shrewdly to the purpose.
1999	
2000	BRUTUS	But here comes Antony.
2001	
2002	[Re-enter ANTONY]
2003	
2004	Welcome, Mark Antony.
2005	
2006	ANTONY	O mighty Caesar! dost thou lie so low?
2007	Are all thy conquests, glories, triumphs, spoils,
2008	Shrunk to this little measure? Fare thee well.
2009	I know not, gentlemen, what you intend,
2010	Who else must be let blood, who else is rank:
2011	If I myself, there is no hour so fit
2012	As Caesar's death hour, nor no instrument
2013	Of half that worth as those your swords, made rich
2014	With the most noble blood of all this world.
2015	I do beseech ye, if you bear me hard,
2016	Now, whilst your purpled hands do reek and smoke,
2017	Fulfil your pleasure. Live a thousand years,
2018	I shall not find myself so apt to die:
2019	No place will please me so, no mean of death,
2020	As here by Caesar, and by you cut off,
2021	The choice and master spirits of this age.
2022	
2023	BRUTUS	O Antony, beg not your death of us.
2024	Though now we must appear bloody and cruel,
2025	As, by our hands and this our present act,
2026	You see we do, yet see you but our hands
2027	And this the bleeding business they have done:
2028	Our hearts you see not; they are pitiful;
2029	And pity to the general wrong of Rome--
2030	As fire drives out fire, so pity pity--
2031	Hath done this deed on Caesar. For your part,
2032	To you our swords have leaden points, Mark Antony:
2033	Our arms, in strength of malice, and our hearts
2034	Of brothers' temper, do receive you in
2035	With all kind love, good thoughts, and reverence.
2036	
2037	CASSIUS	Your voice shall be as strong as any man's
2038	In the disposing of new dignities.
2039	
2040	BRUTUS	Only be patient till we have appeased
2041	The multitude, beside themselves with fear,
2042	And then we will deliver you the cause,
2043	Why I, that did love Caesar when I struck him,
2044	Have thus proceeded.
2045	
2046	ANTONY	I doubt not of your wisdom.
2047	Let each man render me his bloody hand:
2048	First, Marcus Brutus, will I shake with you;
2049	Next, Caius Cassius, do I take your hand;
2050	Now, Decius Brutus, yours: now yours, Metellus;
2051	Yours, Cinna; and, my valiant Casca, yours;
2052	Though last, not last in love, yours, good Trebonius.
2053	Gentlemen all,--alas, what shall I say?
2054	My credit now stands on such slippery ground,
2055	That one of two bad ways you must conceit me,
2056	Either a coward or a flatterer.
2057	That I did love thee, Caesar, O, 'tis true:
2058	If then thy spirit look upon us now,
2059	Shall it not grieve thee dearer than thy death,
2060	To see thy thy Anthony making his peace,
2061	Shaking the bloody fingers of thy foes,
2062	Most noble! in the presence of thy corse?
2063	Had I as many eyes as thou hast wounds,
2064	Weeping as fast as they stream forth thy blood,
2065	It would become me better than to close
2066	In terms of friendship with thine enemies.
2067	Pardon me, Julius! Here wast thou bay'd, brave hart;
2068	Here didst thou fall; and here thy hunters stand,
2069	Sign'd in thy spoil, and crimson'd in thy lethe.
2070	O world, thou wast the forest to this hart;
2071	And this, indeed, O world, the heart of thee.
2072	How like a deer, strucken by many princes,
2073	Dost thou here lie!
2074	
2075	CASSIUS	Mark Antony,--
2076	
2077	ANTONY	                  Pardon me, Caius Cassius:
2078	The enemies of Caesar shall say this;
2079	Then, in a friend, it is cold modesty.
2080	
2081	CASSIUS	I blame you not for praising Caesar so;
2082	But what compact mean you to have with us?
2083	Will you be prick'd in number of our friends;
2084	Or shall we on, and not depend on you?
2085	
2086	ANTONY	Therefore I took your hands, but was, indeed,
2087	Sway'd from the point, by looking down on Caesar.
2088	Friends am I with you all and love you all,
2089	Upon this hope, that you shall give me reasons
2090	Why and wherein Caesar was dangerous.
2091	
2092	BRUTUS	Or else were this a savage spectacle:
2093	Our reasons are so full of good regard
2094	That were you, Antony, the son of Caesar,
2095	You should be satisfied.
2096	
2097	ANTONY	That's all I seek:
2098	And am moreover suitor that I may
2099	Produce his body to the market-place;
2100	And in the pulpit, as becomes a friend,
2101	Speak in the order of his funeral.
2102	
2103	BRUTUS	You shall, Mark Antony.
2104	
2105	CASSIUS	Brutus, a word with you.
2106	
2107	[Aside to BRUTUS]
2108	
2109	You know not what you do: do not consent
2110	That Antony speak in his funeral:
2111	Know you how much the people may be moved
2112	By that which he will utter?
2113	
2114	BRUTUS	By your pardon;
2115	I will myself into the pulpit first,
2116	And show the reason of our Caesar's death:
2117	What Antony shall speak, I will protest
2118	He speaks by leave and by permission,
2119	And that we are contented Caesar shall
2120	Have all true rites and lawful ceremonies.
2121	It shall advantage more than do us wrong.
2122	
2123	CASSIUS	I know not what may fall; I like it not.
2124	
2125	BRUTUS	Mark Antony, here, take you Caesar's body.
2126	You shall not in your funeral speech blame us,
2127	But speak all good you can devise of Caesar,
2128	And say you do't by our permission;
2129	Else shall you not have any hand at all
2130	About his funeral: and you shall speak
2131	In the same pulpit whereto I am going,
2132	After my speech is ended.
2133	
2134	ANTONY	Be it so.
2135	I do desire no more.
2136	
2137	BRUTUS	Prepare the body then, and follow us.
2138	
2139	[Exeunt all but ANTONY]
2140	
2141	ANTONY	O, pardon me, thou bleeding piece of earth,
2142	That I am meek and gentle with these butchers!
2143	Thou art the ruins of the noblest man
2144	That ever lived in the tide of times.
2145	Woe to the hand that shed this costly blood!
2146	Over thy wounds now do I prophesy,--
2147	Which, like dumb mouths, do ope their ruby lips,
2148	To beg the voice and utterance of my tongue--
2149	A curse shall light upon the limbs of men;
2150	Domestic fury and fierce civil strife
2151	Shall cumber all the parts of Italy;
2152	Blood and destruction shall be so in use
2153	And dreadful objects so familiar
2154	That mothers shall but smile when they behold
2155	Their infants quarter'd with the hands of war;
2156	All pity choked with custom of fell deeds:
2157	And Caesar's spirit, ranging for revenge,
2158	With Ate by his side come hot from hell,
2159	Shall in these confines with a monarch's voice
2160	Cry  'Havoc,' and let slip the dogs of war;
2161	That this foul deed shall smell above the earth
2162	With carrion men, groaning for burial.
2163	
2164	[Enter a Servant]
2165	
2166	You serve Octavius Caesar, do you not?
2167	
2168	Servant	I do, Mark Antony.
2169	
2170	ANTONY	Caesar did write for him to come to Rome.
2171	
2172	Servant	He did receive his letters, and is coming;
2173	And bid me say to you by word of mouth--
2174	O Caesar!--
2175	
2176	[Seeing the body]
2177	
2178	ANTONY	Thy heart is big, get thee apart and weep.
2179	Passion, I see, is catching; for mine eyes,
2180	Seeing those beads of sorrow stand in thine,
2181	Began to water. Is thy master coming?
2182	
2183	Servant	He lies to-night within seven leagues of Rome.
2184	
2185	ANTONY	Post back with speed, and tell him what hath chanced:
2186	Here is a mourning Rome, a dangerous Rome,
2187	No Rome of safety for Octavius yet;
2188	Hie hence, and tell him so. Yet, stay awhile;
2189	Thou shalt not back till I have borne this corse
2190	Into the market-place: there shall I try
2191	In my oration, how the people take
2192	The cruel issue of these bloody men;
2193	According to the which, thou shalt discourse
2194	To young Octavius of the state of things.
2195	Lend me your hand.
2196	
2197	[Exeunt with CAESAR's body]

2202	JULIUS CAESAR
2203	
2204	
2205	ACT III
2206	
2207	
2208	
2209	SCENE II	The Forum.
2210	
2211	
2212	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS, and a throng of Citizens]
2213	
2214	Citizens	We will be satisfied; let us be satisfied.
2215	
2216	BRUTUS	Then follow me, and give me audience, friends.
2217	Cassius, go you into the other street,
2218	And part the numbers.
2219	Those that will hear me speak, let 'em stay here;
2220	Those that will follow Cassius, go with him;
2221	And public reasons shall be rendered
2222	Of Caesar's death.
2223	
2224	First Citizen	                  I will hear Brutus speak.
2225	
2226	Second Citizen	I will hear Cassius; and compare their reasons,
2227	When severally we hear them rendered.
2228	
2229	[Exit CASSIUS, with some of the Citizens. BRUTUS
2230	goes into the pulpit]
2231	
2232	Third Citizen	The noble Brutus is ascended: silence!
2233	
2234	BRUTUS	Be patient till the last.
2235	
2236	Romans, countrymen, and lovers! hear me for my
2237	cause, and be silent, that you may hear: believe me
2238	for mine honour, and have respect to mine honour, that
2239	you may believe: censure me in your wisdom, and
2240	awake your senses, that you may the better judge.
2241	If there be any in this assembly, any dear friend of
2242	Caesar's, to him I say, that Brutus' love to Caesar
2243	was no less than his. If then that friend demand
2244	why Brutus rose against Caesar, this is my answer:
2245	--Not that I loved Caesar less, but that I loved
2246	Rome more. Had you rather Caesar were living and
2247	die all slaves, than that Caesar were dead, to live
2248	all free men? As Caesar loved me, I weep for him;
2249	as he was fortunate, I rejoice at it; as he was
2250	valiant, I honour him: but, as he was ambitious, I
2251	slew him. There is tears for his love; joy for his
2252	fortune; honour for his valour; and death for his
2253	ambition. Who is here so base that would be a
2254	bondman? If any, speak; for him have I offended.
2255	Who is here so rude that would not be a Roman? If
2256	any, speak; for him have I offended. Who is here so
2257	vile that will not love his country? If any, speak;
2258	for him have I offended. I pause for a reply.
2259	
2260	All	None, Brutus, none.
2261	
2262	BRUTUS	Then none have I offended. I have done no more to
2263	Caesar than you shall do to Brutus. The question of
2264	his death is enrolled in the Capitol; his glory not
2265	extenuated, wherein he was worthy, nor his offences
2266	enforced, for which he suffered death.
2267	
2268	[Enter ANTONY and others, with CAESAR's body]
2269	
2270	Here comes his body, mourned by Mark Antony: who,
2271	though he had no hand in his death, shall receive
2272	the benefit of his dying, a place in the
2273	commonwealth; as which of you shall not? With this
2274	I depart,--that, as I slew my best lover for the
2275	good of Rome, I have the same dagger for myself,
2276	when it shall please my country to need my death.
2277	
2278	All	Live, Brutus! live, live!
2279	
2280	First Citizen	Bring him with triumph home unto his house.
2281	
2282	Second Citizen	Give him a statue with his ancestors.
2283	
2284	Third Citizen	Let him be Caesar.
2285	
2286	Fourth Citizen	                  Caesar's better parts
2287	Shall be crown'd in Brutus.
2288	
2289	First Citizen	We'll bring him to his house
2290	With shouts and clamours.
2291	
2292	BRUTUS	My countrymen,--
2293	
2294	Second Citizen	Peace, silence! Brutus speaks.
2295	
2296	First Citizen	Peace, ho!
2297	
2298	BRUTUS	Good countrymen, let me depart alone,
2299	And, for my sake, stay here with Antony:
2300	Do grace to Caesar's corpse, and grace his speech
2301	Tending to Caesar's glories; which Mark Antony,
2302	By our permission, is allow'd to make.
2303	I do entreat you, not a man depart,
2304	Save I alone, till Antony have spoke.
2305	
2306	[Exit]
2307	
2308	First Citizen	Stay, ho! and let us hear Mark Antony.
2309	
2310	Third Citizen	Let him go up into the public chair;
2311	We'll hear him. Noble Antony, go up.
2312	
2313	ANTONY	For Brutus' sake, I am beholding to you.
2314	
2315	[Goes into the pulpit]
2316	
2317	Fourth Citizen	What does he say of Brutus?
2318	
2319	Third Citizen	He says, for Brutus' sake,
2320	He finds himself beholding to us all.
2321	
2322	Fourth Citizen	'Twere best he speak no harm of Brutus here.
2323	
2324	First Citizen	This Caesar was a tyrant.
2325	
2326	Third Citizen	Nay, that's certain:
2327	We are blest that Rome is rid of him.
2328	
2329	Second Citizen	Peace! let us hear what Antony can say.
2330	
2331	ANTONY	You gentle Romans,--
2332	
2333	Citizens	Peace, ho! let us hear him.
2334	
2335	ANTONY	Friends, Romans, countrymen, lend me your ears;
2336	I come to bury Caesar, not to praise him.
2337	The evil that men do lives after them;
2338	The good is oft interred with their bones;
2339	So let it be with Caesar. The noble Brutus
2340	Hath told you Caesar was ambitious:
2341	If it were so, it was a grievous fault,
2342	And grievously hath Caesar answer'd it.
2343	Here, under leave of Brutus and the rest--
2344	For Brutus is an honourable man;
2345	So are they all, all honourable men--
2346	Come I to speak in Caesar's funeral.
2347	He was my friend, faithful and just to me:
2348	But Brutus says he was ambitious;
2349	And Brutus is an honourable man.
2350	He hath brought many captives home to Rome
2351	Whose ransoms did the general coffers fill:
2352	Did this in Caesar seem ambitious?
2353	When that the poor have cried, Caesar hath wept:
2354	Ambition should be made of sterner stuff:
2355	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
2356	And Brutus is an honourable man.
2357	You all did see that on the Lupercal
2358	I thrice presented him a kingly crown,
2359	Which he did thrice refuse: was this ambition?
2360	Yet Brutus says he was ambitious;
2361	And, sure, he is an honourable man.
2362	I speak not to disprove what Brutus spoke,
2363	But here I am to speak what I do know.
2364	You all did love him once, not without cause:
2365	What cause withholds you then, to mourn for him?
2366	O judgment! thou art fled to brutish beasts,
2367	And men have lost their reason. Bear with me;
2368	My heart is in the coffin there with Caesar,
2369	And I must pause till it come back to me.
2370	
2371	First Citizen	Methinks there is much reason in his sayings.
2372	
2373	Second Citizen	If thou consider rightly of the matter,
2374	Caesar has had great wrong.
2375	
2376	Third Citizen	Has he, masters?
2377	I fear there will a worse come in his place.
2378	
2379	Fourth Citizen	Mark'd ye his words? He would not take the crown;
2380	Therefore 'tis certain he was not ambitious.
2381	
2382	First Citizen	If it be found so, some will dear abide it.
2383	
2384	Second Citizen	Poor soul! his eyes are red as fire with weeping.
2385	
2386	Third Citizen	There's not a nobler man in Rome than Antony.
2387	
2388	Fourth Citizen	Now mark him, he begins again to speak.
2389	
2390	ANTONY	But yesterday the word of Caesar might
2391	Have stood against the world; now lies he there.
2392	And none so poor to do him reverence.
2393	O masters, if I were disposed to stir
2394	Your hearts and minds to mutiny and rage,
2395	I should do Brutus wrong, and Cassius wrong,
2396	Who, you all know, are honourable men:
2397	I will not do them wrong; I rather choose
2398	To wrong the dead, to wrong myself and you,
2399	Than I will wrong such honourable men.
2400	But here's a parchment with the seal of Caesar;
2401	I found it in his closet, 'tis his will:
2402	Let but the commons hear this testament--
2403	Which, pardon me, I do not mean to read--
2404	And they would go and kiss dead Caesar's wounds
2405	And dip their napkins in his sacred blood,
2406	Yea, beg a hair of him for memory,
2407	And, dying, mention it within their wills,
2408	Bequeathing it as a rich legacy
2409	Unto their issue.
2410	
2411	Fourth Citizen	We'll hear the will: read it, Mark Antony.
2412	
2413	All	The will, the will! we will hear Caesar's will.
2414	
2415	ANTONY	Have patience, gentle friends, I must not read it;
2416	It is not meet you know how Caesar loved you.
2417	You are not wood, you are not stones, but men;
2418	And, being men, bearing the will of Caesar,
2419	It will inflame you, it will make you mad:
2420	'Tis good you know not that you are his heirs;
2421	For, if you should, O, what would come of it!
2422	
2423	Fourth Citizen	Read the will; we'll hear it, Antony;
2424	You shall read us the will, Caesar's will.
2425	
2426	ANTONY	Will you be patient? will you stay awhile?
2427	I have o'ershot myself to tell you of it:
2428	I fear I wrong the honourable men
2429	Whose daggers have stabb'd Caesar; I do fear it.
2430	
2431	Fourth Citizen	They were traitors: honourable men!
2432	
2433	All	The will! the testament!
2434	
2435	Second Citizen	They were villains, murderers: the will! read the will.
2436	
2437	ANTONY	You will compel me, then, to read the will?
2438	Then make a ring about the corpse of Caesar,
2439	And let me show you him that made the will.
2440	Shall I descend? and will you give me leave?
2441	
2442	Several Citizens	Come down.
2443	
2444	Second Citizen	Descend.
2445	
2446	Third Citizen	You shall have leave.
2447	
2448	[ANTONY comes down]
2449	
2450	Fourth Citizen	A ring; stand round.
2451	
2452	First Citizen	Stand from the hearse, stand from the body.
2453	
2454	Second Citizen	Room for Antony, most noble Antony.
2455	
2456	ANTONY	Nay, press not so upon me; stand far off.
2457	
2458	Several Citizens	Stand back; room; bear back.
2459	
2460	ANTONY	If you have tears, prepare to shed them now.
2461	You all do know this mantle: I remember
2462	The first time ever Caesar put it on;
2463	'Twas on a summer's evening, in his tent,
2464	That day he overcame the Nervii:
2465	Look, in this place ran Cassius' dagger through:
2466	See what a rent the envious Casca made:
2467	Through this the well-beloved Brutus stabb'd;
2468	And as he pluck'd his cursed steel away,
2469	Mark how the blood of Caesar follow'd it,
2470	As rushing out of doors, to be resolved
2471	If Brutus so unkindly knock'd, or no;
2472	For Brutus, as you know, was Caesar's angel:
2473	Judge, O you gods, how dearly Caesar loved him!
2474	This was the most unkindest cut of all;
2475	For when the noble Caesar saw him stab,
2476	Ingratitude, more strong than traitors' arms,
2477	Quite vanquish'd him: then burst his mighty heart;
2478	And, in his mantle muffling up his face,
2479	Even at the base of Pompey's statua,
2480	Which all the while ran blood, great Caesar fell.
2481	O, what a fall was there, my countrymen!
2482	Then I, and you, and all of us fell down,
2483	Whilst bloody treason flourish'd over us.
2484	O, now you weep; and, I perceive, you feel
2485	The dint of pity: these are gracious drops.
2486	Kind souls, what, weep you when you but behold
2487	Our Caesar's vesture wounded? Look you here,
2488	Here is himself, marr'd, as you see, with traitors.
2489	
2490	First Citizen	O piteous spectacle!
2491	
2492	Second Citizen	O noble Caesar!
2493	
2494	Third Citizen	O woful day!
2495	
2496	Fourth Citizen	O traitors, villains!
2497	
2498	First Citizen	O most bloody sight!
2499	
2500	Second Citizen	We will be revenged.
2501	
2502	All	Revenge! About! Seek! Burn! Fire! Kill! Slay!
2503	Let not a traitor live!
2504	
2505	ANTONY	Stay, countrymen.
2506	
2507	First Citizen	Peace there! hear the noble Antony.
2508	
2509	Second Citizen	We'll hear him, we'll follow him, we'll die with him.
2510	
2511	ANTONY	Good friends, sweet friends, let me not stir you up
2512	To such a sudden flood of mutiny.
2513	They that have done this deed are honourable:
2514	What private griefs they have, alas, I know not,
2515	That made them do it: they are wise and honourable,
2516	And will, no doubt, with reasons answer you.
2517	I come not, friends, to steal away your hearts:
2518	I am no orator, as Brutus is;
2519	But, as you know me all, a plain blunt man,
2520	That love my friend; and that they know full well
2521	That gave me public leave to speak of him:
2522	For I have neither wit, nor words, nor worth,
2523	Action, nor utterance, nor the power of speech,
2524	To stir men's blood: I only speak right on;
2525	I tell you that which you yourselves do know;
2526	Show you sweet Caesar's wounds, poor poor dumb mouths,
2527	And bid them speak for me: but were I Brutus,
2528	And Brutus Antony, there were an Antony
2529	Would ruffle up your spirits and put a tongue
2530	In every wound of Caesar that should move
2531	The stones of Rome to rise and mutiny.
2532	
2533	All	We'll mutiny.
2534	
2535	First Citizen	We'll burn the house of Brutus.
2536	
2537	Third Citizen	Away, then! come, seek the conspirators.
2538	
2539	ANTONY	Yet hear me, countrymen; yet hear me speak.
2540	
2541	All	Peace, ho! Hear Antony. Most noble Antony!
2542	
2543	ANTONY	Why, friends, you go to do you know not what:
2544	Wherein hath Caesar thus deserved your loves?
2545	Alas, you know not: I must tell you then:
2546	You have forgot the will I told you of.
2547	
2548	All	Most true. The will! Let's stay and hear the will.
2549	
2550	ANTONY	Here is the will, and under Caesar's seal.
2551	To every Roman citizen he gives,
2552	To every several man, seventy-five drachmas.
2553	
2554	Second Citizen	Most noble Caesar! We'll revenge his death.
2555	
2556	Third Citizen	O royal Caesar!
2557	
2558	ANTONY	Hear me with patience.
2559	
2560	All	Peace, ho!
2561	
2562	ANTONY	Moreover, he hath left you all his walks,
2563	His private arbours and new-planted orchards,
2564	On this side Tiber; he hath left them you,
2565	And to your heirs for ever, common pleasures,
2566	To walk abroad, and recreate yourselves.
2567	Here was a Caesar! when comes such another?
2568	
2569	First Citizen	Never, never. Come, away, away!
2570	We'll burn his body in the holy place,
2571	And with the brands fire the traitors' houses.
2572	Take up the body.
2573	
2574	Second Citizen	Go fetch fire.
2575	
2576	Third Citizen	Pluck down benches.
2577	
2578	Fourth Citizen	Pluck down forms, windows, any thing.
2579	
2580	[Exeunt Citizens with the body]
2581	
2582	ANTONY	Now let it work. Mischief, thou art afoot,
2583	Take thou what course thou wilt!
2584	
2585	[Enter a Servant]
2586	
2587	How now, fellow!
2588	
2589	Servant	Sir, Octavius is already come to Rome.
2590	
2591	ANTONY	Where is he?
2592	
2593	Servant	He and Lepidus are at Caesar's house.
2594	
2595	ANTONY	And thither will I straight to visit him:
2596	He comes upon a wish. Fortune is merry,
2597	And in this mood will give us any thing.
2598	
2599	Servant	I heard him say, Brutus and Cassius
2600	Are rid like madmen through the gates of Rome.
2601	
2602	ANTONY	Belike they had some notice of the people,
2603	How I had moved them. Bring me to Octavius.

2616	
2617	SCENE III	A street.
2618	
2619	
2620	[Enter CINNA the poet]
2621	
2622	CINNA THE POET	I dreamt to-night that I did feast with Caesar,
2623	And things unlucky charge my fantasy:
2624	I have no will to wander forth of doors,
2625	Yet something leads me forth.
2626	
2627	[Enter Citizens]
2628	
2629	First Citizen	What is your name?
2630	
2631	Second Citizen	Whither are you going?
2632	
2633	Third Citizen	Where do you dwell?
2634	
2635	Fourth Citizen	Are you a married man or a bachelor?
2636	
2637	Second Citizen	Answer every man directly.
2638	
2639	First Citizen	Ay, and briefly.
2640	
2641	Fourth Citizen	Ay, and wisely.
2642	
2643	Third Citizen	Ay, and truly, you were best.
2644	
2645	CINNA THE POET	What is my name? Whither am I going? Where do I
2646	dwell? Am I a married man or a bachelor? Then, to
2647	answer every man directly and briefly, wisely and
2648	truly: wisely I say, I am a bachelor.
2649	
2650	Second Citizen	That's as much as to say, they are fools that marry:
2651	you'll bear me a bang for that, I fear. Proceed; directly.
2652	
2653	CINNA THE POET	Directly, I am going to Caesar's funeral.
2654	
2655	First Citizen	As a friend or an enemy?
2656	
2657	CINNA THE POET	As a friend.
2658	
2659	Second Citizen	That matter is answered directly.
2660	
2661	Fourth Citizen	For your dwelling,--briefly.
2662	
2663	CINNA THE POET	Briefly, I dwell by the Capitol.
2664	
2665	Third Citizen	Your name, sir, truly.
2666	
2667	CINNA THE POET	Truly, my name is Cinna.
2668	
2669	First Citizen	Tear him to pieces; he's a conspirator.
2670	
2671	CINNA THE POET	I am Cinna the poet, I am Cinna the poet.
2672	
2673	Fourth Citizen	Tear him for his bad verses, tear him for his bad verses.
2674	
2675	CINNA THE POET	I am not Cinna the conspirator.
2676	
2677	Fourth Citizen	It is no matter, his name's Cinna; pluck but his
2678	name out of his heart, and turn him going.

2695	
2696	SCENE I	A house in Rome.
2697	
2698	
2699	[ANTONY, OCTAVIUS, and LEPIDUS, seated at a table]
2700	
2701	ANTONY	These many, then, shall die; their names are prick'd.
2702	
2703	OCTAVIUS	Your brother too must die; consent you, Lepidus?
2704	
2705	LEPIDUS	I do consent--
2706	
2707	OCTAVIUS	                  Prick him down, Antony.
2708	
2709	LEPIDUS	Upon condition Publius shall not live,
2710	Who is your sister's son, Mark Antony.
2711	
2712	ANTONY	He shall not live; look, with a spot I damn him.
2713	But, Lepidus, go you to Caesar's house;
2714	Fetch the will hither, and we shall determine
2715	How to cut off some charge in legacies.
2716	
2717	LEPIDUS	What, shall I find you here?
2718	
2719	OCTAVIUS	Or here, or at the Capitol.
2720	
2721	[Exit LEPIDUS]
2722	
2723	ANTONY	This is a slight unmeritable man,
2724	Meet to be sent on errands: is it fit,
2725	The three-fold world divided, he should stand
2726	One of the three to share it?
2727	
2728	OCTAVIUS	So you thought him;
2729	And took his voice who should be prick'd to die,
2730	In our black sentence and proscription.
2731	
2732	ANTONY	Octavius, I have seen more days than you:
2733	And though we lay these honours on this man,
2734	To ease ourselves of divers slanderous loads,
2735	He shall but bear them as the ass bears gold,
2736	To groan and sweat under the business,
2737	Either led or driven, as we point the way;
2738	And having brought our treasure where we will,
2739	Then take we down his load, and turn him off,
2740	Like to the empty ass, to shake his ears,
2741	And graze in commons.
2742	
2743	OCTAVIUS	You may do your will;
2744	But he's a tried and valiant soldier.
2745	
2746	ANTONY	So is my horse, Octavius; and for that
2747	I do appoint him store of provender:
2748	It is a creature that I teach to fight,
2749	To wind, to stop, to run directly on,
2750	His corporal motion govern'd by my spirit.
2751	And, in some taste, is Lepidus but so;
2752	He must be taught and train'd and bid go forth;
2753	A barren-spirited fellow; one that feeds
2754	On abjects, orts and imitations,
2755	Which, out of use and staled by other men,
2756	Begin his fashion: do not talk of him,
2757	But as a property. And now, Octavius,
2758	Listen great things:--Brutus and Cassius
2759	Are levying powers: we must straight make head:
2760	Therefore let our alliance be combined,
2761	Our best friends made, our means stretch'd
2762	And let us presently go sit in council,
2763	How covert matters may be best disclosed,
2764	And open perils surest answered.
2765	
2766	OCTAVIUS	Let us do so: for we are at the stake,
2767	And bay'd about with many enemies;
2768	And some that smile have in their hearts, I fear,
2769	Millions of mischiefs.

2784	
2785	
2786	[Drum. Enter BRUTUS, LUCILIUS, LUCIUS, and
2787	Soldiers; TITINIUS and PINDARUS meeting them]
2788	
2789	BRUTUS	Stand, ho!
2790	
2791	LUCILIUS	Give the word, ho! and stand.
2792	
2793	BRUTUS	What now, Lucilius! is Cassius near?
2794	
2795	LUCILIUS	He is at hand; and Pindarus is come
2796	To do you salutation from his master.
2797	
2798	BRUTUS	He greets me well. Your master, Pindarus,
2799	In his own change, or by ill officers,
2800	Hath given me some worthy cause to wish
2801	Things done, undone: but, if he be at hand,
2802	I shall be satisfied.
2803	
2804	PINDARUS	I do not doubt
2805	But that my noble master will appear
2806	Such as he is, full of regard and honour.
2807	
2808	BRUTUS	He is not doubted. A word, Lucilius;
2809	How he received you, let me be resolved.
2810	
2811	LUCILIUS	With courtesy and with respect enough;
2812	But not with such familiar instances,
2813	Nor with such free and friendly conference,
2814	As he hath used of old.
2815	
2816	BRUTUS	Thou hast described
2817	A hot friend cooling: ever note, Lucilius,
2818	When love begins to sicken and decay,
2819	It useth an enforced ceremony.
2820	There are no tricks in plain and simple faith;
2821	But hollow men, like horses hot at hand,
2822	Make gallant show and promise of their mettle;
2823	But when they should endure the bloody spur,
2824	They fall their crests, and, like deceitful jades,
2825	Sink in the trial. Comes his army on?
2826	
2827	LUCILIUS	They mean this night in Sardis to be quarter'd;
2828	The greater part, the horse in general,
2829	Are come with Cassius.
2830	
2831	BRUTUS	Hark! he is arrived.
2832	
2833	[Low march within]
2834	
2835	March gently on to meet him.
2836	
2837	[Enter CASSIUS and his powers]
2838	
2839	CASSIUS	Stand, ho!
2840	
2841	BRUTUS	Stand, ho! Speak the word along.
2842	
2843	First Soldier	Stand!
2844	
2845	Second Soldier	Stand!
2846	
2847	Third Soldier	Stand!
2848	
2849	CASSIUS	Most noble brother, you have done me wrong.
2850	
2851	BRUTUS	Judge me, you gods! wrong I mine enemies?
2852	And, if not so, how should I wrong a brother?
2853	
2854	CASSIUS	Brutus, this sober form of yours hides wrongs;
2855	And when you do them--
2856	
2857	BRUTUS	Cassius, be content.
2858	Speak your griefs softly: I do know you well.
2859	Before the eyes of both our armies here,
2860	Which should perceive nothing but love from us,
2861	Let us not wrangle: bid them move away;
2862	Then in my tent, Cassius, enlarge your griefs,
2863	And I will give you audience.
2864	
2865	CASSIUS	Pindarus,
2866	Bid our commanders lead their charges off
2867	A little from this ground.
2868	
2869	BRUTUS	Lucilius, do you the like; and let no man
2870	Come to our tent till we have done our conference.
2871	Let Lucius and Titinius guard our door.

2885	SCENE III	Brutus's tent.
2886	
2887	
2888	[Enter BRUTUS and CASSIUS]
2889	
2890	CASSIUS	That you have wrong'd me doth appear in this:
2891	You have condemn'd and noted Lucius Pella
2892	For taking bribes here of the Sardians;
2893	Wherein my letters, praying on his side,
2894	Because I knew the man, were slighted off.
2895	
2896	BRUTUS	You wronged yourself to write in such a case.
2897	
2898	CASSIUS	In such a time as this it is not meet
2899	That every nice offence should bear his comment.
2900	
2901	BRUTUS	Let me tell you, Cassius, you yourself
2902	Are much condemn'd to have an itching palm;
2903	To sell and mart your offices for gold
2904	To undeservers.
2905	
2906	CASSIUS	                  I an itching palm!
2907	You know that you are Brutus that speak this,
2908	Or, by the gods, this speech were else your last.
2909	
2910	BRUTUS	The name of Cassius honours this corruption,
2911	And chastisement doth therefore hide his head.
2912	
2913	CASSIUS	Chastisement!
2914	
2915	BRUTUS	Remember March, the ides of March remember:
2916	Did not great Julius bleed for justice' sake?
2917	What villain touch'd his body, that did stab,
2918	And not for justice? What, shall one of us
2919	That struck the foremost man of all this world
2920	But for supporting robbers, shall we now
2921	Contaminate our fingers with base bribes,
2922	And sell the mighty space of our large honours
2923	For so much trash as may be grasped thus?
2924	I had rather be a dog, and bay the moon,
2925	Than such a Roman.
2926	
2927	CASSIUS	                  Brutus, bay not me;
2928	I'll not endure it: you forget yourself,
2929	To hedge me in; I am a soldier, I,
2930	Older in practise, abler than yourself
2931	To make conditions.
2932	
2933	BRUTUS	Go to; you are not, Cassius.
2934	
2935	CASSIUS	I am.
2936	
2937	BRUTUS	I say you are not.
2938	
2939	CASSIUS	Urge me no more, I shall forget myself;
2940	Have mind upon your health, tempt me no further.
2941	
2942	BRUTUS	Away, slight man!
2943	
2944	CASSIUS	Is't possible?
2945	
2946	BRUTUS	                  Hear me, for I will speak.
2947	Must I give way and room to your rash choler?
2948	Shall I be frighted when a madman stares?
2949	
2950	CASSIUS	O ye gods, ye gods! must I endure all this?
2951	
2952	BRUTUS	All this! ay, more: fret till your proud heart break;
2953	Go show your slaves how choleric you are,
2954	And make your bondmen tremble. Must I budge?
2955	Must I observe you? must I stand and crouch
2956	Under your testy humour? By the gods
2957	You shall digest the venom of your spleen,
2958	Though it do split you; for, from this day forth,
2959	I'll use you for my mirth, yea, for my laughter,
2960	When you are waspish.
2961	
2962	CASSIUS	Is it come to this?
2963	
2964	BRUTUS	You say you are a better soldier:
2965	Let it appear so; make your vaunting true,
2966	And it shall please me well: for mine own part,
2967	I shall be glad to learn of noble men.
2968	
2969	CASSIUS	You wrong me every way; you wrong me, Brutus;
2970	I said, an elder soldier, not a better:
2971	Did I say 'better'?
2972	
2973	BRUTUS	If you did, I care not.
2974	
2975	CASSIUS	When Caesar lived, he durst not thus have moved me.
2976	
2977	BRUTUS	Peace, peace! you durst not so have tempted him.
2978	
2979	CASSIUS	I durst not!
2980	
2981	BRUTUS	No.
2982	
2983	CASSIUS	What, durst not tempt him!
2984	
2985	BRUTUS	For your life you durst not!
2986	
2987	CASSIUS	Do not presume too much upon my love;
2988	I may do that I shall be sorry for.
2989	
2990	BRUTUS	You have done that you should be sorry for.
2991	There is no terror, Cassius, in your threats,
2992	For I am arm'd so strong in honesty
2993	That they pass by me as the idle wind,
2994	Which I respect not. I did send to you
2995	For certain sums of gold, which you denied me:
2996	For I can raise no money by vile means:
2997	By heaven, I had rather coin my heart,
2998	And drop my blood for drachmas, than to wring
2999	From the hard hands of peasants their vile trash
3000	By any indirection: I did send
3001	To you for gold to pay my legions,
3002	Which you denied me: was that done like Cassius?
3003	Should I have answer'd Caius Cassius so?
3004	When Marcus Brutus grows so covetous,
3005	To lock such rascal counters from his friends,
3006	Be ready, gods, with all your thunderbolts;
3007	Dash him to pieces!
3008	
3009	CASSIUS	I denied you not.
3010	
3011	BRUTUS	You did.
3012	
3013	CASSIUS	I did not: he was but a fool that brought
3014	My answer back. Brutus hath rived my heart:
3015	A friend should bear his friend's infirmities,
3016	But Brutus makes mine greater than they are.
3017	
3018	BRUTUS	I do not, till you practise them on me.
3019	
3020	CASSIUS	You love me not.
3021	
3022	BRUTUS	                  I do not like your faults.
3023	
3024	CASSIUS	A friendly eye could never see such faults.
3025	
3026	BRUTUS	A flatterer's would not, though they do appear
3027	As huge as high Olympus.
3028	
3029	CASSIUS	Come, Antony, and young Octavius, come,
3030	Revenge yourselves alone on Cassius,
3031	For Cassius is aweary of the world;
3032	Hated by one he loves; braved by his brother;
3033	Cheque'd like a bondman; all his faults observed,
3034	Set in a note-book, learn'd, and conn'd by rote,
3035	To cast into my teeth. O, I could weep
3036	My spirit from mine eyes! There is my dagger,
3037	And here my naked breast; within, a heart
3038	Dearer than Plutus' mine, richer than gold:
3039	If that thou be'st a Roman, take it forth;
3040	I, that denied thee gold, will give my heart:
3041	Strike, as thou didst at Caesar; for, I know,
3042	When thou didst hate him worst, thou lovedst him better
3043	Than ever thou lovedst Cassius.
3044	
3045	BRUTUS	Sheathe your dagger:
3046	Be angry when you will, it shall have scope;
3047	Do what you will, dishonour shall be humour.
3048	O Cassius, you are yoked with a lamb
3049	That carries anger as the flint bears fire;
3050	Who, much enforced, shows a hasty spark,
3051	And straight is cold again.
3052	
3053	CASSIUS	Hath Cassius lived
3054	To be but mirth and laughter to his Brutus,
3055	When grief, and blood ill-temper'd, vexeth him?
3056	
3057	BRUTUS	When I spoke that, I was ill-temper'd too.
3058	
3059	CASSIUS	Do you confess so much? Give me your hand.
3060	
3061	BRUTUS	And my heart too.
3062	
3063	CASSIUS	                  O Brutus!
3064	
3065	BRUTUS	What's the matter?
3066	
3067	CASSIUS	Have not you love enough to bear with me,
3068	When that rash humour which my mother gave me
3069	Makes me forgetful?
3070	
3071	BRUTUS	Yes, Cassius; and, from henceforth,
3072	When you are over-earnest with your Brutus,
3073	He'll think your mother chides, and leave you so.
3074	
3075	Poet	[Within]  Let me go in to see the generals;
3076	There is some grudge between 'em, 'tis not meet
3077	They be alone.
3078	
3079	LUCILIUS	[Within]  You shall not come to them.
3080	
3081	Poet	[Within]  Nothing but death shall stay me.
3082	
3083	[Enter Poet, followed by LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, and LUCIUS]
3084	
3085	CASSIUS	How now! what's the matter?
3086	
3087	Poet	For shame, you generals! what do you mean?
3088	Love, and be friends, as two such men should be;
3089	For I have seen more years, I'm sure, than ye.
3090	
3091	CASSIUS	Ha, ha! how vilely doth this cynic rhyme!
3092	
3093	BRUTUS	Get you hence, sirrah; saucy fellow, hence!
3094	
3095	CASSIUS	Bear with him, Brutus; 'tis his fashion.
3096	
3097	BRUTUS	I'll know his humour, when he knows his time:
3098	What should the wars do with these jigging fools?
3099	Companion, hence!
3100	
3101	CASSIUS	                  Away, away, be gone.
3102	
3103	[Exit Poet]
3104	
3105	BRUTUS	Lucilius and Titinius, bid the commanders
3106	Prepare to lodge their companies to-night.
3107	
3108	CASSIUS	And come yourselves, and bring Messala with you
3109	Immediately to us.
3110	
3111	[Exeunt LUCILIUS and TITINIUS]
3112	
3113	BRUTUS	Lucius, a bowl of wine!
3114	
3115	[Exit LUCIUS]
3116	
3117	CASSIUS	I did not think you could have been so angry.
3118	
3119	BRUTUS	O Cassius, I am sick of many griefs.
3120	
3121	CASSIUS	Of your philosophy you make no use,
3122	If you give place to accidental evils.
3123	
3124	BRUTUS	No man bears sorrow better. Portia is dead.
3125	
3126	CASSIUS	Ha! Portia!
3127	
3128	BRUTUS	She is dead.
3129	
3130	CASSIUS	How 'scaped I killing when I cross'd you so?
3131	O insupportable and touching loss!
3132	Upon what sickness?
3133	
3134	BRUTUS	Impatient of my absence,
3135	And grief that young Octavius with Mark Antony
3136	Have made themselves so strong:--for with her death
3137	That tidings came;--with this she fell distract,
3138	And, her attendants absent, swallow'd fire.
3139	
3140	CASSIUS	And died so?
3141	
3142	BRUTUS	                  Even so.
3143	
3144	CASSIUS	O ye immortal gods!
3145	
3146	[Re-enter LUCIUS, with wine and taper]
3147	
3148	BRUTUS	Speak no more of her. Give me a bowl of wine.
3149	In this I bury all unkindness, Cassius.
3150	
3151	CASSIUS	My heart is thirsty for that noble pledge.
3152	Fill, Lucius, till the wine o'erswell the cup;
3153	I cannot drink too much of Brutus' love.
3154	
3155	BRUTUS	Come in, Titinius!
3156	
3157	[Exit LUCIUS]
3158	
3159	[Re-enter TITINIUS, with MESSALA]
3160	
3161	Welcome, good Messala.
3162	Now sit we close about this taper here,
3163	And call in question our necessities.
3164	
3165	CASSIUS	Portia, art thou gone?
3166	
3167	BRUTUS	No more, I pray you.
3168	Messala, I have here received letters,
3169	That young Octavius and Mark Antony
3170	Come down upon us with a mighty power,
3171	Bending their expedition toward Philippi.
3172	
3173	MESSALA	Myself have letters of the selfsame tenor.
3174	
3175	BRUTUS	With what addition?
3176	
3177	MESSALA	That by proscription and bills of outlawry,
3178	Octavius, Antony, and Lepidus,
3179	Have put to death an hundred senators.
3180	
3181	BRUTUS	Therein our letters do not well agree;
3182	Mine speak of seventy senators that died
3183	By their proscriptions, Cicero being one.
3184	
3185	CASSIUS	Cicero one!
3186	
3187	MESSALA	          Cicero is dead,
3188	And by that order of proscription.
3189	Had you your letters from your wife, my lord?
3190	
3191	BRUTUS	No, Messala.
3192	
3193	MESSALA	Nor nothing in your letters writ of her?
3194	
3195	BRUTUS	Nothing, Messala.
3196	
3197	MESSALA	                  That, methinks, is strange.
3198	
3199	BRUTUS	Why ask you? hear you aught of her in yours?
3200	
3201	MESSALA	No, my lord.
3202	
3203	BRUTUS	Now, as you are a Roman, tell me true.
3204	
3205	MESSALA	Then like a Roman bear the truth I tell:
3206	For certain she is dead, and by strange manner.
3207	
3208	BRUTUS	Why, farewell, Portia. We must die, Messala:
3209	With meditating that she must die once,
3210	I have the patience to endure it now.
3211	
3212	MESSALA	Even so great men great losses should endure.
3213	
3214	CASSIUS	I have as much of this in art as you,
3215	But yet my nature could not bear it so.
3216	
3217	BRUTUS	Well, to our work alive. What do you think
3218	Of marching to Philippi presently?
3219	
3220	CASSIUS	I do not think it good.
3221	
3222	BRUTUS	Your reason?
3223	
3224	CASSIUS	This it is:
3225	'Tis better that the enemy seek us:
3226	So shall he waste his means, weary his soldiers,
3227	Doing himself offence; whilst we, lying still,
3228	Are full of rest, defense, and nimbleness.
3229	
3230	BRUTUS	Good reasons must, of force, give place to better.
3231	The people 'twixt Philippi and this ground
3232	Do stand but in a forced affection;
3233	For they have grudged us contribution:
3234	The enemy, marching along by them,
3235	By them shall make a fuller number up,
3236	Come on refresh'd, new-added, and encouraged;
3237	From which advantage shall we cut him off,
3238	If at Philippi we do face him there,
3239	These people at our back.
3240	
3241	CASSIUS	Hear me, good brother.
3242	
3243	BRUTUS	Under your pardon. You must note beside,
3244	That we have tried the utmost of our friends,
3245	Our legions are brim-full, our cause is ripe:
3246	The enemy increaseth every day;
3247	We, at the height, are ready to decline.
3248	There is a tide in the affairs of men,
3249	Which, taken at the flood, leads on to fortune;
3250	Omitted, all the voyage of their life
3251	Is bound in shallows and in miseries.
3252	On such a full sea are we now afloat;
3253	And we must take the current when it serves,
3254	Or lose our ventures.
3255	
3256	CASSIUS	Then, with your will, go on;
3257	We'll along ourselves, and meet them at Philippi.
3258	
3259	BRUTUS	The deep of night is crept upon our talk,
3260	And nature must obey necessity;
3261	Which we will niggard with a little rest.
3262	There is no more to say?
3263	
3264	CASSIUS	No more. Good night:
3265	Early to-morrow will we rise, and hence.
3266	
3267	BRUTUS	Lucius!
3268	
3269	[Enter LUCIUS]
3270	My gown.
3271	
3272	[Exit LUCIUS]
3273	
3274	Farewell, good Messala:
3275	Good night, Titinius. Noble, noble Cassius,
3276	Good night, and good repose.
3277	
3278	CASSIUS	O my dear brother!
3279	This was an ill beginning of the night:
3280	Never come such division 'tween our souls!
3281	Let it not, Brutus.
3282	
3283	BRUTUS	Every thing is well.
3284	
3285	CASSIUS	Good night, my lord.
3286	
3287	BRUTUS	Good night, good brother.
3288	
3289	
3290	TITINIUS	|
3291	| Good night, Lord Brutus.
3292	MESSALA	|
3293	
3294	
3295	BRUTUS	Farewell, every one.
3296	
3297	[Exeunt all but BRUTUS]
3298	
3299	[Re-enter LUCIUS, with the gown]
3300	
3301	Give me the gown. Where is thy instrument?
3302	
3303	LUCIUS	Here in the tent.
3304	
3305	BRUTUS	                  What, thou speak'st drowsily?
3306	Poor knave, I blame thee not; thou art o'er-watch'd.
3307	Call Claudius and some other of my men:
3308	I'll have them sleep on cushions in my tent.
3309	
3310	LUCIUS	Varro and Claudius!
3311	
3312	[Enter VARRO and CLAUDIUS]
3313	
3314	VARRO	Calls my lord?
3315	
3316	BRUTUS	I pray you, sirs, lie in my tent and sleep;
3317	It may be I shall raise you by and by
3318	On business to my brother Cassius.
3319	
3320	VARRO	So please you, we will stand and watch your pleasure.
3321	
3322	BRUTUS	I will not have it so: lie down, good sirs;
3323	It may be I shall otherwise bethink me.
3324	Look, Lucius, here's the book I sought for so;
3325	I put it in the pocket of my gown.
3326	
3327	[VARRO and CLAUDIUS lie down]
3328	
3329	LUCIUS	I was sure your lordship did not give it me.
3330	
3331	BRUTUS	Bear with me, good boy, I am much forgetful.
3332	Canst thou hold up thy heavy eyes awhile,
3333	And touch thy instrument a strain or two?
3334	
3335	LUCIUS	Ay, my lord, an't please you.
3336	
3337	BRUTUS	It does, my boy:
3338	I trouble thee too much, but thou art willing.
3339	
3340	LUCIUS	It is my duty, sir.
3341	
3342	BRUTUS	I should not urge thy duty past thy might;
3343	I know young bloods look for a time of rest.
3344	
3345	LUCIUS	I have slept, my lord, already.
3346	
3347	BRUTUS	It was well done; and thou shalt sleep again;
3348	I will not hold thee long: if I do live,
3349	I will be good to thee.
3350	
3351	[Music, and a song]
3352	
3353	This is a sleepy tune. O murderous slumber,
3354	Lay'st thou thy leaden mace upon my boy,
3355	That plays thee music? Gentle knave, good night;
3356	I will not do thee so much wrong to wake thee:
3357	If thou dost nod, thou break'st thy instrument;
3358	I'll take it from thee; and, good boy, good night.
3359	Let me see, let me see; is not the leaf turn'd down
3360	Where I left reading? Here it is, I think.
3361	
3362	[Enter the Ghost of CAESAR]
3363	
3364	How ill this taper burns! Ha! who comes here?
3365	I think it is the weakness of mine eyes
3366	That shapes this monstrous apparition.
3367	It comes upon me. Art thou any thing?
3368	Art thou some god, some angel, or some devil,
3369	That makest my blood cold and my hair to stare?
3370	Speak to me what thou art.
3371	
3372	GHOST	Thy evil spirit, Brutus.
3373	
3374	BRUTUS	Why comest thou?
3375	
3376	GHOST	To tell thee thou shalt see me at Philippi.
3377	
3378	BRUTUS	Well; then I shall see thee again?
3379	
3380	GHOST	Ay, at Philippi.
3381	
3382	BRUTUS	Why, I will see thee at Philippi, then.
3383	
3384	[Exit Ghost]
3385	
3386	Now I have taken heart thou vanishest:
3387	Ill spirit, I would hold more talk with thee.
3388	Boy, Lucius! Varro! Claudius! Sirs, awake! Claudius!
3389	
3390	LUCIUS	The strings, my lord, are false.
3391	
3392	BRUTUS	He thinks he still is at his instrument.
3393	Lucius, awake!
3394	
3395	LUCIUS	My lord?
3396	
3397	BRUTUS	Didst thou dream, Lucius, that thou so criedst out?
3398	
3399	LUCIUS	My lord, I do not know that I did cry.
3400	
3401	BRUTUS	Yes, that thou didst: didst thou see any thing?
3402	
3403	LUCIUS	Nothing, my lord.
3404	
3405	BRUTUS	Sleep again, Lucius. Sirrah Claudius!
3406	
3407	[To VARRO]
3408	
3409	Fellow thou, awake!
3410	
3411	VARRO	My lord?
3412	
3413	CLAUDIUS	My lord?
3414	
3415	BRUTUS	Why did you so cry out, sirs, in your sleep?
3416	
3417	
3418	VARRO	|
3419	|  Did we, my lord?
3420	CLAUDIUS	|
3421	
3422	
3423	BRUTUS	Ay: saw you any thing?
3424	
3425	VARRO	No, my lord, I saw nothing.
3426	
3427	CLAUDIUS	Nor I, my lord.
3428	
3429	BRUTUS	Go and commend me to my brother Cassius;
3430	Bid him set on his powers betimes before,
3431	And we will follow.
3432	
3433	
3434	VARRO	|
3435	|                It shall be done, my lord.

3447	ACT V
3448	
3449	
3450	
3451	SCENE I	The plains of Philippi.
3452	
3453	
3454	[Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army]
3455	
3456	OCTAVIUS	Now, Antony, our hopes are answered:
3457	You said the enemy would not come down,
3458	But keep the hills and upper regions;
3459	It proves not so: their battles are at hand;
3460	They mean to warn us at Philippi here,
3461	Answering before we do demand of them.
3462	
3463	ANTONY	Tut, I am in their bosoms, and I know
3464	Wherefore they do it: they could be content
3465	To visit other places; and come down
3466	With fearful bravery, thinking by this face
3467	To fasten in our thoughts that they have courage;
3468	But 'tis not so.
3469	
3470	[Enter a Messenger]
3471	
3472	Messenger	                  Prepare you, generals:
3473	The enemy comes on in gallant show;
3474	Their bloody sign of battle is hung out,
3475	And something to be done immediately.
3476	
3477	ANTONY	Octavius, lead your battle softly on,
3478	Upon the left hand of the even field.
3479	
3480	OCTAVIUS	Upon the right hand I; keep thou the left.
3481	
3482	ANTONY	Why do you cross me in this exigent?
3483	
3484	OCTAVIUS	I do not cross you; but I will do so.
3485	
3486	[March]
3487	
3488	[Drum. Enter BRUTUS, CASSIUS, and their Army;
3489	LUCILIUS, TITINIUS, MESSALA, and others]
3490	
3491	BRUTUS	They stand, and would have parley.
3492	
3493	CASSIUS	Stand fast, Titinius: we must out and talk.
3494	
3495	OCTAVIUS	Mark Antony, shall we give sign of battle?
3496	
3497	ANTONY	No, Caesar, we will answer on their charge.
3498	Make forth; the generals would have some words.
3499	
3500	OCTAVIUS	Stir not until the signal.
3501	
3502	BRUTUS	Words before blows: is it so, countrymen?
3503	
3504	OCTAVIUS	Not that we love words better, as you do.
3505	
3506	BRUTUS	Good words are better than bad strokes, Octavius.
3507	
3508	ANTONY	In your bad strokes, Brutus, you give good words:
3509	Witness the hole you made in Caesar's heart,
3510	Crying 'Long live! hail, Caesar!'
3511	
3512	CASSIUS	Antony,
3513	The posture of your blows are yet unknown;
3514	But for your words, they rob the Hybla bees,
3515	And leave them honeyless.
3516	
3517	ANTONY	Not stingless too.
3518	
3519	BRUTUS	O, yes, and soundless too;
3520	For you have stol'n their buzzing, Antony,
3521	And very wisely threat before you sting.
3522	
3523	ANTONY	Villains, you did not so, when your vile daggers
3524	Hack'd one another in the sides of Caesar:
3525	You show'd your teeth like apes, and fawn'd like hounds,
3526	And bow'd like bondmen, kissing Caesar's feet;
3527	Whilst damned Casca, like a cur, behind
3528	Struck Caesar on the neck. O you flatterers!
3529	
3530	CASSIUS	Flatterers! Now, Brutus, thank yourself:
3531	This tongue had not offended so to-day,
3532	If Cassius might have ruled.
3533	
3534	OCTAVIUS	Come, come, the cause: if arguing make us sweat,
3535	The proof of it will turn to redder drops. Look;
3536	I draw a sword against conspirators;
3537	When think you that the sword goes up again?
3538	Never, till Caesar's three and thirty wounds
3539	Be well avenged; or till another Caesar
3540	Have added slaughter to the sword of traitors.
3541	
3542	BRUTUS	Caesar, thou canst not die by traitors' hands,
3543	Unless thou bring'st them with thee.
3544	
3545	OCTAVIUS	So I hope;
3546	I was not born to die on Brutus' sword.
3547	
3548	BRUTUS	O, if thou wert the noblest of thy strain,
3549	Young man, thou couldst not die more honourable.
3550	
3551	CASSIUS	A peevish schoolboy, worthless of such honour,
3552	Join'd with a masker and a reveller!
3553	
3554	ANTONY	Old Cassius still!
3555	
3556	OCTAVIUS	                  Come, Antony, away!
3557	Defiance, traitors, hurl we in your teeth:
3558	If you dare fight to-day, come to the field;
3559	If not, when you have stomachs.
3560	
3561	[Exeunt OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, and their army]
3562	
3563	CASSIUS	Why, now, blow wind, swell billow and swim bark!
3564	The storm is up, and all is on the hazard.
3565	
3566	BRUTUS	Ho, Lucilius! hark, a word with you.
3567	
3568	LUCILIUS	[Standing forth]	My lord?
3569	
3570	[BRUTUS and LUCILIUS converse apart]
3571	
3572	CASSIUS	Messala!
3573	
3574	MESSALA	[Standing forth]  What says my general?
3575	
3576	CASSIUS	Messala,
3577	This is my birth-day; as this very day
3578	Was Cassius born. Give me thy hand, Messala:
3579	Be thou my witness that against my will,
3580	As Pompey was, am I compell'd to set
3581	Upon one battle all our liberties.
3582	You know that I held Epicurus strong
3583	And his opinion: now I change my mind,
3584	And partly credit things that do presage.
3585	Coming from Sardis, on our former ensign
3586	Two mighty eagles fell, and there they perch'd,
3587	Gorging and feeding from our soldiers' hands;
3588	Who to Philippi here consorted us:
3589	This morning are they fled away and gone;
3590	And in their steads do ravens, crows and kites,
3591	Fly o'er our heads and downward look on us,
3592	As we were sickly prey: their shadows seem
3593	A canopy most fatal, under which
3594	Our army lies, ready to give up the ghost.
3595	
3596	MESSALA	Believe not so.
3597	
3598	CASSIUS	                  I but believe it partly;
3599	For I am fresh of spirit and resolved
3600	To meet all perils very constantly.
3601	
3602	BRUTUS	Even so, Lucilius.
3603	
3604	CASSIUS	                  Now, most noble Brutus,
3605	The gods to-day stand friendly, that we may,
3606	Lovers in peace, lead on our days to age!
3607	But since the affairs of men rest still incertain,
3608	Let's reason with the worst that may befall.
3609	If we do lose this battle, then is this
3610	The very last time we shall speak together:
3611	What are you then determined to do?
3612	
3613	BRUTUS	Even by the rule of that philosophy
3614	By which I did blame Cato for the death
3615	Which he did give himself, I know not how,
3616	But I do find it cowardly and vile,
3617	For fear of what might fall, so to prevent
3618	The time of life: arming myself with patience
3619	To stay the providence of some high powers
3620	That govern us below.
3621	
3622	CASSIUS	Then, if we lose this battle,
3623	You are contented to be led in triumph
3624	Thorough the streets of Rome?
3625	
3626	BRUTUS	No, Cassius, no: think not, thou noble Roman,
3627	That ever Brutus will go bound to Rome;
3628	He bears too great a mind. But this same day
3629	Must end that work the ides of March begun;
3630	And whether we shall meet again I know not.
3631	Therefore our everlasting farewell take:
3632	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Cassius!
3633	If we do meet again, why, we shall smile;
3634	If not, why then, this parting was well made.
3635	
3636	CASSIUS	For ever, and for ever, farewell, Brutus!
3637	If we do meet again, we'll smile indeed;
3638	If not, 'tis true this parting was well made.
3639	
3640	BRUTUS	Why, then, lead on. O, that a man might know
3641	The end of this day's business ere it come!
3642	But it sufficeth that the day will end,
3643	And then the end is known. Come, ho! away!

3659	
3660	[Alarum. Enter BRUTUS and MESSALA]
3661	
3662	BRUTUS	Ride, ride, Messala, ride, and give these bills
3663	Unto the legions on the other side.
3664	
3665	[Loud alarum]
3666	
3667	Let them set on at once; for I perceive
3668	But cold demeanor in Octavius' wing,
3669	And sudden push gives them the overthrow.
3670	Ride, ride, Messala: let them all come down.

3687	[Alarums. Enter CASSIUS and TITINIUS]
3688	
3689	CASSIUS	O, look, Titinius, look, the villains fly!
3690	Myself have to mine own turn'd enemy:
3691	This ensign here of mine was turning back;
3692	I slew the coward, and did take it from him.
3693	
3694	TITINIUS	O Cassius, Brutus gave the word too early;
3695	Who, having some advantage on Octavius,
3696	Took it too eagerly: his soldiers fell to spoil,
3697	Whilst we by Antony are all enclosed.
3698	
3699	[Enter PINDARUS]
3700	
3701	PINDARUS	Fly further off, my lord, fly further off;
3702	Mark Antony is in your tents, my lord
3703	Fly, therefore, noble Cassius, fly far off.
3704	
3705	CASSIUS	This hill is far enough. Look, look, Titinius;
3706	Are those my tents where I perceive the fire?
3707	
3708	TITINIUS	They are, my lord.
3709	
3710	CASSIUS	                  Titinius, if thou lovest me,
3711	Mount thou my horse, and hide thy spurs in him,
3712	Till he have brought thee up to yonder troops,
3713	And here again; that I may rest assured
3714	Whether yond troops are friend or enemy.
3715	
3716	TITINIUS	I will be here again, even with a thought.
3717	
3718	[Exit]
3719	
3720	CASSIUS	Go, Pindarus, get higher on that hill;
3721	My sight was ever thick; regard Titinius,
3722	And tell me what thou notest about the field.
3723	
3724	[PINDARUS ascends the hill]
3725	
3726	This day I breathed first: time is come round,
3727	And where I did begin, there shall I end;
3728	My life is run his compass. Sirrah, what news?
3729	
3730	PINDARUS	[Above]  O my lord!
3731	
3732	CASSIUS	What news?
3733	
3734	PINDARUS	[Above]  Titinius is enclosed round about
3735	With horsemen, that make to him on the spur;
3736	Yet he spurs on. Now they are almost on him.
3737	Now, Titinius! Now some light. O, he lights too.
3738	He's ta'en.
3739	
3740	[Shout]
3741	
3742	And, hark! they shout for joy.
3743	
3744	CASSIUS	Come down, behold no more.
3745	O, coward that I am, to live so long,
3746	To see my best friend ta'en before my face!
3747	
3748	[PINDARUS descends]
3749	
3750	Come hither, sirrah:
3751	In Parthia did I take thee prisoner;
3752	And then I swore thee, saving of thy life,
3753	That whatsoever I did bid thee do,
3754	Thou shouldst attempt it. Come now, keep thine oath;
3755	Now be a freeman: and with this good sword,
3756	That ran through Caesar's bowels, search this bosom.
3757	Stand not to answer: here, take thou the hilts;
3758	And, when my face is cover'd, as 'tis now,
3759	Guide thou the sword.

3761	[PINDARUS stabs him]
3762	
3763	Caesar, thou art revenged,
3764	Even with the sword that kill'd thee.
3765	
3766	[Dies]
3767	
3768	PINDARUS	So, I am free; yet would not so have been,
3769	Durst I have done my will. O Cassius,
3770	Far from this country Pindarus shall run,
3771	Where never Roman shall take note of him.
3772	
3773	[Exit]
3774	
3775	[Re-enter TITINIUS with MESSALA]
3776	
3777	MESSALA	It is but change, Titinius; for Octavius
3778	Is overthrown by noble Brutus' power,
3779	As Cassius' legions are by Antony.
3780	
3781	TITINIUS	These tidings will well comfort Cassius.
3782	
3783	MESSALA	Where did you leave him?
3784	
3785	TITINIUS	All disconsolate,
3786	With Pindarus his bondman, on this hill.
3787	
3788	MESSALA	Is not that he that lies upon the ground?
3789	
3790	TITINIUS	He lies not like the living. O my heart!
3791	
3792	MESSALA	Is not that he?
3793	
3794	TITINIUS	                  No, this was he, Messala,
3795	But Cassius is no more. O setting sun,
3796	As in thy red rays thou dost sink to-night,
3797	So in his red blood Cassius' day is set;
3798	The sun of Rome is set! Our day is gone;
3799	Clouds, dews, and dangers come; our deeds are done!
3800	Mistrust of my success hath done this deed.
3801	
3802	MESSALA	Mistrust of good success hath done this deed.
3803	O hateful error, melancholy's child,
3804	Why dost thou show to the apt thoughts of men
3805	The things that are not? O error, soon conceived,
3806	Thou never comest unto a happy birth,
3807	But kill'st the mother that engender'd thee!
3808	
3809	TITINIUS	What, Pindarus! where art thou, Pindarus?
3810	
3811	MESSALA	Seek him, Titinius, whilst I go to meet
3812	The noble Brutus, thrusting this report
3813	Into his ears; I may say, thrusting it;
3814	For piercing steel and darts envenomed
3815	Shall be as welcome to the ears of Brutus
3816	As tidings of this sight.
3817	
3818	TITINIUS	Hie you, Messala,
3819	And I will seek for Pindarus the while.
3820	
3821	[Exit MESSALA]
3822	
3823	Why didst thou send me forth, brave Cassius?
3824	Did I not meet thy friends? and did not they
3825	Put on my brows this wreath of victory,
3826	And bid me give it thee? Didst thou not hear their shouts?
3827	Alas, thou hast misconstrued every thing!
3828	But, hold thee, take this garland on thy brow;
3829	Thy Brutus bid me give it thee, and I
3830	Will do his bidding. Brutus, come apace,
3831	And see how I regarded Caius Cassius.
3832	By your leave, gods:--this is a Roman's part
3833	Come, Cassius' sword, and find Titinius' heart.
3834	
3835	[Kills himself]
3836	
3837	[Alarum. Re-enter MESSALA, with BRUTUS, CATO,
3838	STRATO, VOLUMNIUS, and LUCILIUS]
3839	
3840	BRUTUS	Where, where, Messala, doth his body lie?
3841	
3842	MESSALA	Lo, yonder, and Titinius mourning it.
3843	
3844	BRUTUS	Titinius' face is upward.
3845	
3846	CATO	He is slain.
3847	
3848	BRUTUS	O Julius Caesar, thou art mighty yet!
3849	Thy spirit walks abroad and turns our swords
3850	In our own proper entrails.
3851	
3852	[Low alarums]
3853	
3854	CATO	Brave Titinius!
3855	Look, whether he have not crown'd dead Cassius!
3856	
3857	BRUTUS	Are yet two Romans living such as these?
3858	The last of all the Romans, fare thee well!
3859	It is impossible that ever Rome
3860	Should breed thy fellow. Friends, I owe more tears
3861	To this dead man than you shall see me pay.
3862	I shall find time, Cassius, I shall find time.
3863	Come, therefore, and to Thasos send his body:
3864	His funerals shall not be in our camp,
3865	Lest it discomfort us. Lucilius, come;
3866	And come, young Cato; let us to the field.
3867	Labeo and Flavius, set our battles on:
3868	'Tis three o'clock; and, Romans, yet ere night
3869	We shall try fortune in a second fight.

3885	
3886	[Alarum. Enter fighting, Soldiers of both armies;
3887	then BRUTUS, CATO, LUCILIUS, and others]
3888	
3889	BRUTUS	Yet, countrymen, O, yet hold up your heads!
3890	
3891	CATO	What bastard doth not? Who will go with me?
3892	I will proclaim my name about the field:
3893	I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
3894	A foe to tyrants, and my country's friend;
3895	I am the son of Marcus Cato, ho!
3896	
3897	BRUTUS	And I am Brutus, Marcus Brutus, I;
3898	Brutus, my country's friend; know me for Brutus!
3899	
3900	[Exit]
3901	
3902	LUCILIUS	O young and noble Cato, art thou down?
3903	Why, now thou diest as bravely as Titinius;
3904	And mayst be honour'd, being Cato's son.
3905	
3906	First Soldier	Yield, or thou diest.
3907	
3908	LUCILIUS	Only I yield to die:
3909	There is so much that thou wilt kill me straight;
3910	
3911	[Offering money]
3912	
3913	Kill Brutus, and be honour'd in his death.
3914	
3915	First Soldier	We must not. A noble prisoner!
3916	
3917	Second Soldier	Room, ho! Tell Antony, Brutus is ta'en.
3918	
3919	First Soldier	I'll tell the news. Here comes the general.
3920	
3921	[Enter ANTONY]
3922	
3923	Brutus is ta'en, Brutus is ta'en, my lord.
3924	
3925	ANTONY	Where is he?
3926	
3927	LUCILIUS	Safe, Antony; Brutus is safe enough:
3928	I dare assure thee that no enemy
3929	Shall ever take alive the noble Brutus:
3930	The gods defend him from so great a shame!
3931	When you do find him, or alive or dead,
3932	He will be found like Brutus, like himself.
3933	
3934	ANTONY	This is not Brutus, friend; but, I assure you,
3935	A prize no less in worth: keep this man safe;
3936	Give him all kindness: I had rather have
3937	Such men my friends than enemies. Go on,
3938	And see whether Brutus be alive or dead;
3939	And bring us word unto Octavius' tent
3940	How every thing is chanced.

3954	SCENE V	Another part of the field.
3955	
3956	
3957	[Enter BRUTUS, DARDANIUS, CLITUS, STRATO, and
3958	VOLUMNIUS]
3959	
3960	BRUTUS	Come, poor remains of friends, rest on this rock.
3961	
3962	CLITUS	Statilius show'd the torch-light, but, my lord,
3963	He came not back: he is or ta'en or slain.
3964	
3965	BRUTUS	Sit thee down, Clitus: slaying is the word;
3966	It is a deed in fashion. Hark thee, Clitus.
3967	
3968	[Whispers]
3969	
3970	CLITUS	What, I, my lord? No, not for all the world.
3971	
3972	BRUTUS	Peace then! no words.
3973	
3974	CLITUS	I'll rather kill myself.
3975	
3976	BRUTUS	Hark thee, Dardanius.
3977	
3978	[Whispers]
3979	
3980	DARDANIUS	Shall I do such a deed?
3981	
3982	CLITUS	O Dardanius!
3983	
3984	DARDANIUS	O Clitus!
3985	
3986	CLITUS	What ill request did Brutus make to thee?
3987	
3988	DARDANIUS	To kill him, Clitus. Look, he meditates.
3989	
3990	CLITUS	Now is that noble vessel full of grief,
3991	That it runs over even at his eyes.
3992	
3993	BRUTUS	Come hither, good Volumnius; list a word.
3994	
3995	VOLUMNIUS	What says my lord?
3996	
3997	BRUTUS	                  Why, this, Volumnius:
3998	The ghost of Caesar hath appear'd to me
3999	Two several times by night; at Sardis once,
4000	And, this last night, here in Philippi fields:
4001	I know my hour is come.
4002	
4003	VOLUMNIUS	Not so, my lord.
4004	
4005	BRUTUS	Nay, I am sure it is, Volumnius.
4006	Thou seest the world, Volumnius, how it goes;
4007	Our enemies have beat us to the pit:
4008	
4009	[Low alarums]
4010	
4011	It is more worthy to leap in ourselves,
4012	Than tarry till they push us. Good Volumnius,
4013	Thou know'st that we two went to school together:
4014	Even for that our love of old, I prithee,
4015	Hold thou my sword-hilts, whilst I run on it.
4016	
4017	VOLUMNIUS	That's not an office for a friend, my lord.
4018	
4019	[Alarum still]
4020	
4021	CLITUS	Fly, fly, my lord; there is no tarrying here.
4022	
4023	BRUTUS	Farewell to you; and you; and you, Volumnius.
4024	Strato, thou hast been all this while asleep;
4025	Farewell to thee too, Strato. Countrymen,
4026	My heart doth joy that yet in all my life
4027	I found no man but he was true to me.
4028	I shall have glory by this losing day
4029	More than Octavius and Mark Antony
4030	By this vile conquest shall attain unto.
4031	So fare you well at once; for Brutus' tongue
4032	Hath almost ended his life's history:
4033	Night hangs upon mine eyes; my bones would rest,
4034	That have but labour'd to attain this hour.
4035	
4036	[Alarum. Cry within, 'Fly, fly, fly!']
4037	
4038	CLITUS	Fly, my lord, fly.
4039	
4040	BRUTUS	                  Hence! I will follow.
4041	
4042	[Exeunt CLITUS, DARDANIUS, and VOLUMNIUS]
4043	
4044	I prithee, Strato, stay thou by thy lord:
4045	Thou art a fellow of a good respect;
4046	Thy life hath had some smatch of honour in it:
4047	Hold then my sword, and turn away thy face,
4048	While I do run upon it. Wilt thou, Strato?
4049	
4050	STRATO	Give me your hand first. Fare you well, my lord.
4051	
4052	BRUTUS	Farewell, good Strato.
4053	
4054	[Runs on his sword]
4055	
4056	Caesar, now be still:
4057	I kill'd not thee with half so good a will.
4058	
4059	[Dies]
4060	
4061	[Alarum. Retreat. Enter OCTAVIUS, ANTONY, MESSALA,
4062	LUCILIUS, and the army]
4063	
4064	OCTAVIUS	What man is that?
4065	
4066	MESSALA	My master's man. Strato, where is thy master?
4067	
4068	STRATO	Free from the bondage you are in, Messala:
4069	The conquerors can but make a fire of him;
4070	For Brutus only overcame himself,
4071	And no man else hath honour by his death.
4072	
4073	LUCILIUS	So Brutus should be found. I thank thee, Brutus,
4074	That thou hast proved Lucilius' saying true.
4075	
4076	OCTAVIUS	All that served Brutus, I will entertain them.
4077	Fellow, wilt thou bestow thy time with me?
4078	
4079	STRATO	Ay, if Messala will prefer me to you.
4080	
4081	OCTAVIUS	Do so, good Messala.
4082	
4083	MESSALA	How died my master, Strato?
4084	
4085	STRATO	I held the sword, and he did run on it.
4086	
4087	MESSALA	Octavius, then take him to follow thee,
4088	That did the latest service to my master.
4089	
4090	ANTONY	This was the noblest Roman of them all:
4091	All the conspirators save only he
4092	Did that they did in envy of great Caesar;
4093	He only, in a general honest thought
4094	And common good to all, made one of them.
4095	His life was gentle, and the elements
4096	So mix'd in him that Nature might stand up
4097	And say to all the world 'This was a man!'
4098	
4099	OCTAVIUS	According to his virtue let us use him,
4100	With all respect and rites of burial.
4101	Within my tent his bones to-night shall lie,
4102	Most like a soldier, order'd honourably.
4103	So call the field to rest; and let's away,
4104	To part the glories of this happy day.
4105	
4106	[Exeunt]

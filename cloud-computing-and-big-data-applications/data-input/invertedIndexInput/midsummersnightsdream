62	
63	
64	ACT I
65	
66	
67	
68	SCENE I	Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
69	
70	
71	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, and
72	Attendants]
73	
74	THESEUS	Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour
75	Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
76	Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
77	This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
78	Like to a step-dame or a dowager
79	Long withering out a young man revenue.
80	
81	HIPPOLYTA	Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;
82	Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
83	And then the moon, like to a silver bow
84	New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
85	Of our solemnities.
86	
87	THESEUS	Go, Philostrate,
88	Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
89	Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
90	Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
91	The pale companion is not for our pomp.
92	
93	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]
94	
95	Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
96	And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
97	But I will wed thee in another key,
98	With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
99	
100	[Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS]
101	
102	EGEUS	Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!
103	
104	THESEUS	Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?
105	
106	EGEUS	Full of vexation come I, with complaint
107	Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
108	Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
109	This man hath my consent to marry her.
110	Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
111	This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
112	Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
113	And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
114	Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
115	With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
116	And stolen the impression of her fantasy
117	With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
118	Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
119	Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
120	With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
121	Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
122	To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
123	Be it so she; will not here before your grace
124	Consent to marry with Demetrius,
125	I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
126	As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
127	Which shall be either to this gentleman
128	Or to her death, according to our law
129	Immediately provided in that case.
130	
131	THESEUS	What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:
132	To you your father should be as a god;
133	One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
134	To whom you are but as a form in wax
135	By him imprinted and within his power
136	To leave the figure or disfigure it.
137	Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
138	
139	HERMIA	So is Lysander.
140	
141	THESEUS	                  In himself he is;
142	But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
143	The other must be held the worthier.
144	
145	HERMIA	I would my father look'd but with my eyes.
146	
147	THESEUS	Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.
148	
149	HERMIA	I do entreat your grace to pardon me.
150	I know not by what power I am made bold,
151	Nor how it may concern my modesty,
152	In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
153	But I beseech your grace that I may know
154	The worst that may befall me in this case,
155	If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
156	
157	THESEUS	Either to die the death or to abjure
158	For ever the society of men.
159	Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
160	Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
161	Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
162	You can endure the livery of a nun,
163	For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
164	To live a barren sister all your life,
165	Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
166	Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
167	To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
168	But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
169	Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
170	Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
171	
172	HERMIA	So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,
173	Ere I will my virgin patent up
174	Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
175	My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
176	
177	THESEUS	Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--
178	The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
179	For everlasting bond of fellowship--
180	Upon that day either prepare to die
181	For disobedience to your father's will,
182	Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
183	Or on Diana's altar to protest
184	For aye austerity and single life.
185	
186	DEMETRIUS	Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield
187	Thy crazed title to my certain right.
188	
189	LYSANDER	You have her father's love, Demetrius;
190	Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
191	
192	EGEUS	Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,
193	And what is mine my love shall render him.
194	And she is mine, and all my right of her
195	I do estate unto Demetrius.
196	
197	LYSANDER	I am, my lord, as well derived as he,
198	As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
199	My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
200	If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
201	And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
202	I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
203	Why should not I then prosecute my right?
204	Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
205	Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
206	And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
207	Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
208	Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
209	
210	THESEUS	I must confess that I have heard so much,
211	And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
212	But, being over-full of self-affairs,
213	My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
214	And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
215	I have some private schooling for you both.
216	For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
217	To fit your fancies to your father's will;
218	Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
219	Which by no means we may extenuate--
220	To death, or to a vow of single life.
221	Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
222	Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
223	I must employ you in some business
224	Against our nuptial and confer with you
225	Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
226	
227	EGEUS	With duty and desire we follow you.
228	
229	[Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA]
230	
231	LYSANDER	How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?
232	How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
233	
234	HERMIA	Belike for want of rain, which I could well
235	Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
236	
237	LYSANDER	Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,
238	Could ever hear by tale or history,
239	The course of true love never did run smooth;
240	But, either it was different in blood,--
241	
242	HERMIA	O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.
243	
244	LYSANDER	Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--
245	
246	HERMIA	O spite! too old to be engaged to young.
247	
248	LYSANDER	Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--
249	
250	HERMIA	O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.
251	
252	LYSANDER	Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,
253	War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
254	Making it momentany as a sound,
255	Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
256	Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
257	That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
258	And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
259	The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
260	So quick bright things come to confusion.
261	
262	HERMIA	If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,
263	It stands as an edict in destiny:
264	Then let us teach our trial patience,
265	Because it is a customary cross,
266	As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
267	Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
268	
269	LYSANDER	A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.
270	I have a widow aunt, a dowager
271	Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
272	From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
273	And she respects me as her only son.
274	There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
275	And to that place the sharp Athenian law
276	Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
277	Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
278	And in the wood, a league without the town,
279	Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
280	To do observance to a morn of May,
281	There will I stay for thee.
282	
283	HERMIA	My good Lysander!
284	I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
285	By his best arrow with the golden head,
286	By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
287	By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
288	And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
289	When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
290	By all the vows that ever men have broke,
291	In number more than ever women spoke,
292	In that same place thou hast appointed me,
293	To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
294	
295	LYSANDER	Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.
296	
297	[Enter HELENA]
298	
299	HERMIA	God speed fair Helena! whither away?
300	
301	HELENA	Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.
302	Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
303	Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
304	More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
305	When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
306	Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
307	Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
308	My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
309	My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
310	Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
311	The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
312	O, teach me how you look, and with what art
313	You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
314	
315	HERMIA	I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.
316	
317	HELENA	O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!
318	
319	HERMIA	I give him curses, yet he gives me love.
320	
321	HELENA	O that my prayers could such affection move!
322	
323	HERMIA	The more I hate, the more he follows me.
324	
325	HELENA	The more I love, the more he hateth me.
326	
327	HERMIA	His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.
328	
329	HELENA	None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!
330	
331	HERMIA	Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;
332	Lysander and myself will fly this place.
333	Before the time I did Lysander see,
334	Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
335	O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
336	That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
337	
338	LYSANDER	Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:
339	To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
340	Her silver visage in the watery glass,
341	Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
342	A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
343	Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
344	
345	HERMIA	And in the wood, where often you and I
346	Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
347	Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
348	There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
349	And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
350	To seek new friends and stranger companies.
351	Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
352	And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
353	Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
354	From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
355	
356	LYSANDER	I will, my Hermia.
357	
358	[Exit HERMIA]
359	
360	Helena, adieu:
361	As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
362	
363	[Exit]
364	
365	HELENA	How happy some o'er other some can be!
366	Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
367	But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
368	He will not know what all but he do know:
369	And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
370	So I, admiring of his qualities:
371	Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
372	Love can transpose to form and dignity:
373	Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
374	And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
375	Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
376	Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
377	And therefore is Love said to be a child,
378	Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
379	As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
380	So the boy Love is perjured every where:
381	For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
382	He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
383	And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
384	So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
385	I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
386	Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
387	Pursue her; and for this intelligence
388	If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
389	But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
390	To have his sight thither and back again.
391	
392	[Exit]

398	
399	
400	ACT I
401	
402	
403	
404	SCENE II	Athens. QUINCE'S house.
405	
406	
407	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
408	STARVELING]
409	
410	QUINCE	Is all our company here?
411	
412	BOTTOM	You were best to call them generally, man by man,
413	according to the scrip.
414	
415	QUINCE	Here is the scroll of every man's name, which is
416	thought fit, through all Athens, to play in our
417	interlude before the duke and the duchess, on his
418	wedding-day at night.
419	
420	BOTTOM	First, good Peter Quince, say what the play treats
421	on, then read the names of the actors, and so grow
422	to a point.
423	
424	QUINCE	Marry, our play is, The most lamentable comedy, and
425	most cruel death of Pyramus and Thisby.
426	
427	BOTTOM	A very good piece of work, I assure you, and a
428	merry. Now, good Peter Quince, call forth your
429	actors by the scroll. Masters, spread yourselves.
430	
431	QUINCE	Answer as I call you. Nick Bottom, the weaver.
432	
433	BOTTOM	Ready. Name what part I am for, and proceed.
434	
435	QUINCE	You, Nick Bottom, are set down for Pyramus.
436	
437	BOTTOM	What is Pyramus? a lover, or a tyrant?
438	
439	QUINCE	A lover, that kills himself most gallant for love.
440	
441	BOTTOM	That will ask some tears in the true performing of
442	it: if I do it, let the audience look to their
443	eyes; I will move storms, I will condole in some
444	measure. To the rest: yet my chief humour is for a
445	tyrant: I could play Ercles rarely, or a part to
446	tear a cat in, to make all split.
447	The raging rocks
448	And shivering shocks
449	Shall break the locks
450	Of prison gates;
451	And Phibbus' car
452	Shall shine from far
453	And make and mar
454	The foolish Fates.
455	This was lofty! Now name the rest of the players.
456	This is Ercles' vein, a tyrant's vein; a lover is
457	more condoling.
458	
459	QUINCE	Francis Flute, the bellows-mender.
460	
461	FLUTE	Here, Peter Quince.
462	
463	QUINCE	Flute, you must take Thisby on you.
464	
465	FLUTE	What is Thisby? a wandering knight?
466	
467	QUINCE	It is the lady that Pyramus must love.
468	
469	FLUTE	Nay, faith, let me not play a woman; I have a beard coming.
470	
471	QUINCE	That's all one: you shall play it in a mask, and
472	you may speak as small as you will.
473	
474	BOTTOM	An I may hide my face, let me play Thisby too, I'll
475	speak in a monstrous little voice. 'Thisne,
476	Thisne;' 'Ah, Pyramus, lover dear! thy Thisby dear,
477	and lady dear!'
478	
479	QUINCE	No, no; you must play Pyramus: and, Flute, you Thisby.
480	
481	BOTTOM	Well, proceed.
482	
483	QUINCE	Robin Starveling, the tailor.
484	
485	STARVELING	Here, Peter Quince.
486	
487	QUINCE	Robin Starveling, you must play Thisby's mother.
488	Tom Snout, the tinker.
489	
490	SNOUT	Here, Peter Quince.
491	
492	QUINCE	You, Pyramus' father: myself, Thisby's father:
493	Snug, the joiner; you, the lion's part: and, I
494	hope, here is a play fitted.
495	
496	SNUG	Have you the lion's part written? pray you, if it
497	be, give it me, for I am slow of study.
498	
499	QUINCE	You may do it extempore, for it is nothing but roaring.
500	
501	BOTTOM	Let me play the lion too: I will roar, that I will
502	do any man's heart good to hear me; I will roar,
503	that I will make the duke say 'Let him roar again,
504	let him roar again.'
505	
506	QUINCE	An you should do it too terribly, you would fright
507	the duchess and the ladies, that they would shriek;
508	and that were enough to hang us all.
509	
510	ALL	That would hang us, every mother's son.
511	
512	BOTTOM	I grant you, friends, if that you should fright the
513	ladies out of their wits, they would have no more
514	discretion but to hang us: but I will aggravate my
515	voice so that I will roar you as gently as any
516	sucking dove; I will roar you an 'twere any
517	nightingale.
518	
519	QUINCE	You can play no part but Pyramus; for Pyramus is a
520	sweet-faced man; a proper man, as one shall see in a
521	summer's day; a most lovely gentleman-like man:
522	therefore you must needs play Pyramus.
523	
524	BOTTOM	Well, I will undertake it. What beard were I best
525	to play it in?
526	
527	QUINCE	Why, what you will.
528	
529	BOTTOM	I will discharge it in either your straw-colour
530	beard, your orange-tawny beard, your purple-in-grain
531	beard, or your French-crown-colour beard, your
532	perfect yellow.
533	
534	QUINCE	Some of your French crowns have no hair at all, and
535	then you will play bare-faced. But, masters, here
536	are your parts: and I am to entreat you, request
537	you and desire you, to con them by to-morrow night;
538	and meet me in the palace wood, a mile without the
539	town, by moonlight; there will we rehearse, for if
540	we meet in the city, we shall be dogged with
541	company, and our devices known. In the meantime I
542	will draw a bill of properties, such as our play
543	wants. I pray you, fail me not.
544	
545	BOTTOM	We will meet; and there we may rehearse most
546	obscenely and courageously. Take pains; be perfect: adieu.
547	
548	QUINCE	At the duke's oak we meet.
549	
550	BOTTOM	Enough; hold or cut bow-strings.
551

569	PUCK	How now, spirit! whither wander you?
570	
571	Fairy	     Over hill, over dale,
572	Thorough bush, thorough brier,
573	Over park, over pale,
574	Thorough flood, thorough fire,
575	I do wander everywhere,
576	Swifter than the moon's sphere;
577	And I serve the fairy queen,
578	To dew her orbs upon the green.
579	The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
580	In their gold coats spots you see;
581	Those be rubies, fairy favours,
582	In those freckles live their savours:
583	I must go seek some dewdrops here
584	And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
585	Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
586	Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
587	
588	PUCK	The king doth keep his revels here to-night:
589	Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
590	For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
591	Because that she as her attendant hath
592	A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
593	She never had so sweet a changeling;
594	And jealous Oberon would have the child
595	Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
596	But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
597	Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
598	And now they never meet in grove or green,
599	By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
600	But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
601	Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
602	
603	Fairy	Either I mistake your shape and making quite,
604	Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
605	Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
606	That frights the maidens of the villagery;
607	Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
608	And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
609	And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
610	Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
611	Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
612	You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
613	Are not you he?
614	
615	PUCK	                  Thou speak'st aright;
616	I am that merry wanderer of the night.
617	I jest to Oberon and make him smile
618	When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
619	Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
620	And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
621	In very likeness of a roasted crab,
622	And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
623	And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
624	The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
625	Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
626	Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
627	And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
628	And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
629	And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
630	A merrier hour was never wasted there.
631	But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
632	
633	Fairy	And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!
634	
635	[Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train;
636	from the other, TITANIA, with hers]
637	
638	OBERON	Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.
639	
640	TITANIA	What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:
641	I have forsworn his bed and company.
642	
643	OBERON	Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?
644	
645	TITANIA	Then I must be thy lady: but I know
646	When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
647	And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
648	Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
649	To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
650	Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
651	But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
652	Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
653	To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
654	To give their bed joy and prosperity.
655	
656	OBERON	How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,
657	Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
658	Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
659	Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
660	From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
661	And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
662	With Ariadne and Antiopa?
663	
664	TITANIA	These are the forgeries of jealousy:
665	And never, since the middle summer's spring,
666	Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
667	By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
668	Or in the beached margent of the sea,
669	To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
670	But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
671	Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
672	As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
673	Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
674	Have every pelting river made so proud
675	That they have overborne their continents:
676	The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
677	The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
678	Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
679	The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
680	And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
681	The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
682	And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
683	For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
684	The human mortals want their winter here;
685	No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
686	Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
687	Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
688	That rheumatic diseases do abound:
689	And thorough this distemperature we see
690	The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
691	Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
692	And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
693	An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
694	Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
695	The childing autumn, angry winter, change
696	Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
697	By their increase, now knows not which is which:
698	And this same progeny of evils comes
699	From our debate, from our dissension;
700	We are their parents and original.
701	
702	OBERON	Do you amend it then; it lies in you:
703	Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
704	I do but beg a little changeling boy,
705	To be my henchman.
706	
707	TITANIA	                  Set your heart at rest:
708	The fairy land buys not the child of me.
709	His mother was a votaress of my order:
710	And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
711	Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
712	And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
713	Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
714	When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
715	And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
716	Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
717	Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
718	Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
719	To fetch me trifles, and return again,
720	As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
721	But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
722	And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
723	And for her sake I will not part with him.
724	
725	OBERON	How long within this wood intend you stay?
726	
727	TITANIA	Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.
728	If you will patiently dance in our round
729	And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
730	If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
731	
732	OBERON	Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.
733	
734	TITANIA	Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!
735	We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
736	
737	[Exit TITANIA with her train]
738	
739	OBERON	Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove
740	Till I torment thee for this injury.
741	My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
742	Since once I sat upon a promontory,
743	And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
744	Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
745	That the rude sea grew civil at her song
746	And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
747	To hear the sea-maid's music.
748	
749	PUCK	I remember.
750	
751	OBERON	That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,
752	Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
753	Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
754	At a fair vestal throned by the west,
755	And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
756	As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
757	But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
758	Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
759	And the imperial votaress passed on,
760	In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
761	Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
762	It fell upon a little western flower,
763	Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
764	And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
765	Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
766	The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
767	Will make or man or woman madly dote
768	Upon the next live creature that it sees.
769	Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
770	Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
771	
772	PUCK	I'll put a girdle round about the earth
773	In forty minutes.
774	
775	[Exit]
776	
777	OBERON	                  Having once this juice,
778	I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
779	And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
780	The next thing then she waking looks upon,
781	Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
782	On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
783	She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
784	And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
785	As I can take it with another herb,
786	I'll make her render up her page to me.
787	But who comes here? I am invisible;
788	And I will overhear their conference.
789	
790	[Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him]
791	
792	DEMETRIUS	I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.
793	Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
794	The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
795	Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
796	And here am I, and wode within this wood,
797	Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
798	Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
799	
800	HELENA	You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;
801	But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
802	Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
803	And I shall have no power to follow you.
804	
805	DEMETRIUS	Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?
806	Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
807	Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
808	
809	HELENA	And even for that do I love you the more.
810	I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
811	The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
812	Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
813	Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
814	Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
815	What worser place can I beg in your love,--
816	And yet a place of high respect with me,--
817	Than to be used as you use your dog?
818	
819	DEMETRIUS	Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;
820	For I am sick when I do look on thee.
821	
822	HELENA	And I am sick when I look not on you.
823	
824	DEMETRIUS	You do impeach your modesty too much,
825	To leave the city and commit yourself
826	Into the hands of one that loves you not;
827	To trust the opportunity of night
828	And the ill counsel of a desert place
829	With the rich worth of your virginity.
830	
831	HELENA	Your virtue is my privilege: for that
832	It is not night when I do see your face,
833	Therefore I think I am not in the night;
834	Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
835	For you in my respect are all the world:
836	Then how can it be said I am alone,
837	When all the world is here to look on me?
838	
839	DEMETRIUS	I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,
840	And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
841	
842	HELENA	The wildest hath not such a heart as you.
843	Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
844	Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
845	The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
846	Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
847	When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
848	
849	DEMETRIUS	I will not stay thy questions; let me go:
850	Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
851	But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
852	
853	HELENA	Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,
854	You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
855	Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
856	We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
857	We should be wood and were not made to woo.
858	
859	[Exit DEMETRIUS]
860	
861	I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
862	To die upon the hand I love so well.
863	
864	[Exit]
865	
866	OBERON	Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,
867	Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
868	
869	[Re-enter PUCK]
870	
871	Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
872	
873	PUCK	Ay, there it is.
874	
875	OBERON	I pray thee, give it me.
876	I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
877	Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
878	Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
879	With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
880	There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
881	Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
882	And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
883	Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
884	And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
885	And make her full of hateful fantasies.
886	Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
887	A sweet Athenian lady is in love
888	With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
889	But do it when the next thing he espies
890	May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
891	By the Athenian garments he hath on.
892	Effect it with some care, that he may prove
893	More fond on her than she upon her love:
894	And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
895	
896	PUCK	Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.
897	
898	[Exeunt]

903	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
904	
905	
906	ACT II
907	
908	
909	
910	SCENE II	Another part of the wood.
911	
912	
913	[Enter TITANIA, with her train]
914	
915	TITANIA	Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;
916	Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
917	Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
918	Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
919	To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
920	The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
921	At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
922	Then to your offices and let me rest.
923	
924	[The Fairies sing]
925	
926	You spotted snakes with double tongue,
927	Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
928	Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
929	Come not near our fairy queen.
930	Philomel, with melody
931	Sing in our sweet lullaby;
932	Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
933	Never harm,
934	Nor spell nor charm,
935	Come our lovely lady nigh;
936	So, good night, with lullaby.
937	Weaving spiders, come not here;
938	Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
939	Beetles black, approach not near;
940	Worm nor snail, do no offence.
941	Philomel, with melody, &c.
942	
943	Fairy	Hence, away! now all is well:
944	One aloof stand sentinel.
945	
946	[Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps]
947	
948	[Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids]
949	
950	OBERON	What thou seest when thou dost wake,
951	Do it for thy true-love take,
952	Love and languish for his sake:
953	Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
954	Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
955	In thy eye that shall appear
956	When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
957	Wake when some vile thing is near.
958	
959	[Exit]
960	
961	[Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA]
962	
963	LYSANDER	Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;
964	And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
965	We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
966	And tarry for the comfort of the day.
967	
968	HERMIA	Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;
969	For I upon this bank will rest my head.
970	
971	LYSANDER	One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;
972	One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
973	
974	HERMIA	Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,
975	Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
976	
977	LYSANDER	O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!
978	Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
979	I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
980	So that but one heart we can make of it;
981	Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
982	So then two bosoms and a single troth.
983	Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
984	For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
985	
986	HERMIA	Lysander riddles very prettily:
987	Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
988	If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
989	But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
990	Lie further off; in human modesty,
991	Such separation as may well be said
992	Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
993	So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
994	Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
995	
996	LYSANDER	Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;
997	And then end life when I end loyalty!
998	Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
999	
1000	HERMIA	With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!
1001	
1002	[They sleep]
1003	
1004	[Enter PUCK]
1005	
1006	PUCK	Through the forest have I gone.
1007	But Athenian found I none,
1008	On whose eyes I might approve
1009	This flower's force in stirring love.
1010	Night and silence.--Who is here?
1011	Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
1012	This is he, my master said,
1013	Despised the Athenian maid;
1014	And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
1015	On the dank and dirty ground.
1016	Pretty soul! she durst not lie
1017	Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
1018	Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
1019	All the power this charm doth owe.
1020	When thou wakest, let love forbid
1021	Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
1022	So awake when I am gone;
1023	For I must now to Oberon.
1024	
1025	[Exit]
1026	
1027	[Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running]
1028	
1029	HELENA	Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.
1030	
1031	DEMETRIUS	I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.
1032	
1033	HELENA	O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.
1034	
1035	DEMETRIUS	Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.
1036	
1037	[Exit]
1038	
1039	HELENA	O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!
1040	The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
1041	Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
1042	For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
1043	How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
1044	If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
1045	No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
1046	For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
1047	Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
1048	Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
1049	What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
1050	Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
1051	But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
1052	Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
1053	Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
1054	
1055	LYSANDER	[Awaking]  And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.
1056	Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
1057	That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
1058	Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
1059	Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
1060	
1061	HELENA	Do not say so, Lysander; say not so
1062	What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
1063	Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
1064	
1065	LYSANDER	Content with Hermia! No; I do repent
1066	The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
1067	Not Hermia but Helena I love:
1068	Who will not change a raven for a dove?
1069	The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
1070	And reason says you are the worthier maid.
1071	Things growing are not ripe until their season
1072	So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
1073	And touching now the point of human skill,
1074	Reason becomes the marshal to my will
1075	And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
1076	Love's stories written in love's richest book.
1077	
1078	HELENA	Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?
1079	When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
1080	Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
1081	That I did never, no, nor never can,
1082	Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
1083	But you must flout my insufficiency?
1084	Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
1085	In such disdainful manner me to woo.
1086	But fare you well: perforce I must confess
1087	I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
1088	O, that a lady, of one man refused.
1089	Should of another therefore be abused!
1090	
1091	[Exit]
1092	
1093	LYSANDER	She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:
1094	And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
1095	For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
1096	The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
1097	Or as tie heresies that men do leave
1098	Are hated most of those they did deceive,
1099	So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
1100	Of all be hated, but the most of me!
1101	And, all my powers, address your love and might
1102	To honour Helen and to be her knight!
1103	
1104	[Exit]
1105	
1106	HERMIA	[Awaking]  Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best
1107	To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
1108	Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
1109	Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
1110	Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
1111	And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
1112	Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
1113	What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
1114	Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
1115	Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
1116	No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
1117	Either death or you I'll find immediately.
1118	
1119	[Exit]

1124	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
1125	
1126	
1127	ACT III
1128	
1129	
1130	
1131	SCENE I	The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.
1132	
1133	
1134	[Enter QUINCE, SNUG, BOTTOM, FLUTE, SNOUT, and
1135	STARVELING]
1136	
1137	BOTTOM	Are we all met?
1138	
1139	QUINCE	Pat, pat; and here's a marvellous convenient place
1140	for our rehearsal. This green plot shall be our
1141	stage, this hawthorn-brake our tiring-house; and we
1142	will do it in action as we will do it before the duke.
1143	
1144	BOTTOM	Peter Quince,--
1145	
1146	QUINCE	What sayest thou, bully Bottom?
1147	
1148	BOTTOM	There are things in this comedy of Pyramus and
1149	Thisby that will never please. First, Pyramus must
1150	draw a sword to kill himself; which the ladies
1151	cannot abide. How answer you that?
1152	
1153	SNOUT	By'r lakin, a parlous fear.
1154	
1155	STARVELING	I believe we must leave the killing out, when all is done.
1156	
1157	BOTTOM	Not a whit: I have a device to make all well.
1158	Write me a prologue; and let the prologue seem to
1159	say, we will do no harm with our swords, and that
1160	Pyramus is not killed indeed; and, for the more
1161	better assurance, tell them that I, Pyramus, am not
1162	Pyramus, but Bottom the weaver: this will put them
1163	out of fear.
1164	
1165	QUINCE	Well, we will have such a prologue; and it shall be
1166	written in eight and six.
1167	
1168	BOTTOM	No, make it two more; let it be written in eight and eight.
1169	
1170	SNOUT	Will not the ladies be afeard of the lion?
1171	
1172	STARVELING	I fear it, I promise you.
1173	
1174	BOTTOM	Masters, you ought to consider with yourselves: to
1175	bring in--God shield us!--a lion among ladies, is a
1176	most dreadful thing; for there is not a more fearful
1177	wild-fowl than your lion living; and we ought to
1178	look to 't.
1179	
1180	SNOUT	Therefore another prologue must tell he is not a lion.
1181	
1182	BOTTOM	Nay, you must name his name, and half his face must
1183	be seen through the lion's neck: and he himself
1184	must speak through, saying thus, or to the same
1185	defect,--'Ladies,'--or 'Fair-ladies--I would wish
1186	You,'--or 'I would request you,'--or 'I would
1187	entreat you,--not to fear, not to tremble: my life
1188	for yours. If you think I come hither as a lion, it
1189	were pity of my life: no I am no such thing; I am a
1190	man as other men are;' and there indeed let him name
1191	his name, and tell them plainly he is Snug the joiner.
1192	
1193	QUINCE	Well it shall be so. But there is two hard things;
1194	that is, to bring the moonlight into a chamber; for,
1195	you know, Pyramus and Thisby meet by moonlight.
1196	
1197	SNOUT	Doth the moon shine that night we play our play?
1198	
1199	BOTTOM	A calendar, a calendar! look in the almanac; find
1200	out moonshine, find out moonshine.
1201	
1202	QUINCE	Yes, it doth shine that night.
1203	
1204	BOTTOM	Why, then may you leave a casement of the great
1205	chamber window, where we play, open, and the moon
1206	may shine in at the casement.
1207	
1208	QUINCE	Ay; or else one must come in with a bush of thorns
1209	and a lanthorn, and say he comes to disfigure, or to
1210	present, the person of Moonshine. Then, there is
1211	another thing: we must have a wall in the great
1212	chamber; for Pyramus and Thisby says the story, did
1213	talk through the chink of a wall.
1214	
1215	SNOUT	You can never bring in a wall. What say you, Bottom?
1216	
1217	BOTTOM	Some man or other must present Wall: and let him
1218	have some plaster, or some loam, or some rough-cast
1219	about him, to signify wall; and let him hold his
1220	fingers thus, and through that cranny shall Pyramus
1221	and Thisby whisper.
1222	
1223	QUINCE	If that may be, then all is well. Come, sit down,
1224	every mother's son, and rehearse your parts.
1225	Pyramus, you begin: when you have spoken your
1226	speech, enter into that brake: and so every one
1227	according to his cue.
1228	
1229	[Enter PUCK behind]
1230	
1231	PUCK	What hempen home-spuns have we swaggering here,
1232	So near the cradle of the fairy queen?
1233	What, a play toward! I'll be an auditor;
1234	An actor too, perhaps, if I see cause.
1235	
1236	QUINCE	Speak, Pyramus. Thisby, stand forth.
1237	
1238	BOTTOM	Thisby, the flowers of odious savours sweet,--
1239	
1240	QUINCE	Odours, odours.
1241	
1242	BOTTOM	--odours savours sweet:
1243	So hath thy breath, my dearest Thisby dear.
1244	But hark, a voice! stay thou but here awhile,
1245	And by and by I will to thee appear.
1246	
1247	[Exit]
1248	
1249	PUCK	A stranger Pyramus than e'er played here.
1250	
1251	[Exit]
1252	
1253	FLUTE	Must I speak now?
1254	
1255	QUINCE	Ay, marry, must you; for you must understand he goes
1256	but to see a noise that he heard, and is to come again.
1257	
1258	FLUTE	Most radiant Pyramus, most lily-white of hue,
1259	Of colour like the red rose on triumphant brier,
1260	Most brisky juvenal and eke most lovely Jew,
1261	As true as truest horse that yet would never tire,
1262	I'll meet thee, Pyramus, at Ninny's tomb.
1263	
1264	QUINCE	'Ninus' tomb,' man: why, you must not speak that
1265	yet; that you answer to Pyramus: you speak all your
1266	part at once, cues and all Pyramus enter: your cue
1267	is past; it is, 'never tire.'
1268	
1269	FLUTE	O,--As true as truest horse, that yet would
1270	never tire.
1271	
1272	[Re-enter PUCK, and BOTTOM with an ass's head]
1273	
1274	BOTTOM	If I were fair, Thisby, I were only thine.
1275	
1276	QUINCE	O monstrous! O strange! we are haunted. Pray,
1277	masters! fly, masters! Help!
1278	
1279	[Exeunt QUINCE, SNUG, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING]
1280	
1281	PUCK	I'll follow you, I'll lead you about a round,
1282	Through bog, through bush, through brake, through brier:
1283	Sometime a horse I'll be, sometime a hound,
1284	A hog, a headless bear, sometime a fire;
1285	And neigh, and bark, and grunt, and roar, and burn,
1286	Like horse, hound, hog, bear, fire, at every turn.
1287	
1288	[Exit]
1289	
1290	BOTTOM	Why do they run away? this is a knavery of them to
1291	make me afeard.
1292	
1293	[Re-enter SNOUT]
1294	
1295	SNOUT	O Bottom, thou art changed! what do I see on thee?
1296	
1297	BOTTOM	What do you see? you see an asshead of your own, do
1298	you?
1299	
1300	[Exit SNOUT]
1301	
1302	[Re-enter QUINCE]
1303	
1304	QUINCE	Bless thee, Bottom! bless thee! thou art
1305	translated.
1306	
1307	[Exit]
1308	
1309	BOTTOM	I see their knavery: this is to make an ass of me;
1310	to fright me, if they could. But I will not stir
1311	from this place, do what they can: I will walk up
1312	and down here, and I will sing, that they shall hear
1313	I am not afraid.
1314	
1315	[Sings]
1316	
1317	The ousel cock so black of hue,
1318	With orange-tawny bill,
1319	The throstle with his note so true,
1320	The wren with little quill,--
1321	
1322	TITANIA	[Awaking]  What angel wakes me from my flowery bed?
1323	
1324	BOTTOM	[Sings]
1325	
1326	The finch, the sparrow and the lark,
1327	The plain-song cuckoo gray,
1328	Whose note full many a man doth mark,
1329	And dares not answer nay;--
1330	for, indeed, who would set his wit to so foolish
1331	a bird? who would give a bird the lie, though he cry
1332	'cuckoo' never so?
1333	
1334	TITANIA	I pray thee, gentle mortal, sing again:
1335	Mine ear is much enamour'd of thy note;
1336	So is mine eye enthralled to thy shape;
1337	And thy fair virtue's force perforce doth move me
1338	On the first view to say, to swear, I love thee.
1339	
1340	BOTTOM	Methinks, mistress, you should have little reason
1341	for that: and yet, to say the truth, reason and
1342	love keep little company together now-a-days; the
1343	more the pity that some honest neighbours will not
1344	make them friends. Nay, I can gleek upon occasion.
1345	
1346	TITANIA	Thou art as wise as thou art beautiful.
1347	
1348	BOTTOM	Not so, neither: but if I had wit enough to get out
1349	of this wood, I have enough to serve mine own turn.
1350	
1351	TITANIA	Out of this wood do not desire to go:
1352	Thou shalt remain here, whether thou wilt or no.
1353	I am a spirit of no common rate;
1354	The summer still doth tend upon my state;
1355	And I do love thee: therefore, go with me;
1356	I'll give thee fairies to attend on thee,
1357	And they shall fetch thee jewels from the deep,
1358	And sing while thou on pressed flowers dost sleep;
1359	And I will purge thy mortal grossness so
1360	That thou shalt like an airy spirit go.
1361	Peaseblossom! Cobweb! Moth! and Mustardseed!
1362	
1363	[Enter PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, and MUSTARDSEED]
1364	
1365	PEASEBLOSSOM	Ready.
1366	
1367	COBWEB	     And I.
1368	
1369	MOTH	          And I.
1370	
1371	MUSTARDSEED	                  And I.
1372	
1373	ALL	Where shall we go?
1374	
1375	TITANIA	Be kind and courteous to this gentleman;
1376	Hop in his walks and gambol in his eyes;
1377	Feed him with apricocks and dewberries,
1378	With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;
1379	The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
1380	And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
1381	And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
1382	To have my love to bed and to arise;
1383	And pluck the wings from Painted butterflies
1384	To fan the moonbeams from his sleeping eyes:
1385	Nod to him, elves, and do him courtesies.
1386	
1387	PEASEBLOSSOM	Hail, mortal!
1388	
1389	COBWEB	Hail!
1390	
1391	MOTH	Hail!
1392	
1393	MUSTARDSEED	Hail!
1394	
1395	BOTTOM	I cry your worship's mercy, heartily: I beseech your
1396	worship's name.
1397	
1398	COBWEB	Cobweb.
1399	
1400	BOTTOM	I shall desire you of more acquaintance, good Master
1401	Cobweb: if I cut my finger, I shall make bold with
1402	you. Your name, honest gentleman?
1403	
1404	PEASEBLOSSOM	Peaseblossom.
1405	
1406	BOTTOM	I pray you, commend me to Mistress Squash, your
1407	mother, and to Master Peascod, your father. Good
1408	Master Peaseblossom, I shall desire you of more
1409	acquaintance too. Your name, I beseech you, sir?
1410	
1411	MUSTARDSEED	Mustardseed.
1412	
1413	BOTTOM	Good Master Mustardseed, I know your patience well:
1414	that same cowardly, giant-like ox-beef hath
1415	devoured many a gentleman of your house: I promise
1416	you your kindred had made my eyes water ere now. I
1417	desire your more acquaintance, good Master
1418	Mustardseed.
1419	
1420	TITANIA	Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.
1421	The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
1422	And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
1423	Lamenting some enforced chastity.
1424	Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
1425	
1426	[Exeunt]
1427	
1428	
1429	
1430	
1431	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
1432	
1433	
1434	ACT III
1435	
1436	
1437	
1438	SCENE II	Another part of the wood.
1439	
1440	
1441	[Enter OBERON]
1442	
1443	OBERON	I wonder if Titania be awaked;
1444	Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
1445	Which she must dote on in extremity.
1446	
1447	[Enter PUCK]
1448	
1449	Here comes my messenger.
1450	How now, mad spirit!
1451	What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
1452	
1453	PUCK	My mistress with a monster is in love.
1454	Near to her close and consecrated bower,
1455	While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
1456	A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
1457	That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
1458	Were met together to rehearse a play
1459	Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
1460	The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
1461	Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
1462	Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
1463	When I did him at this advantage take,
1464	An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
1465	Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
1466	And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
1467	As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
1468	Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
1469	Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
1470	Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
1471	So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
1472	And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
1473	He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
1474	Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
1475	thus strong,
1476	Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
1477	For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
1478	Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
1479	things catch.
1480	I led them on in this distracted fear,
1481	And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
1482	When in that moment, so it came to pass,
1483	Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
1484	
1485	OBERON	This falls out better than I could devise.
1486	But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
1487	With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
1488	
1489	PUCK	I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--
1490	And the Athenian woman by his side:
1491	That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
1492	
1493	[Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS]
1494	
1495	OBERON	Stand close: this is the same Athenian.
1496	
1497	PUCK	This is the woman, but not this the man.
1498	
1499	DEMETRIUS	O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?
1500	Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
1501	
1502	HERMIA	Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,
1503	For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
1504	If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
1505	Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
1506	And kill me too.
1507	The sun was not so true unto the day
1508	As he to me: would he have stolen away
1509	From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
1510	This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
1511	May through the centre creep and so displease
1512	Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
1513	It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
1514	So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
1515	
1516	DEMETRIUS	So should the murder'd look, and so should I,
1517	Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
1518	Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
1519	As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
1520	
1521	HERMIA	What's this to my Lysander? where is he?
1522	Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
1523	
1524	DEMETRIUS	I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.
1525	
1526	HERMIA	Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds
1527	Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
1528	Henceforth be never number'd among men!
1529	O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
1530	Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
1531	And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
1532	Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
1533	An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
1534	Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
1535	
1536	DEMETRIUS	You spend your passion on a misprised mood:
1537	I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
1538	Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
1539	
1540	HERMIA	I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.
1541	
1542	DEMETRIUS	An if I could, what should I get therefore?
1543	
1544	HERMIA	A privilege never to see me more.
1545	And from thy hated presence part I so:
1546	See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
1547	
1548	[Exit]
1549	
1550	DEMETRIUS	There is no following her in this fierce vein:
1551	Here therefore for a while I will remain.
1552	So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
1553	For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
1554	Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
1555	If for his tender here I make some stay.
1556	
1557	[Lies down and sleeps]
1558	
1559	OBERON	What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite
1560	And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
1561	Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
1562	Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
1563	
1564	PUCK	Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,
1565	A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
1566	
1567	OBERON	About the wood go swifter than the wind,
1568	And Helena of Athens look thou find:
1569	All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
1570	With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
1571	By some illusion see thou bring her here:
1572	I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
1573	
1574	PUCK	I go, I go; look how I go,
1575	Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
1576	
1577	[Exit]
1578	
1579	OBERON	   Flower of this purple dye,
1580	Hit with Cupid's archery,
1581	Sink in apple of his eye.
1582	When his love he doth espy,
1583	Let her shine as gloriously
1584	As the Venus of the sky.
1585	When thou wakest, if she be by,
1586	Beg of her for remedy.
1587	
1588	[Re-enter PUCK]
1589	
1590	PUCK	   Captain of our fairy band,
1591	Helena is here at hand;
1592	And the youth, mistook by me,
1593	Pleading for a lover's fee.
1594	Shall we their fond pageant see?
1595	Lord, what fools these mortals be!
1596	
1597	OBERON	Stand aside: the noise they make
1598	Will cause Demetrius to awake.
1599	
1600	PUCK	Then will two at once woo one;
1601	That must needs be sport alone;
1602	And those things do best please me
1603	That befal preposterously.
1604	
1605	[Enter LYSANDER and HELENA]
1606	
1607	LYSANDER	Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?
1608	Scorn and derision never come in tears:
1609	Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
1610	In their nativity all truth appears.
1611	How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
1612	Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
1613	
1614	HELENA	You do advance your cunning more and more.
1615	When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
1616	These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
1617	Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
1618	Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
1619	Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
1620	
1621	LYSANDER	I had no judgment when to her I swore.
1622	
1623	HELENA	Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.
1624	
1625	LYSANDER	Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.
1626	
1627	DEMETRIUS	[Awaking]  O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!
1628	To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
1629	Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
1630	Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
1631	That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
1632	Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
1633	When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
1634	This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
1635	
1636	HELENA	O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent
1637	To set against me for your merriment:
1638	If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
1639	You would not do me thus much injury.
1640	Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
1641	But you must join in souls to mock me too?
1642	If you were men, as men you are in show,
1643	You would not use a gentle lady so;
1644	To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
1645	When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
1646	You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
1647	And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
1648	A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
1649	To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
1650	With your derision! none of noble sort
1651	Would so offend a virgin, and extort
1652	A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
1653	
1654	LYSANDER	You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;
1655	For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
1656	And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
1657	In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
1658	And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
1659	Whom I do love and will do till my death.
1660	
1661	HELENA	Never did mockers waste more idle breath.
1662	
1663	DEMETRIUS	Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:
1664	If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
1665	My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
1666	And now to Helen is it home return'd,
1667	There to remain.
1668	
1669	LYSANDER	                  Helen, it is not so.
1670	
1671	DEMETRIUS	Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,
1672	Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
1673	Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
1674	
1675	[Re-enter HERMIA]
1676	
1677	HERMIA	Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,
1678	The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
1679	Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
1680	It pays the hearing double recompense.
1681	Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
1682	Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
1683	But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
1684	
1685	LYSANDER	Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?
1686	
1687	HERMIA	What love could press Lysander from my side?
1688	
1689	LYSANDER	Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,
1690	Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
1691	Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
1692	Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
1693	The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
1694	
1695	HERMIA	You speak not as you think: it cannot be.
1696	
1697	HELENA	Lo, she is one of this confederacy!
1698	Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
1699	To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
1700	Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
1701	Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
1702	To bait me with this foul derision?
1703	Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
1704	The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
1705	When we have chid the hasty-footed time
1706	For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
1707	All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
1708	We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
1709	Have with our needles created both one flower,
1710	Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
1711	Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
1712	As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
1713	Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
1714	Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
1715	But yet an union in partition;
1716	Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
1717	So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
1718	Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
1719	Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
1720	And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
1721	To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
1722	It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
1723	Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
1724	Though I alone do feel the injury.
1725	
1726	HERMIA	I am amazed at your passionate words.
1727	I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
1728	
1729	HELENA	Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,
1730	To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
1731	And made your other love, Demetrius,
1732	Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
1733	To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
1734	Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
1735	To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
1736	Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
1737	And tender me, forsooth, affection,
1738	But by your setting on, by your consent?
1739	What thought I be not so in grace as you,
1740	So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
1741	But miserable most, to love unloved?
1742	This you should pity rather than despise.
1743	
1744	HERNIA	I understand not what you mean by this.
1745	
1746	HELENA	Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,
1747	Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
1748	Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
1749	This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
1750	If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
1751	You would not make me such an argument.
1752	But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
1753	Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
1754	
1755	LYSANDER	Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:
1756	My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!
1757	
1758	HELENA	O excellent!
1759	
1760	HERMIA	                  Sweet, do not scorn her so.
1761	
1762	DEMETRIUS	If she cannot entreat, I can compel.
1763	
1764	LYSANDER	Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:
1765	Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
1766	Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
1767	I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
1768	To prove him false that says I love thee not.
1769	
1770	DEMETRIUS	I say I love thee more than he can do.
1771	
1772	LYSANDER	If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.
1773	
1774	DEMETRIUS	Quick, come!
1775	
1776	HERMIA	Lysander, whereto tends all this?
1777	
1778	LYSANDER	Away, you Ethiope!
1779	
1780	DEMETRIUS	                  No, no; he'll [        ]
1781	Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
1782	But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
1783	
1784	LYSANDER	Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,
1785	Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
1786	
1787	HERMIA	Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?
1788	Sweet love,--
1789	
1790	LYSANDER	Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!
1791	Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
1792	
1793	HERMIA	Do you not jest?
1794	
1795	HELENA	Yes, sooth; and so do you.
1796	
1797	LYSANDER	Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.
1798	
1799	DEMETRIUS	I would I had your bond, for I perceive
1800	A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
1801	
1802	LYSANDER	What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?
1803	Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
1804	
1805	HERMIA	What, can you do me greater harm than hate?
1806	Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
1807	Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
1808	I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
1809	Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
1810	me:
1811	Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
1812	In earnest, shall I say?
1813	
1814	LYSANDER	Ay, by my life;
1815	And never did desire to see thee more.
1816	Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
1817	Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
1818	That I do hate thee and love Helena.
1819	
1820	HERMIA	O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!
1821	You thief of love! what, have you come by night
1822	And stolen my love's heart from him?
1823	
1824	HELENA	Fine, i'faith!
1825	Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
1826	No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
1827	Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
1828	Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
1829	
1830	HERMIA	Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.
1831	Now I perceive that she hath made compare
1832	Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
1833	And with her personage, her tall personage,
1834	Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
1835	And are you grown so high in his esteem;
1836	Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
1837	How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
1838	How low am I? I am not yet so low
1839	But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
1840	
1841	HELENA	I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,
1842	Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
1843	I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
1844	I am a right maid for my cowardice:
1845	Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
1846	Because she is something lower than myself,
1847	That I can match her.
1848	
1849	HERMIA	Lower! hark, again.
1850	
1851	HELENA	Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.
1852	I evermore did love you, Hermia,
1853	Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
1854	Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
1855	I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
1856	He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
1857	But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
1858	To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
1859	And now, so you will let me quiet go,
1860	To Athens will I bear my folly back
1861	And follow you no further: let me go:
1862	You see how simple and how fond I am.
1863	
1864	HERMIA	Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?
1865	
1866	HELENA	A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.
1867	
1868	HERMIA	What, with Lysander?
1869	
1870	HELENA	With Demetrius.
1871	
1872	LYSANDER	Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.
1873	
1874	DEMETRIUS	No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.
1875	
1876	HELENA	O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!
1877	She was a vixen when she went to school;
1878	And though she be but little, she is fierce.
1879	
1880	HERMIA	'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!
1881	Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
1882	Let me come to her.
1883	
1884	LYSANDER	Get you gone, you dwarf;
1885	You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
1886	You bead, you acorn.
1887	
1888	DEMETRIUS	You are too officious
1889	In her behalf that scorns your services.
1890	Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
1891	Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
1892	Never so little show of love to her,
1893	Thou shalt aby it.
1894	
1895	LYSANDER	                  Now she holds me not;
1896	Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
1897	Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
1898	
1899	DEMETRIUS	Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.
1900	
1901	[Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS]
1902	
1903	HERMIA	You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:
1904	Nay, go not back.
1905	
1906	HELENA	                  I will not trust you, I,
1907	Nor longer stay in your curst company.
1908	Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
1909	My legs are longer though, to run away.
1910	
1911	[Exit]
1912	
1913	HERMIA	I am amazed, and know not what to say.
1914	
1915	[Exit]
1916	
1917	OBERON	This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,
1918	Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
1919	
1920	PUCK	Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.
1921	Did not you tell me I should know the man
1922	By the Athenian garment be had on?
1923	And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
1924	That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
1925	And so far am I glad it so did sort
1926	As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
1927	
1928	OBERON	Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:
1929	Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
1930	The starry welkin cover thou anon
1931	With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
1932	And lead these testy rivals so astray
1933	As one come not within another's way.
1934	Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
1935	Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
1936	And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
1937	And from each other look thou lead them thus,
1938	Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
1939	With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
1940	Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
1941	Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
1942	To take from thence all error with his might,
1943	And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
1944	When they next wake, all this derision
1945	Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
1946	And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
1947	With league whose date till death shall never end.
1948	Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
1949	I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
1950	And then I will her charmed eye release
1951	From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
1952	
1953	PUCK	My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,
1954	For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
1955	And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
1956	At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
1957	Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
1958	That in crossways and floods have burial,
1959	Already to their wormy beds are gone;
1960	For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
1961	They willfully themselves exile from light
1962	And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
1963	
1964	OBERON	But we are spirits of another sort:
1965	I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
1966	And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
1967	Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
1968	Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
1969	Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
1970	But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
1971	We may effect this business yet ere day.
1972	
1973	[Exit]
1974	
1975	PUCK	   Up and down, up and down,
1976	I will lead them up and down:
1977	I am fear'd in field and town:
1978	Goblin, lead them up and down.
1979	Here comes one.
1980	
1981	[Re-enter LYSANDER]
1982	
1983	LYSANDER	Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.
1984	
1985	PUCK	Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?
1986	
1987	LYSANDER	I will be with thee straight.
1988	
1989	PUCK	Follow me, then,
1990	To plainer ground.
1991	
1992	[Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice]
1993	
1994	[Re-enter DEMETRIUS]
1995	
1996	DEMETRIUS	                  Lysander! speak again:
1997	Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
1998	Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
1999	
2000	PUCK	Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,
2001	Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
2002	And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
2003	I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
2004	That draws a sword on thee.
2005	
2006	DEMETRIUS	Yea, art thou there?
2007	
2008	PUCK	Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.
2009	
2010	[Exeunt]
2011	
2012	[Re-enter LYSANDER]
2013	
2014	LYSANDER	He goes before me and still dares me on:
2015	When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
2016	The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
2017	I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
2018	That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
2019	And here will rest me.
2020	
2021	[Lies down]
2022	
2023	Come, thou gentle day!
2024	For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
2025	I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
2026	
2027	[Sleeps]
2028	
2029	[Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS]
2030	
2031	PUCK	Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?
2032	
2033	DEMETRIUS	Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot
2034	Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
2035	And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
2036	Where art thou now?
2037	
2038	PUCK	Come hither: I am here.
2039	
2040	DEMETRIUS	Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,
2041	If ever I thy face by daylight see:
2042	Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
2043	To measure out my length on this cold bed.
2044	By day's approach look to be visited.
2045	
2046	[Lies down and sleeps]
2047	
2048	[Re-enter HELENA]
2049	
2050	HELENA	O weary night, O long and tedious night,
2051	Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
2052	That I may back to Athens by daylight,
2053	From these that my poor company detest:
2054	And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
2055	Steal me awhile from mine own company.
2056	
2057	[Lies down and sleeps]
2058	
2059	PUCK	Yet but three? Come one more;
2060	Two of both kinds make up four.
2061	Here she comes, curst and sad:
2062	Cupid is a knavish lad,
2063	Thus to make poor females mad.
2064	
2065	[Re-enter HERMIA]
2066	
2067	HERMIA	Never so weary, never so in woe,
2068	Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
2069	I can no further crawl, no further go;
2070	My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
2071	Here will I rest me till the break of day.
2072	Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
2073	
2074	[Lies down and sleeps]
2075	
2076	PUCK	                  On the ground
2077	Sleep sound:
2078	I'll apply
2079	To your eye,
2080	Gentle lover, remedy.
2081	
2082	[Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes]
2083	
2084	When thou wakest,
2085	Thou takest
2086	True delight
2087	In the sight
2088	Of thy former lady's eye:
2089	And the country proverb known,
2090	That every man should take his own,
2091	In your waking shall be shown:
2092	Jack shall have Jill;
2093	Nought shall go ill;
2094	The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.

2101	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
2102	
2103	
2104	ACT IV
2105	
2106	
2107	
2108	SCENE I	The same. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA
2109	lying asleep.
2110	
2111	
2112	[Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH,
2113	MUSTARDSEED, and other Fairies attending; OBERON
2114	behind unseen]
2115	
2116	TITANIA	Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,
2117	While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
2118	And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
2119	And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
2120	
2121	BOTTOM	Where's Peaseblossom?
2122	
2123	PEASEBLOSSOM	Ready.
2124	
2125	BOTTOM	Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?
2126	
2127	COBWEB	Ready.
2128	
2129	BOTTOM	Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your
2130	weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
2131	humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
2132	mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
2133	yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
2134	good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
2135	I would be loath to have you overflown with a
2136	honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
2137	
2138	MUSTARDSEED	Ready.
2139	
2140	BOTTOM	Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,
2141	leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
2142	
2143	MUSTARDSEED	What's your Will?
2144	
2145	BOTTOM	Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb
2146	to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
2147	methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
2148	am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
2149	I must scratch.
2150	
2151	TITANIA	What, wilt thou hear some music,
2152	my sweet love?
2153	
2154	BOTTOM	I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have
2155	the tongs and the bones.
2156	
2157	TITANIA	Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.
2158	
2159	BOTTOM	Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good
2160	dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
2161	of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
2162	
2163	TITANIA	I have a venturous fairy that shall seek
2164	The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
2165	
2166	BOTTOM	I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.
2167	But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
2168	have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
2169	
2170	TITANIA	Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.
2171	Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
2172	
2173	[Exeunt fairies]
2174	
2175	So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
2176	Gently entwist; the female ivy so
2177	Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
2178	O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
2179	
2180	[They sleep]
2181	
2182	[Enter PUCK]
2183	
2184	OBERON	[Advancing]  Welcome, good Robin.
2185	See'st thou this sweet sight?
2186	Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
2187	For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
2188	Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
2189	I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
2190	For she his hairy temples then had rounded
2191	With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
2192	And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
2193	Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
2194	Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
2195	Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
2196	When I had at my pleasure taunted her
2197	And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
2198	I then did ask of her her changeling child;
2199	Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
2200	To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
2201	And now I have the boy, I will undo
2202	This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
2203	And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
2204	From off the head of this Athenian swain;
2205	That, he awaking when the other do,
2206	May all to Athens back again repair
2207	And think no more of this night's accidents
2208	But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
2209	But first I will release the fairy queen.
2210	Be as thou wast wont to be;
2211	See as thou wast wont to see:
2212	Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
2213	Hath such force and blessed power.
2214	Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
2215	
2216	TITANIA	My Oberon! what visions have I seen!
2217	Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
2218	
2219	OBERON	There lies your love.
2220	
2221	TITANIA	How came these things to pass?
2222	O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
2223	
2224	OBERON	Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.
2225	Titania, music call; and strike more dead
2226	Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
2227	
2228	TITANIA	Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!
2229	
2230	[Music, still]
2231	
2232	PUCK	Now, when thou wakest, with thine
2233	own fool's eyes peep.
2234	
2235	OBERON	Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,
2236	And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
2237	Now thou and I are new in amity,
2238	And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
2239	Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
2240	And bless it to all fair prosperity:
2241	There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
2242	Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
2243	
2244	PUCK	Fairy king, attend, and mark:
2245	I do hear the morning lark.
2246	
2247	OBERON	Then, my queen, in silence sad,
2248	Trip we after the night's shade:
2249	We the globe can compass soon,
2250	Swifter than the wandering moon.
2251	
2252	TITANIA	Come, my lord, and in our flight
2253	Tell me how it came this night
2254	That I sleeping here was found
2255	With these mortals on the ground.
2256	
2257	[Exeunt]
2258	
2259	[Horns winded within]
2260	
2261	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train]
2262	
2263	THESEUS	Go, one of you, find out the forester;
2264	For now our observation is perform'd;
2265	And since we have the vaward of the day,
2266	My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
2267	Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
2268	Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
2269	
2270	[Exit an Attendant]
2271	
2272	We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
2273	And mark the musical confusion
2274	Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
2275	
2276	HIPPOLYTA	I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,
2277	When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
2278	With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
2279	Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
2280	The skies, the fountains, every region near
2281	Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
2282	So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
2283	
2284	THESEUS	My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,
2285	So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
2286	With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
2287	Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
2288	Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
2289	Each under each. A cry more tuneable
2290	Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
2291	In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
2292	Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
2293	
2294	EGEUS	My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;
2295	And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
2296	This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
2297	I wonder of their being here together.
2298	
2299	THESEUS	No doubt they rose up early to observe
2300	The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
2301	Came here in grace our solemnity.
2302	But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
2303	That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
2304	
2305	EGEUS	It is, my lord.
2306	
2307	THESEUS	Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.
2308	
2309	[Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS,
2310	HELENA, and HERMIA wake and start up]
2311	
2312	Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
2313	Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
2314	
2315	LYSANDER	Pardon, my lord.
2316	
2317	THESEUS	                  I pray you all, stand up.
2318	I know you two are rival enemies:
2319	How comes this gentle concord in the world,
2320	That hatred is so far from jealousy,
2321	To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
2322	
2323	LYSANDER	My lord, I shall reply amazedly,
2324	Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
2325	I cannot truly say how I came here;
2326	But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
2327	And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
2328	I came with Hermia hither: our intent
2329	Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
2330	Without the peril of the Athenian law.
2331	
2332	EGEUS	Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:
2333	I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
2334	They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
2335	Thereby to have defeated you and me,
2336	You of your wife and me of my consent,
2337	Of my consent that she should be your wife.
2338	
2339	DEMETRIUS	My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,
2340	Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
2341	And I in fury hither follow'd them,
2342	Fair Helena in fancy following me.
2343	But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
2344	But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
2345	Melted as the snow, seems to me now
2346	As the remembrance of an idle gaud
2347	Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
2348	And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
2349	The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
2350	Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
2351	Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
2352	But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
2353	But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
2354	Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
2355	And will for evermore be true to it.
2356	
2357	THESEUS	Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:
2358	Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
2359	Egeus, I will overbear your will;
2360	For in the temple by and by with us
2361	These couples shall eternally be knit:
2362	And, for the morning now is something worn,
2363	Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
2364	Away with us to Athens; three and three,
2365	We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
2366	Come, Hippolyta.
2367	
2368	[Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train]
2369	
2370	DEMETRIUS	These things seem small and undistinguishable,
2371	HERMIA	Methinks I see these things with parted eye,
2372	When every thing seems double.
2373	
2374	HELENA	So methinks:
2375	And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
2376	Mine own, and not mine own.
2377	
2378	DEMETRIUS	Are you sure
2379	That we are awake? It seems to me
2380	That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
2381	The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
2382	
2383	HERMIA	Yea; and my father.
2384	
2385	HELENA	And Hippolyta.
2386	
2387	LYSANDER	And he did bid us follow to the temple.
2388	
2389	DEMETRIUS	Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him
2390	And by the way let us recount our dreams.
2391	
2392	[Exeunt]
2393	
2394	BOTTOM	[Awaking]  When my cue comes, call me, and I will
2395	answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
2396	Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
2397	the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
2398	hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
2399	vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
2400	say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
2401	about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
2402	is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
2403	methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
2404	he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
2405	of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
2406	seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
2407	to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
2408	was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
2409	this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
2410	because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
2411	latter end of a play, before the duke:
2412	peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
2413	sing it at her death.
2414

2421	
2422	
2423	ACT IV
2424	
2425	
2426	
2427	SCENE II	Athens. QUINCE'S house.
2428	
2429	
2430	[Enter QUINCE, FLUTE, SNOUT, and STARVELING]
2431	
2432	QUINCE	Have you sent to Bottom's house? is he come home yet?
2433	
2434	STARVELING	He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is
2435	transported.
2436	
2437	FLUTE	If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes
2438	not forward, doth it?
2439	
2440	QUINCE	It is not possible: you have not a man in all
2441	Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
2442	
2443	FLUTE	No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft
2444	man in Athens.
2445	
2446	QUINCE	Yea and the best person too; and he is a very
2447	paramour for a sweet voice.
2448	
2449	FLUTE	You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,
2450	a thing of naught.
2451	
2452	[Enter SNUG]
2453	
2454	SNUG	Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and
2455	there is two or three lords and ladies more married:
2456	if our sport had gone forward, we had all been made
2457	men.
2458	
2459	FLUTE	O sweet bully Bottom! Thus hath he lost sixpence a
2460	day during his life; he could not have 'scaped
2461	sixpence a day: an the duke had not given him
2462	sixpence a day for playing Pyramus, I'll be hanged;
2463	he would have deserved it: sixpence a day in
2464	Pyramus, or nothing.
2465	
2466	[Enter BOTTOM]
2467	
2468	BOTTOM	Where are these lads? where are these hearts?
2469	
2470	QUINCE	Bottom! O most courageous day! O most happy hour!
2471	
2472	BOTTOM	Masters, I am to discourse wonders: but ask me not
2473	what; for if I tell you, I am no true Athenian. I
2474	will tell you every thing, right as it fell out.
2475	
2476	QUINCE	Let us hear, sweet Bottom.
2477	
2478	BOTTOM	Not a word of me. All that I will tell you is, that
2479	the duke hath dined. Get your apparel together,
2480	good strings to your beards, new ribbons to your
2481	pumps; meet presently at the palace; every man look
2482	o'er his part; for the short and the long is, our
2483	play is preferred. In any case, let Thisby have
2484	clean linen; and let not him that plays the lion
2485	pair his nails, for they shall hang out for the
2486	lion's claws. And, most dear actors, eat no onions
2487	nor garlic, for we are to utter sweet breath; and I
2488	do not doubt but to hear them say, it is a sweet
2489	comedy. No more words: away! go, away!

2496	A MIDSUMMER NIGHT'S DREAM
2497	
2498	
2499	ACT V
2500	
2501	
2502	
2503	SCENE I	Athens. The palace of THESEUS.
2504	
2505	
2506	[Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, PHILOSTRATE, Lords and
2507	Attendants]
2508	
2509	HIPPOLYTA	'Tis strange my Theseus, that these
2510	lovers speak of.
2511	
2512	THESEUS	More strange than true: I never may believe
2513	These antique fables, nor these fairy toys.
2514	Lovers and madmen have such seething brains,
2515	Such shaping fantasies, that apprehend
2516	More than cool reason ever comprehends.
2517	The lunatic, the lover and the poet
2518	Are of imagination all compact:
2519	One sees more devils than vast hell can hold,
2520	That is, the madman: the lover, all as frantic,
2521	Sees Helen's beauty in a brow of Egypt:
2522	The poet's eye, in fine frenzy rolling,
2523	Doth glance from heaven to earth, from earth to heaven;
2524	And as imagination bodies forth
2525	The forms of things unknown, the poet's pen
2526	Turns them to shapes and gives to airy nothing
2527	A local habitation and a name.
2528	Such tricks hath strong imagination,
2529	That if it would but apprehend some joy,
2530	It comprehends some bringer of that joy;
2531	Or in the night, imagining some fear,
2532	How easy is a bush supposed a bear!
2533	
2534	HIPPOLYTA	But all the story of the night told over,
2535	And all their minds transfigured so together,
2536	More witnesseth than fancy's images
2537	And grows to something of great constancy;
2538	But, howsoever, strange and admirable.
2539	
2540	THESEUS	Here come the lovers, full of joy and mirth.
2541	
2542	[Enter LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HERMIA, and HELENA]
2543	
2544	Joy, gentle friends! joy and fresh days of love
2545	Accompany your hearts!
2546	
2547	LYSANDER	More than to us
2548	Wait in your royal walks, your board, your bed!
2549	
2550	THESEUS	Come now; what masques, what dances shall we have,
2551	To wear away this long age of three hours
2552	Between our after-supper and bed-time?
2553	Where is our usual manager of mirth?
2554	What revels are in hand? Is there no play,
2555	To ease the anguish of a torturing hour?
2556	Call Philostrate.
2557	
2558	PHILOSTRATE	                  Here, mighty Theseus.
2559	
2560	THESEUS	Say, what abridgement have you for this evening?
2561	What masque? what music? How shall we beguile
2562	The lazy time, if not with some delight?
2563	
2564	PHILOSTRATE	There is a brief how many sports are ripe:
2565	Make choice of which your highness will see first.
2566	
2567	[Giving a paper]
2568	
2569	THESEUS	[Reads]  'The battle with the Centaurs, to be sung
2570	By an Athenian eunuch to the harp.'
2571	We'll none of that: that have I told my love,
2572	In glory of my kinsman Hercules.
2573	
2574	[Reads]
2575	
2576	'The riot of the tipsy Bacchanals,
2577	Tearing the Thracian singer in their rage.'
2578	That is an old device; and it was play'd
2579	When I from Thebes came last a conqueror.
2580	
2581	[Reads]
2582	
2583	'The thrice three Muses mourning for the death
2584	Of Learning, late deceased in beggary.'
2585	That is some satire, keen and critical,
2586	Not sorting with a nuptial ceremony.
2587	
2588	[Reads]
2589	
2590	'A tedious brief scene of young Pyramus
2591	And his love Thisbe; very tragical mirth.'
2592	Merry and tragical! tedious and brief!
2593	That is, hot ice and wondrous strange snow.
2594	How shall we find the concord of this discord?
2595	
2596	PHILOSTRATE	A play there is, my lord, some ten words long,
2597	Which is as brief as I have known a play;
2598	But by ten words, my lord, it is too long,
2599	Which makes it tedious; for in all the play
2600	There is not one word apt, one player fitted:
2601	And tragical, my noble lord, it is;
2602	For Pyramus therein doth kill himself.
2603	Which, when I saw rehearsed, I must confess,
2604	Made mine eyes water; but more merry tears
2605	The passion of loud laughter never shed.
2606	
2607	THESEUS	What are they that do play it?
2608	
2609	PHILOSTRATE	Hard-handed men that work in Athens here,
2610	Which never labour'd in their minds till now,
2611	And now have toil'd their unbreathed memories
2612	With this same play, against your nuptial.
2613	
2614	THESEUS	And we will hear it.
2615	
2616	PHILOSTRATE	No, my noble lord;
2617	It is not for you: I have heard it over,
2618	And it is nothing, nothing in the world;
2619	Unless you can find sport in their intents,
2620	Extremely stretch'd and conn'd with cruel pain,
2621	To do you service.
2622	
2623	THESEUS	                  I will hear that play;
2624	For never anything can be amiss,
2625	When simpleness and duty tender it.
2626	Go, bring them in: and take your places, ladies.
2627	
2628	[Exit PHILOSTRATE]
2629	
2630	HIPPOLYTA	I love not to see wretchedness o'er charged
2631	And duty in his service perishing.
2632	
2633	THESEUS	Why, gentle sweet, you shall see no such thing.
2634	
2635	HIPPOLYTA	He says they can do nothing in this kind.
2636	
2637	THESEUS	The kinder we, to give them thanks for nothing.
2638	Our sport shall be to take what they mistake:
2639	And what poor duty cannot do, noble respect
2640	Takes it in might, not merit.
2641	Where I have come, great clerks have purposed
2642	To greet me with premeditated welcomes;
2643	Where I have seen them shiver and look pale,
2644	Make periods in the midst of sentences,
2645	Throttle their practised accent in their fears
2646	And in conclusion dumbly have broke off,
2647	Not paying me a welcome. Trust me, sweet,
2648	Out of this silence yet I pick'd a welcome;
2649	And in the modesty of fearful duty
2650	I read as much as from the rattling tongue
2651	Of saucy and audacious eloquence.
2652	Love, therefore, and tongue-tied simplicity
2653	In least speak most, to my capacity.
2654	
2655	[Re-enter PHILOSTRATE]
2656	
2657	PHILOSTRATE	So please your grace, the Prologue is address'd.
2658	
2659	THESEUS	Let him approach.
2660	
2661	[Flourish of trumpets]
2662	
2663	[Enter QUINCE for the Prologue]
2664	
2665	Prologue	If we offend, it is with our good will.
2666	That you should think, we come not to offend,
2667	But with good will. To show our simple skill,
2668	That is the true beginning of our end.
2669	Consider then we come but in despite.
2670	We do not come as minding to contest you,
2671	Our true intent is. All for your delight
2672	We are not here. That you should here repent you,
2673	The actors are at hand and by their show
2674	You shall know all that you are like to know.
2675	
2676	THESEUS	This fellow doth not stand upon points.
2677	
2678	LYSANDER	He hath rid his prologue like a rough colt; he knows
2679	not the stop. A good moral, my lord: it is not
2680	enough to speak, but to speak true.
2681	
2682	HIPPOLYTA	Indeed he hath played on his prologue like a child
2683	on a recorder; a sound, but not in government.
2684	
2685	THESEUS	His speech, was like a tangled chain; nothing
2686	impaired, but all disordered. Who is next?
2687	
2688	[Enter Pyramus and Thisbe, Wall, Moonshine, and Lion]
2689	
2690	Prologue	Gentles, perchance you wonder at this show;
2691	But wonder on, till truth make all things plain.
2692	This man is Pyramus, if you would know;
2693	This beauteous lady Thisby is certain.
2694	This man, with lime and rough-cast, doth present
2695	Wall, that vile Wall which did these lovers sunder;
2696	And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content
2697	To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
2698	This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
2699	Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
2700	By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
2701	To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
2702	This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
2703	The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
2704	Did scare away, or rather did affright;
2705	And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
2706	Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
2707	Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
2708	And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
2709	Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
2710	He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
2711	And Thisby, tarrying in mulberry shade,
2712	His dagger drew, and died. For all the rest,
2713	Let Lion, Moonshine, Wall, and lovers twain
2714	At large discourse, while here they do remain.
2715	
2716	[Exeunt Prologue, Thisbe, Lion, and Moonshine]
2717	
2718	THESEUS	I wonder if the lion be to speak.
2719	
2720	DEMETRIUS	No wonder, my lord: one lion may, when many asses do.
2721	
2722	Wall	In this same interlude it doth befall
2723	That I, one Snout by name, present a wall;
2724	And such a wall, as I would have you think,
2725	That had in it a crannied hole or chink,
2726	Through which the lovers, Pyramus and Thisby,
2727	Did whisper often very secretly.
2728	This loam, this rough-cast and this stone doth show
2729	That I am that same wall; the truth is so:
2730	And this the cranny is, right and sinister,
2731	Through which the fearful lovers are to whisper.
2732	
2733	THESEUS	Would you desire lime and hair to speak better?
2734	
2735	DEMETRIUS	It is the wittiest partition that ever I heard
2736	discourse, my lord.
2737	
2738	[Enter Pyramus]
2739	
2740	THESEUS	Pyramus draws near the wall: silence!
2741	
2742	Pyramus	O grim-look'd night! O night with hue so black!
2743	O night, which ever art when day is not!
2744	O night, O night! alack, alack, alack,
2745	I fear my Thisby's promise is forgot!
2746	And thou, O wall, O sweet, O lovely wall,
2747	That stand'st between her father's ground and mine!
2748	Thou wall, O wall, O sweet and lovely wall,
2749	Show me thy chink, to blink through with mine eyne!
2750	
2751	[Wall holds up his fingers]
2752	
2753	Thanks, courteous wall: Jove shield thee well for this!
2754	But what see I? No Thisby do I see.
2755	O wicked wall, through whom I see no bliss!
2756	Cursed be thy stones for thus deceiving me!
2757	
2758	THESEUS	The wall, methinks, being sensible, should curse again.
2759	
2760	Pyramus	No, in truth, sir, he should not. 'Deceiving me'
2761	is Thisby's cue: she is to enter now, and I am to
2762	spy her through the wall. You shall see, it will
2763	fall pat as I told you. Yonder she comes.
2764	
2765	[Enter Thisbe]
2766	
2767	Thisbe	O wall, full often hast thou heard my moans,
2768	For parting my fair Pyramus and me!
2769	My cherry lips have often kiss'd thy stones,
2770	Thy stones with lime and hair knit up in thee.
2771	
2772	Pyramus	I see a voice: now will I to the chink,
2773	To spy an I can hear my Thisby's face. Thisby!
2774	
2775	Thisbe	My love thou art, my love I think.
2776	
2777	Pyramus	Think what thou wilt, I am thy lover's grace;
2778	And, like Limander, am I trusty still.
2779	
2780	Thisbe	And I like Helen, till the Fates me kill.
2781	
2782	Pyramus	Not Shafalus to Procrus was so true.
2783	
2784	Thisbe	As Shafalus to Procrus, I to you.
2785	
2786	Pyramus	O kiss me through the hole of this vile wall!
2787	
2788	Thisbe	I kiss the wall's hole, not your lips at all.
2789	
2790	Pyramus	Wilt thou at Ninny's tomb meet me straightway?
2791	
2792	Thisbe	'Tide life, 'tide death, I come without delay.
2793	
2794	[Exeunt Pyramus and Thisbe]
2795	
2796	Wall	Thus have I, Wall, my part discharged so;
2797	And, being done, thus Wall away doth go.
2798	
2799	[Exit]
2800	
2801	THESEUS	Now is the mural down between the two neighbours.
2802	
2803	DEMETRIUS	No remedy, my lord, when walls are so wilful to hear
2804	without warning.
2805	
2806	HIPPOLYTA	This is the silliest stuff that ever I heard.
2807	
2808	THESEUS	The best in this kind are but shadows; and the worst
2809	are no worse, if imagination amend them.
2810	
2811	HIPPOLYTA	It must be your imagination then, and not theirs.
2812	
2813	THESEUS	If we imagine no worse of them than they of
2814	themselves, they may pass for excellent men. Here
2815	come two noble beasts in, a man and a lion.
2816	
2817	[Enter Lion and Moonshine]
2818	
2819	Lion	You, ladies, you, whose gentle hearts do fear
2820	The smallest monstrous mouse that creeps on floor,
2821	May now perchance both quake and tremble here,
2822	When lion rough in wildest rage doth roar.
2823	Then know that I, one Snug the joiner, am
2824	A lion-fell, nor else no lion's dam;
2825	For, if I should as lion come in strife
2826	Into this place, 'twere pity on my life.
2827	
2828	THESEUS	A very gentle beast, of a good conscience.
2829	
2830	DEMETRIUS	The very best at a beast, my lord, that e'er I saw.
2831	
2832	LYSANDER	This lion is a very fox for his valour.
2833	
2834	THESEUS	True; and a goose for his discretion.
2835	
2836	DEMETRIUS	Not so, my lord; for his valour cannot carry his
2837	discretion; and the fox carries the goose.
2838	
2839	THESEUS	His discretion, I am sure, cannot carry his valour;
2840	for the goose carries not the fox. It is well:
2841	leave it to his discretion, and let us listen to the moon.
2842	
2843	Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;--
2844	
2845	DEMETRIUS	He should have worn the horns on his head.
2846	
2847	THESEUS	He is no crescent, and his horns are
2848	invisible within the circumference.
2849	
2850	Moonshine	This lanthorn doth the horned moon present;
2851	Myself the man i' the moon do seem to be.
2852	
2853	THESEUS	This is the greatest error of all the rest: the man
2854	should be put into the lanthorn. How is it else the
2855	man i' the moon?
2856	
2857	DEMETRIUS	He dares not come there for the candle; for, you
2858	see, it is already in snuff.
2859	
2860	HIPPOLYTA	I am aweary of this moon: would he would change!
2861	
2862	THESEUS	It appears, by his small light of discretion, that
2863	he is in the wane; but yet, in courtesy, in all
2864	reason, we must stay the time.
2865	
2866	LYSANDER	Proceed, Moon.
2867	
2868	Moonshine	All that I have to say, is, to tell you that the
2869	lanthorn is the moon; I, the man in the moon; this
2870	thorn-bush, my thorn-bush; and this dog, my dog.
2871	
2872	DEMETRIUS	Why, all these should be in the lanthorn; for all
2873	these are in the moon. But, silence! here comes Thisbe.
2874	
2875	[Enter Thisbe]
2876	
2877	Thisbe	This is old Ninny's tomb. Where is my love?
2878	
2879	Lion	[Roaring]  Oh--
2880	
2881	[Thisbe runs off]
2882	
2883	DEMETRIUS	Well roared, Lion.
2884	
2885	THESEUS	Well run, Thisbe.
2886	
2887	HIPPOLYTA	Well shone, Moon. Truly, the moon shines with a
2888	good grace.
2889	
2890	[The Lion shakes Thisbe's mantle, and exit]
2891	
2892	THESEUS	Well moused, Lion.
2893	
2894	LYSANDER	And so the lion vanished.
2895	
2896	DEMETRIUS	And then came Pyramus.
2897	
2898	[Enter Pyramus]
2899	
2900	Pyramus	Sweet Moon, I thank thee for thy sunny beams;
2901	I thank thee, Moon, for shining now so bright;
2902	For, by thy gracious, golden, glittering gleams,
2903	I trust to take of truest Thisby sight.
2904	But stay, O spite!
2905	But mark, poor knight,
2906	What dreadful dole is here!
2907	Eyes, do you see?
2908	How can it be?
2909	O dainty duck! O dear!
2910	Thy mantle good,
2911	What, stain'd with blood!
2912	Approach, ye Furies fell!
2913	O Fates, come, come,
2914	Cut thread and thrum;
2915	Quail, crush, conclude, and quell!
2916	
2917	THESEUS	This passion, and the death of a dear friend, would
2918	go near to make a man look sad.
2919	
2920	HIPPOLYTA	Beshrew my heart, but I pity the man.
2921	
2922	Pyramus	O wherefore, Nature, didst thou lions frame?
2923	Since lion vile hath here deflower'd my dear:
2924	Which is--no, no--which was the fairest dame
2925	That lived, that loved, that liked, that look'd
2926	with cheer.
2927	Come, tears, confound;
2928	Out, sword, and wound
2929	The pap of Pyramus;
2930	Ay, that left pap,
2931	Where heart doth hop:
2932	
2933	[Stabs himself]
2934	
2935	Thus die I, thus, thus, thus.
2936	Now am I dead,
2937	Now am I fled;
2938	My soul is in the sky:
2939	Tongue, lose thy light;
2940	Moon take thy flight:
2941	
2942	[Exit Moonshine]
2943	
2944	Now die, die, die, die, die.
2945	
2946	[Dies]
2947	
2948	DEMETRIUS	No die, but an ace, for him; for he is but one.
2949	
2950	LYSANDER	Less than an ace, man; for he is dead; he is nothing.
2951	
2952	THESEUS	With the help of a surgeon he might yet recover, and
2953	prove an ass.
2954	
2955	HIPPOLYTA	How chance Moonshine is gone before Thisbe comes
2956	back and finds her lover?
2957	
2958	THESEUS	She will find him by starlight. Here she comes; and
2959	her passion ends the play.
2960	
2961	[Re-enter Thisbe]
2962	
2963	HIPPOLYTA	Methinks she should not use a long one for such a
2964	Pyramus: I hope she will be brief.
2965	
2966	DEMETRIUS	A mote will turn the balance, which Pyramus, which
2967	Thisbe, is the better; he for a man, God warrant us;
2968	she for a woman, God bless us.
2969	
2970	LYSANDER	She hath spied him already with those sweet eyes.
2971	
2972	DEMETRIUS	And thus she means, videlicet:--
2973	
2974	Thisbe	          Asleep, my love?
2975	What, dead, my dove?
2976	O Pyramus, arise!
2977	Speak, speak. Quite dumb?
2978	Dead, dead? A tomb
2979	Must cover thy sweet eyes.
2980	These My lips,
2981	This cherry nose,
2982	These yellow cowslip cheeks,
2983	Are gone, are gone:
2984	Lovers, make moan:
2985	His eyes were green as leeks.
2986	O Sisters Three,
2987	Come, come to me,
2988	With hands as pale as milk;
2989	Lay them in gore,
2990	Since you have shore
2991	With shears his thread of silk.
2992	Tongue, not a word:
2993	Come, trusty sword;
2994	Come, blade, my breast imbrue:
2995	
2996	[Stabs herself]
2997	
2998	And, farewell, friends;
2999	Thus Thisby ends:
3000	Adieu, adieu, adieu.
3001	
3002	[Dies]
3003	
3004	THESEUS	Moonshine and Lion are left to bury the dead.
3005	
3006	DEMETRIUS	Ay, and Wall too.
3007	
3008	BOTTOM	[Starting up]  No assure you; the wall is down that
3009	parted their fathers. Will it please you to see the
3010	epilogue, or to hear a Bergomask dance between two
3011	of our company?
3012	
3013	THESEUS	No epilogue, I pray you; for your play needs no
3014	excuse. Never excuse; for when the players are all
3015	dead, there needs none to be blamed. Marry, if he
3016	that writ it had played Pyramus and hanged himself
3017	in Thisbe's garter, it would have been a fine
3018	tragedy: and so it is, truly; and very notably
3019	discharged. But come, your Bergomask: let your
3020	epilogue alone.
3021	
3022	[A dance]
3023	
3024	The iron tongue of midnight hath told twelve:
3025	Lovers, to bed; 'tis almost fairy time.
3026	I fear we shall out-sleep the coming morn
3027	As much as we this night have overwatch'd.
3028	This palpable-gross play hath well beguiled
3029	The heavy gait of night. Sweet friends, to bed.
3030	A fortnight hold we this solemnity,
3031	In nightly revels and new jollity.
3032	
3033	[Exeunt]
3034	
3035	[Enter PUCK]
3036	
3037	PUCK	     Now the hungry lion roars,
3038	And the wolf behowls the moon;
3039	Whilst the heavy ploughman snores,
3040	All with weary task fordone.
3041	Now the wasted brands do glow,
3042	Whilst the screech-owl, screeching loud,
3043	Puts the wretch that lies in woe
3044	In remembrance of a shroud.
3045	Now it is the time of night
3046	That the graves all gaping wide,
3047	Every one lets forth his sprite,
3048	In the church-way paths to glide:
3049	And we fairies, that do run
3050	By the triple Hecate's team,
3051	From the presence of the sun,
3052	Following darkness like a dream,
3053	Now are frolic: not a mouse
3054	Shall disturb this hallow'd house:
3055	I am sent with broom before,
3056	To sweep the dust behind the door.
3057	
3058	[Enter OBERON and TITANIA with their train]
3059	
3060	OBERON	     Through the house give gathering light,
3061	By the dead and drowsy fire:
3062	Every elf and fairy sprite
3063	Hop as light as bird from brier;
3064	And this ditty, after me,
3065	Sing, and dance it trippingly.
3066	
3067	TITANIA	First, rehearse your song by rote
3068	To each word a warbling note:
3069	Hand in hand, with fairy grace,
3070	Will we sing, and bless this place.
3071	
3072	[Song and dance]
3073	
3074	OBERON	Now, until the break of day,
3075	Through this house each fairy stray.
3076	To the best bride-bed will we,
3077	Which by us shall blessed be;
3078	And the issue there create
3079	Ever shall be fortunate.
3080	So shall all the couples three
3081	Ever true in loving be;
3082	And the blots of Nature's hand
3083	Shall not in their issue stand;
3084	Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,
3085	Nor mark prodigious, such as are
3086	Despised in nativity,
3087	Shall upon their children be.
3088	With this field-dew consecrate,
3089	Every fairy take his gait;
3090	And each several chamber bless,
3091	Through this palace, with sweet peace;
3092	And the owner of it blest
3093	Ever shall in safety rest.
3094	Trip away; make no stay;
3095	Meet me all by break of day.
3096	
3097	[Exeunt OBERON, TITANIA, and train]
3098	
3099	PUCK	If we shadows have offended,
3100	Think but this, and all is mended,
3101	That you have but slumber'd here
3102	While these visions did appear.
3103	And this weak and idle theme,
3104	No more yielding but a dream,
3105	Gentles, do not reprehend:
3106	if you pardon, we will mend:
3107	And, as I am an honest Puck,
3108	If we have unearned luck
3109	Now to 'scape the serpent's tongue,
3110	We will make amends ere long;
3111	Else the Puck a liar call;
3112	So, good night unto you all.
3113	Give me your hands, if we be friends,
3114	And Robin shall restore amends.

57	ACT I
58	
59	
60	
61	SCENE I	Venice. A street.
62	
63	
64	[Enter RODERIGO and IAGO]
65	
66	RODERIGO	Tush! never tell me; I take it much unkindly
67	That thou, Iago, who hast had my purse
68	As if the strings were thine, shouldst know of this.
69	
70	IAGO	'Sblood, but you will not hear me:
71	If ever I did dream of such a matter, Abhor me.
72	
73	RODERIGO	Thou told'st me thou didst hold him in thy hate.
74	
75	IAGO	Despise me, if I do not. Three great ones of the city,
76	In personal suit to make me his lieutenant,
77	Off-capp'd to him: and, by the faith of man,
78	I know my price, I am worth no worse a place:
79	But he; as loving his own pride and purposes,
80	Evades them, with a bombast circumstance
81	Horribly stuff'd with epithets of war;
82	And, in conclusion,
83	Nonsuits my mediators; for, 'Certes,' says he,
84	'I have already chose my officer.'
85	And what was he?
86	Forsooth, a great arithmetician,
87	One Michael Cassio, a Florentine,
88	A fellow almost damn'd in a fair wife;
89	That never set a squadron in the field,
90	Nor the division of a battle knows
91	More than a spinster; unless the bookish theoric,
92	Wherein the toged consuls can propose
93	As masterly as he: mere prattle, without practise,
94	Is all his soldiership. But he, sir, had the election:
95	And I, of whom his eyes had seen the proof
96	At Rhodes, at Cyprus and on other grounds
97	Christian and heathen, must be be-lee'd and calm'd
98	By debitor and creditor: this counter-caster,
99	He, in good time, must his lieutenant be,
100	And I--God bless the mark!--his Moorship's ancient.
101	
102	RODERIGO	By heaven, I rather would have been his hangman.
103	
104	IAGO	Why, there's no remedy; 'tis the curse of service,
105	Preferment goes by letter and affection,
106	And not by old gradation, where each second
107	Stood heir to the first. Now, sir, be judge yourself,
108	Whether I in any just term am affined
109	To love the Moor.
110	
111	RODERIGO	I would not follow him then.
112	
113	IAGO	O, sir, content you;
114	I follow him to serve my turn upon him:
115	We cannot all be masters, nor all masters
116	Cannot be truly follow'd. You shall mark
117	Many a duteous and knee-crooking knave,
118	That, doting on his own obsequious bondage,
119	Wears out his time, much like his master's ass,
120	For nought but provender, and when he's old, cashier'd:
121	Whip me such honest knaves. Others there are
122	Who, trimm'd in forms and visages of duty,
123	Keep yet their hearts attending on themselves,
124	And, throwing but shows of service on their lords,
125	Do well thrive by them and when they have lined
126	their coats
127	Do themselves homage: these fellows have some soul;
128	And such a one do I profess myself. For, sir,
129	It is as sure as you are Roderigo,
130	Were I the Moor, I would not be Iago:
131	In following him, I follow but myself;
132	Heaven is my judge, not I for love and duty,
133	But seeming so, for my peculiar end:
134	For when my outward action doth demonstrate
135	The native act and figure of my heart
136	In compliment extern, 'tis not long after
137	But I will wear my heart upon my sleeve
138	For daws to peck at: I am not what I am.
139	
140	RODERIGO	What a full fortune does the thicklips owe
141	If he can carry't thus!
142	
143	IAGO	Call up her father,
144	Rouse him: make after him, poison his delight,
145	Proclaim him in the streets; incense her kinsmen,
146	And, though he in a fertile climate dwell,
147	Plague him with flies: though that his joy be joy,
148	Yet throw such changes of vexation on't,
149	As it may lose some colour.
150	
151	RODERIGO	Here is her father's house; I'll call aloud.
152	
153	IAGO	Do, with like timorous accent and dire yell
154	As when, by night and negligence, the fire
155	Is spied in populous cities.
156	
157	RODERIGO	What, ho, Brabantio! Signior Brabantio, ho!
158	
159	IAGO	Awake! what, ho, Brabantio! thieves! thieves! thieves!
160	Look to your house, your daughter and your bags!
161	Thieves! thieves!
162	
163	[BRABANTIO appears above, at a window]
164	
165	BRABANTIO	What is the reason of this terrible summons?
166	What is the matter there?
167	
168	RODERIGO	Signior, is all your family within?
169	
170	IAGO	Are your doors lock'd?
171	
172	BRABANTIO	Why, wherefore ask you this?
173	
174	IAGO	'Zounds, sir, you're robb'd; for shame, put on
175	your gown;
176	Your heart is burst, you have lost half your soul;
177	Even now, now, very now, an old black ram
178	Is topping your white ewe. Arise, arise;
179	Awake the snorting citizens with the bell,
180	Or else the devil will make a grandsire of you:
181	Arise, I say.
182	
183	BRABANTIO	                  What, have you lost your wits?
184	
185	RODERIGO	Most reverend signior, do you know my voice?
186	
187	BRABANTIO	Not I	what are you?
188	
189	RODERIGO	My name is Roderigo.
190	
191	BRABANTIO	The worser welcome:
192	I have charged thee not to haunt about my doors:
193	In honest plainness thou hast heard me say
194	My daughter is not for thee; and now, in madness,
195	Being full of supper and distempering draughts,
196	Upon malicious bravery, dost thou come
197	To start my quiet.
198	
199	RODERIGO	Sir, sir, sir,--
200	
201	BRABANTIO	                  But thou must needs be sure
202	My spirit and my place have in them power
203	To make this bitter to thee.
204	
205	RODERIGO	Patience, good sir.
206	
207	BRABANTIO	What tell'st thou me of robbing? this is Venice;
208	My house is not a grange.
209	
210	RODERIGO	Most grave Brabantio,
211	In simple and pure soul I come to you.
212	
213	IAGO	'Zounds, sir, you are one of those that will not
214	serve God, if the devil bid you. Because we come to
215	do you service and you think we are ruffians, you'll
216	have your daughter covered with a Barbary horse;
217	you'll have your nephews neigh to you; you'll have
218	coursers for cousins and gennets for germans.
219	
220	BRABANTIO	What profane wretch art thou?
221	
222	IAGO	I am one, sir, that comes to tell you your daughter
223	and the Moor are now making the beast with two backs.
224	
225	BRABANTIO	Thou art a villain.
226	
227	IAGO	You are--a senator.
228	
229	BRABANTIO	This thou shalt answer; I know thee, Roderigo.
230	
231	RODERIGO	Sir, I will answer any thing. But, I beseech you,
232	If't be your pleasure and most wise consent,
233	As partly I find it is, that your fair daughter,
234	At this odd-even and dull watch o' the night,
235	Transported, with no worse nor better guard
236	But with a knave of common hire, a gondolier,
237	To the gross clasps of a lascivious Moor--
238	If this be known to you and your allowance,
239	We then have done you bold and saucy wrongs;
240	But if you know not this, my manners tell me
241	We have your wrong rebuke. Do not believe
242	That, from the sense of all civility,
243	I thus would play and trifle with your reverence:
244	Your daughter, if you have not given her leave,
245	I say again, hath made a gross revolt;
246	Tying her duty, beauty, wit and fortunes
247	In an extravagant and wheeling stranger
248	Of here and every where. Straight satisfy yourself:
249	If she be in her chamber or your house,
250	Let loose on me the justice of the state
251	For thus deluding you.
252	
253	BRABANTIO	Strike on the tinder, ho!
254	Give me a taper! call up all my people!
255	This accident is not unlike my dream:
256	Belief of it oppresses me already.
257	Light, I say! light!
258	
259	[Exit above]
260	
261	IAGO	Farewell; for I must leave you:
262	It seems not meet, nor wholesome to my place,
263	To be produced--as, if I stay, I shall--
264	Against the Moor: for, I do know, the state,
265	However this may gall him with some cheque,
266	Cannot with safety cast him, for he's embark'd
267	With such loud reason to the Cyprus wars,
268	Which even now stand in act, that, for their souls,
269	Another of his fathom they have none,
270	To lead their business: in which regard,
271	Though I do hate him as I do hell-pains.
272	Yet, for necessity of present life,
273	I must show out a flag and sign of love,
274	Which is indeed but sign. That you shall surely find him,
275	Lead to the Sagittary the raised search;
276	And there will I be with him. So, farewell.
277	
278	[Exit]
279	
280	[Enter, below, BRABANTIO, and Servants with torches]
281	
282	BRABANTIO	It is too true an evil: gone she is;
283	And what's to come of my despised time
284	Is nought but bitterness. Now, Roderigo,
285	Where didst thou see her? O unhappy girl!
286	With the Moor, say'st thou? Who would be a father!
287	How didst thou know 'twas she? O she deceives me
288	Past thought! What said she to you? Get more tapers:
289	Raise all my kindred. Are they married, think you?
290	
291	RODERIGO	Truly, I think they are.
292	
293	BRABANTIO	O heaven! How got she out? O treason of the blood!
294	Fathers, from hence trust not your daughters' minds
295	By what you see them act. Is there not charms
296	By which the property of youth and maidhood
297	May be abused? Have you not read, Roderigo,
298	Of some such thing?
299	
300	RODERIGO	Yes, sir, I have indeed.
301	
302	BRABANTIO	Call up my brother. O, would you had had her!
303	Some one way, some another. Do you know
304	Where we may apprehend her and the Moor?
305	
306	RODERIGO	I think I can discover him, if you please,
307	To get good guard and go along with me.
308	
309	BRABANTIO	Pray you, lead on. At every house I'll call;
310	I may command at most. Get weapons, ho!
311	And raise some special officers of night.
312	On, good Roderigo: I'll deserve your pains.
313	
314	[Exeunt]
315	
316	
317	
318	
319	OTHELLO
320	
321	
322	ACT I
323	
324	
325	
326	SCENE II	Another street.
327	
328	
329	[Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Attendants with torches]
330	
331	IAGO	Though in the trade of war I have slain men,
332	Yet do I hold it very stuff o' the conscience
333	To do no contrived murder: I lack iniquity
334	Sometimes to do me service: nine or ten times
335	I had thought to have yerk'd him here under the ribs.
336	
337	OTHELLO	'Tis better as it is.
338	
339	IAGO	Nay, but he prated,
340	
341	And spoke such scurvy and provoking terms
342	Against your honour
343	That, with the little godliness I have,
344	I did full hard forbear him. But, I pray you, sir,
345	Are you fast married? Be assured of this,
346	That the magnifico is much beloved,
347	And hath in his effect a voice potential
348	As double as the duke's: he will divorce you;
349	Or put upon you what restraint and grievance
350	The law, with all his might to enforce it on,
351	Will give him cable.
352	
353	OTHELLO	Let him do his spite:
354	My services which I have done the signiory
355	Shall out-tongue his complaints. 'Tis yet to know,--
356	Which, when I know that boasting is an honour,
357	I shall promulgate--I fetch my life and being
358	From men of royal siege, and my demerits
359	May speak unbonneted to as proud a fortune
360	As this that I have reach'd: for know, Iago,
361	But that I love the gentle Desdemona,
362	I would not my unhoused free condition
363	Put into circumscription and confine
364	For the sea's worth. But, look! what lights come yond?
365	
366	IAGO	Those are the raised father and his friends:
367	You were best go in.
368	
369	OTHELLO	Not I	I must be found:
370	My parts, my title and my perfect soul
371	Shall manifest me rightly. Is it they?
372	
373	IAGO	By Janus, I think no.
374	
375	[Enter CASSIO, and certain Officers with torches]
376	
377	OTHELLO	The servants of the duke, and my lieutenant.
378	The goodness of the night upon you, friends!
379	What is the news?
380	
381	CASSIO	                  The duke does greet you, general,
382	And he requires your haste-post-haste appearance,
383	Even on the instant.
384	
385	OTHELLO	What is the matter, think you?
386	
387	CASSIO	Something from Cyprus as I may divine:
388	It is a business of some heat: the galleys
389	Have sent a dozen sequent messengers
390	This very night at one another's heels,
391	And many of the consuls, raised and met,
392	Are at the duke's already: you have been
393	hotly call'd for;
394	When, being not at your lodging to be found,
395	The senate hath sent about three several guests
396	To search you out.
397	
398	OTHELLO	'Tis well I am found by you.
399	I will but spend a word here in the house,
400	And go with you.
401	
402	[Exit]
403	
404	CASSIO	                  Ancient, what makes he here?
405	
406	IAGO	'Faith, he to-night hath boarded a land carack:
407	If it prove lawful prize, he's made for ever.
408	
409	CASSIO	I do not understand.
410	
411	IAGO	He's married.
412	
413	CASSIO	To who?
414	
415	[Re-enter OTHELLO]
416	
417	IAGO	Marry, to--Come, captain, will you go?
418	
419	OTHELLO	Have with you.
420	
421	CASSIO	Here comes another troop to seek for you.
422	
423	IAGO	It is Brabantio. General, be advised;
424	He comes to bad intent.
425	
426	[Enter BRABANTIO, RODERIGO, and Officers with
427	torches and weapons]
428	
429	OTHELLO	Holla! stand there!
430	
431	RODERIGO	Signior, it is the Moor.
432	
433	BRABANTIO	Down with him, thief!
434	
435	[They draw on both sides]
436	
437	IAGO	You, Roderigo! come, sir, I am for you.
438	
439	OTHELLO	Keep up your bright swords, for the dew will rust them.
440	Good signior, you shall more command with years
441	Than with your weapons.
442	
443	BRABANTIO	O thou foul thief, where hast thou stow'd my daughter?
444	Damn'd as thou art, thou hast enchanted her;
445	For I'll refer me to all things of sense,
446	If she in chains of magic were not bound,
447	Whether a maid so tender, fair and happy,
448	So opposite to marriage that she shunned
449	The wealthy curled darlings of our nation,
450	Would ever have, to incur a general mock,
451	Run from her guardage to the sooty bosom
452	Of such a thing as thou, to fear, not to delight.
453	Judge me the world, if 'tis not gross in sense
454	That thou hast practised on her with foul charms,
455	Abused her delicate youth with drugs or minerals
456	That weaken motion: I'll have't disputed on;
457	'Tis probable and palpable to thinking.
458	I therefore apprehend and do attach thee
459	For an abuser of the world, a practiser
460	Of arts inhibited and out of warrant.
461	Lay hold upon him: if he do resist,
462	Subdue him at his peril.
463	
464	OTHELLO	Hold your hands,
465	Both you of my inclining, and the rest:
466	Were it my cue to fight, I should have known it
467	Without a prompter. Where will you that I go
468	To answer this your charge?
469	
470	BRABANTIO	To prison, till fit time
471	Of law and course of direct session
472	Call thee to answer.
473	
474	OTHELLO	What if I do obey?
475	How may the duke be therewith satisfied,
476	Whose messengers are here about my side,
477	Upon some present business of the state
478	To bring me to him?
479	
480	First Officer	'Tis true, most worthy signior;
481	The duke's in council and your noble self,
482	I am sure, is sent for.
483	
484	BRABANTIO	How! the duke in council!
485	In this time of the night! Bring him away:
486	Mine's not an idle cause: the duke himself,
487	Or any of my brothers of the state,
488	Cannot but feel this wrong as 'twere their own;
489	For if such actions may have passage free,
490	Bond-slaves and pagans shall our statesmen be.
491	
492	[Exeunt]
493	
494	
495	
496	
497	OTHELLO
498	
499	
500	ACT I
501	
502	
503	
504	SCENE III	A council-chamber.
505	
506	
507	[The DUKE and Senators sitting at a table; Officers
508	attending]
509	
510	DUKE OF VENICE	There is no composition in these news
511	That gives them credit.
512	
513	First Senator	Indeed, they are disproportion'd;
514	My letters say a hundred and seven galleys.
515	
516	DUKE OF VENICE	And mine, a hundred and forty.
517	
518	Second Senator	And mine, two hundred:
519	But though they jump not on a just account,--
520	As in these cases, where the aim reports,
521	'Tis oft with difference--yet do they all confirm
522	A Turkish fleet, and bearing up to Cyprus.
523	
524	DUKE OF VENICE	Nay, it is possible enough to judgment:
525	I do not so secure me in the error,
526	But the main article I do approve
527	In fearful sense.
528	
529	Sailor	[Within]  What, ho! what, ho! what, ho!
530	
531	First Officer	A messenger from the galleys.
532	
533	[Enter a Sailor]
534	
535	DUKE OF VENICE	Now, what's the business?
536	
537	Sailor	The Turkish preparation makes for Rhodes;
538	So was I bid report here to the state
539	By Signior Angelo.
540	
541	DUKE OF VENICE	How say you by this change?
542	
543	First Senator	This cannot be,
544	By no assay of reason: 'tis a pageant,
545	To keep us in false gaze. When we consider
546	The importancy of Cyprus to the Turk,
547	And let ourselves again but understand,
548	That as it more concerns the Turk than Rhodes,
549	So may he with more facile question bear it,
550	For that it stands not in such warlike brace,
551	But altogether lacks the abilities
552	That Rhodes is dress'd in: if we make thought of this,
553	We must not think the Turk is so unskilful
554	To leave that latest which concerns him first,
555	Neglecting an attempt of ease and gain,
556	To wake and wage a danger profitless.
557	
558	DUKE OF VENICE	Nay, in all confidence, he's not for Rhodes.
559	
560	First Officer	Here is more news.
561	
562	[Enter a Messenger]
563	
564	Messenger	The Ottomites, reverend and gracious,
565	Steering with due course towards the isle of Rhodes,
566	Have there injointed them with an after fleet.
567	
568	First Senator	Ay, so I thought. How many, as you guess?
569	
570	Messenger	Of thirty sail: and now they do restem
571	Their backward course, bearing with frank appearance
572	Their purposes toward Cyprus. Signior Montano,
573	Your trusty and most valiant servitor,
574	With his free duty recommends you thus,
575	And prays you to believe him.
576	
577	DUKE OF VENICE	'Tis certain, then, for Cyprus.
578	Marcus Luccicos, is not he in town?
579	
580	First Senator	He's now in Florence.
581	
582	DUKE OF VENICE	Write from us to him; post-post-haste dispatch.
583	
584	First Senator	Here comes Brabantio and the valiant Moor.
585	
586	[Enter BRABANTIO, OTHELLO, IAGO, RODERIGO, and Officers]
587	
588	DUKE OF VENICE	Valiant Othello, we must straight employ you
589	Against the general enemy Ottoman.
590	
591	[To BRABANTIO]
592	
593	I did not see you; welcome, gentle signior;
594	We lack'd your counsel and your help tonight.
595	
596	BRABANTIO	So did I yours. Good your grace, pardon me;
597	Neither my place nor aught I heard of business
598	Hath raised me from my bed, nor doth the general care
599	Take hold on me, for my particular grief
600	Is of so flood-gate and o'erbearing nature
601	That it engluts and swallows other sorrows
602	And it is still itself.
603	
604	DUKE OF VENICE	Why, what's the matter?
605	
606	BRABANTIO	My daughter! O, my daughter!
607	
608	
609	DUKE OF VENICE	|	Dead?
610	Senator	|
611	
612	
613	BRABANTIO	Ay, to me;
614	She is abused, stol'n from me, and corrupted
615	By spells and medicines bought of mountebanks;
616	For nature so preposterously to err,
617	Being not deficient, blind, or lame of sense,
618	Sans witchcraft could not.
619	
620	DUKE OF VENICE	Whoe'er he be that in this foul proceeding
621	Hath thus beguiled your daughter of herself
622	And you of her, the bloody book of law
623	You shall yourself read in the bitter letter
624	After your own sense, yea, though our proper son
625	Stood in your action.
626	
627	BRABANTIO	Humbly I thank your grace.
628	Here is the man, this Moor, whom now, it seems,
629	Your special mandate for the state-affairs
630	Hath hither brought.
631	
632	
633	DUKE OF VENICE	|
634	|                 We are very sorry for't.
635	Senator	|
636	
637	
638	DUKE OF VENICE	[To OTHELLO]  What, in your own part, can you say to this?
639	
640	BRABANTIO	Nothing, but this is so.
641	
642	OTHELLO	Most potent, grave, and reverend signiors,
643	My very noble and approved good masters,
644	That I have ta'en away this old man's daughter,
645	It is most true; true, I have married her:
646	The very head and front of my offending
647	Hath this extent, no more. Rude am I in my speech,
648	And little bless'd with the soft phrase of peace:
649	For since these arms of mine had seven years' pith,
650	Till now some nine moons wasted, they have used
651	Their dearest action in the tented field,
652	And little of this great world can I speak,
653	More than pertains to feats of broil and battle,
654	And therefore little shall I grace my cause
655	In speaking for myself. Yet, by your gracious patience,
656	I will a round unvarnish'd tale deliver
657	Of my whole course of love; what drugs, what charms,
658	What conjuration and what mighty magic,
659	For such proceeding I am charged withal,
660	I won his daughter.
661	
662	BRABANTIO	A maiden never bold;
663	Of spirit so still and quiet, that her motion
664	Blush'd at herself; and she, in spite of nature,
665	Of years, of country, credit, every thing,
666	To fall in love with what she fear'd to look on!
667	It is a judgment maim'd and most imperfect
668	That will confess perfection so could err
669	Against all rules of nature, and must be driven
670	To find out practises of cunning hell,
671	Why this should be. I therefore vouch again
672	That with some mixtures powerful o'er the blood,
673	Or with some dram conjured to this effect,
674	He wrought upon her.
675	
676	DUKE OF VENICE	To vouch this, is no proof,
677	Without more wider and more overt test
678	Than these thin habits and poor likelihoods
679	Of modern seeming do prefer against him.
680	
681	First Senator	But, Othello, speak:
682	Did you by indirect and forced courses
683	Subdue and poison this young maid's affections?
684	Or came it by request and such fair question
685	As soul to soul affordeth?
686	
687	OTHELLO	I do beseech you,
688	Send for the lady to the Sagittary,
689	And let her speak of me before her father:
690	If you do find me foul in her report,
691	The trust, the office I do hold of you,
692	Not only take away, but let your sentence
693	Even fall upon my life.
694	
695	DUKE OF VENICE	Fetch Desdemona hither.
696	
697	OTHELLO	Ancient, conduct them: you best know the place.
698	
699	[Exeunt IAGO and Attendants]
700	
701	And, till she come, as truly as to heaven
702	I do confess the vices of my blood,
703	So justly to your grave ears I'll present
704	How I did thrive in this fair lady's love,
705	And she in mine.
706	
707	DUKE OF VENICE	Say it, Othello.
708	
709	OTHELLO	Her father loved me; oft invited me;
710	Still question'd me the story of my life,
711	From year to year, the battles, sieges, fortunes,
712	That I have passed.
713	I ran it through, even from my boyish days,
714	To the very moment that he bade me tell it;
715	Wherein I spake of most disastrous chances,
716	Of moving accidents by flood and field
717	Of hair-breadth scapes i' the imminent deadly breach,
718	Of being taken by the insolent foe
719	And sold to slavery, of my redemption thence
720	And portance in my travels' history:
721	Wherein of antres vast and deserts idle,
722	Rough quarries, rocks and hills whose heads touch heaven
723	It was my hint to speak,--such was the process;
724	And of the Cannibals that each other eat,
725	The Anthropophagi and men whose heads
726	Do grow beneath their shoulders. This to hear
727	Would Desdemona seriously incline:
728	But still the house-affairs would draw her thence:
729	Which ever as she could with haste dispatch,
730	She'ld come again, and with a greedy ear
731	Devour up my discourse: which I observing,
732	Took once a pliant hour, and found good means
733	To draw from her a prayer of earnest heart
734	That I would all my pilgrimage dilate,
735	Whereof by parcels she had something heard,
736	But not intentively: I did consent,
737	And often did beguile her of her tears,
738	When I did speak of some distressful stroke
739	That my youth suffer'd. My story being done,
740	She gave me for my pains a world of sighs:
741	She swore, in faith, twas strange, 'twas passing strange,
742	'Twas pitiful, 'twas wondrous pitiful:
743	She wish'd she had not heard it, yet she wish'd
744	That heaven had made her such a man: she thank'd me,
745	And bade me, if I had a friend that loved her,
746	I should but teach him how to tell my story.
747	And that would woo her. Upon this hint I spake:
748	She loved me for the dangers I had pass'd,
749	And I loved her that she did pity them.
750	This only is the witchcraft I have used:
751	Here comes the lady; let her witness it.
752	
753	[Enter DESDEMONA, IAGO, and Attendants]
754	
755	DUKE OF VENICE	I think this tale would win my daughter too.
756	Good Brabantio,
757	Take up this mangled matter at the best:
758	Men do their broken weapons rather use
759	Than their bare hands.
760	
761	BRABANTIO	I pray you, hear her speak:
762	If she confess that she was half the wooer,
763	Destruction on my head, if my bad blame
764	Light on the man! Come hither, gentle mistress:
765	Do you perceive in all this noble company
766	Where most you owe obedience?
767	
768	DESDEMONA	My noble father,
769	I do perceive here a divided duty:
770	To you I am bound for life and education;
771	My life and education both do learn me
772	How to respect you; you are the lord of duty;
773	I am hitherto your daughter: but here's my husband,
774	And so much duty as my mother show'd
775	To you, preferring you before her father,
776	So much I challenge that I may profess
777	Due to the Moor my lord.
778	
779	BRABANTIO	God be wi' you! I have done.
780	Please it your grace, on to the state-affairs:
781	I had rather to adopt a child than get it.
782	Come hither, Moor:
783	I here do give thee that with all my heart
784	Which, but thou hast already, with all my heart
785	I would keep from thee. For your sake, jewel,
786	I am glad at soul I have no other child:
787	For thy escape would teach me tyranny,
788	To hang clogs on them. I have done, my lord.
789	
790	DUKE OF VENICE	Let me speak like yourself, and lay a sentence,
791	Which, as a grise or step, may help these lovers
792	Into your favour.
793	When remedies are past, the griefs are ended
794	By seeing the worst, which late on hopes depended.
795	To mourn a mischief that is past and gone
796	Is the next way to draw new mischief on.
797	What cannot be preserved when fortune takes
798	Patience her injury a mockery makes.
799	The robb'd that smiles steals something from the thief;
800	He robs himself that spends a bootless grief.
801	
802	BRABANTIO	So let the Turk of Cyprus us beguile;
803	We lose it not, so long as we can smile.
804	He bears the sentence well that nothing bears
805	But the free comfort which from thence he hears,
806	But he bears both the sentence and the sorrow
807	That, to pay grief, must of poor patience borrow.
808	These sentences, to sugar, or to gall,
809	Being strong on both sides, are equivocal:
810	But words are words; I never yet did hear
811	That the bruised heart was pierced through the ear.
812	I humbly beseech you, proceed to the affairs of state.
813	
814	DUKE OF VENICE	The Turk with a most mighty preparation makes for
815	Cyprus. Othello, the fortitude of the place is best
816	known to you; and though we have there a substitute
817	of most allowed sufficiency, yet opinion, a
818	sovereign mistress of effects, throws a more safer
819	voice on you: you must therefore be content to
820	slubber the gloss of your new fortunes with this
821	more stubborn and boisterous expedition.
822	
823	OTHELLO	The tyrant custom, most grave senators,
824	Hath made the flinty and steel couch of war
825	My thrice-driven bed of down: I do agnise
826	A natural and prompt alacrity
827	I find in hardness, and do undertake
828	These present wars against the Ottomites.
829	Most humbly therefore bending to your state,
830	I crave fit disposition for my wife.
831	Due reference of place and exhibition,
832	With such accommodation and besort
833	As levels with her breeding.
834	
835	DUKE OF VENICE	If you please,
836	Be't at her father's.
837	
838	BRABANTIO	I'll not have it so.
839	
840	OTHELLO	Nor I.
841	
842	DESDEMONA	     Nor I; I would not there reside,
843	To put my father in impatient thoughts
844	By being in his eye. Most gracious duke,
845	To my unfolding lend your prosperous ear;
846	And let me find a charter in your voice,
847	To assist my simpleness.
848	
849	DUKE OF VENICE	What would You, Desdemona?
850	
851	DESDEMONA	That I did love the Moor to live with him,
852	My downright violence and storm of fortunes
853	May trumpet to the world: my heart's subdued
854	Even to the very quality of my lord:
855	I saw Othello's visage in his mind,
856	And to his honour and his valiant parts
857	Did I my soul and fortunes consecrate.
858	So that, dear lords, if I be left behind,
859	A moth of peace, and he go to the war,
860	The rites for which I love him are bereft me,
861	And I a heavy interim shall support
862	By his dear absence. Let me go with him.
863	
864	OTHELLO	Let her have your voices.
865	Vouch with me, heaven, I therefore beg it not,
866	To please the palate of my appetite,
867	Nor to comply with heat--the young affects
868	In me defunct--and proper satisfaction.
869	But to be free and bounteous to her mind:
870	And heaven defend your good souls, that you think
871	I will your serious and great business scant
872	For she is with me: no, when light-wing'd toys
873	Of feather'd Cupid seal with wanton dullness
874	My speculative and officed instruments,
875	That my disports corrupt and taint my business,
876	Let housewives make a skillet of my helm,
877	And all indign and base adversities
878	Make head against my estimation!
879	
880	DUKE OF VENICE	Be it as you shall privately determine,
881	Either for her stay or going: the affair cries haste,
882	And speed must answer it.
883	
884	First Senator	You must away to-night.
885	
886	OTHELLO	With all my heart.
887	
888	DUKE OF VENICE	At nine i' the morning here we'll meet again.
889	Othello, leave some officer behind,
890	And he shall our commission bring to you;
891	With such things else of quality and respect
892	As doth import you.
893	
894	OTHELLO	So please your grace, my ancient;
895	A man he is of honest and trust:
896	To his conveyance I assign my wife,
897	With what else needful your good grace shall think
898	To be sent after me.
899	
900	DUKE OF VENICE	Let it be so.
901	Good night to every one.
902	
903	[To BRABANTIO]
904	
905	And, noble signior,
906	If virtue no delighted beauty lack,
907	Your son-in-law is far more fair than black.
908	
909	First Senator	Adieu, brave Moor, use Desdemona well.
910	
911	BRABANTIO	Look to her, Moor, if thou hast eyes to see:
912	She has deceived her father, and may thee.
913	
914	[Exeunt DUKE OF VENICE, Senators, Officers, &c]
915	
916	OTHELLO	My life upon her faith! Honest Iago,
917	My Desdemona must I leave to thee:
918	I prithee, let thy wife attend on her:
919	And bring them after in the best advantage.
920	
921	Come, Desdemona: I have but an hour
922	Of love, of worldly matters and direction,
923	To spend with thee: we must obey the time.
924	
925	[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]
926	
927	RODERIGO	Iago,--
928	
929	IAGO	What say'st thou, noble heart?
930	
931	RODERIGO	What will I do, thinkest thou?
932	
933	IAGO	Why, go to bed, and sleep.
934	
935	RODERIGO	I will incontinently drown myself.
936	
937	IAGO	If thou dost, I shall never love thee after. Why,
938	thou silly gentleman!
939	
940	RODERIGO	It is silliness to live when to live is torment; and
941	then have we a prescription to die when death is our physician.
942	
943	IAGO	O villainous! I have looked upon the world for four
944	times seven years; and since I could distinguish
945	betwixt a benefit and an injury, I never found man
946	that knew how to love himself. Ere I would say, I
947	would drown myself for the love of a guinea-hen, I
948	would change my humanity with a baboon.
949	
950	RODERIGO	What should I do? I confess it is my shame to be so
951	fond; but it is not in my virtue to amend it.
952	
953	IAGO	Virtue! a fig! 'tis in ourselves that we are thus
954	or thus. Our bodies are our gardens, to the which
955	our wills are gardeners: so that if we will plant
956	nettles, or sow lettuce, set hyssop and weed up
957	thyme, supply it with one gender of herbs, or
958	distract it with many, either to have it sterile
959	with idleness, or manured with industry, why, the
960	power and corrigible authority of this lies in our
961	wills. If the balance of our lives had not one
962	scale of reason to poise another of sensuality, the
963	blood and baseness of our natures would conduct us
964	to most preposterous conclusions: but we have
965	reason to cool our raging motions, our carnal
966	stings, our unbitted lusts, whereof I take this that
967	you call love to be a sect or scion.
968	
969	RODERIGO	It cannot be.
970	
971	IAGO	It is merely a lust of the blood and a permission of
972	the will. Come, be a man. Drown thyself! drown
973	cats and blind puppies. I have professed me thy
974	friend and I confess me knit to thy deserving with
975	cables of perdurable toughness; I could never
976	better stead thee than now. Put money in thy
977	purse; follow thou the wars; defeat thy favour with
978	an usurped beard; I say, put money in thy purse. It
979	cannot be that Desdemona should long continue her
980	love to the Moor,-- put money in thy purse,--nor he
981	his to her: it was a violent commencement, and thou
982	shalt see an answerable sequestration:--put but
983	money in thy purse. These Moors are changeable in
984	their wills: fill thy purse with money:--the food
985	that to him now is as luscious as locusts, shall be
986	to him shortly as bitter as coloquintida. She must
987	change for youth: when she is sated with his body,
988	she will find the error of her choice: she must
989	have change, she must: therefore put money in thy
990	purse. If thou wilt needs damn thyself, do it a
991	more delicate way than drowning. Make all the money
992	thou canst: if sanctimony and a frail vow betwixt
993	an erring barbarian and a supersubtle Venetian not
994	too hard for my wits and all the tribe of hell, thou
995	shalt enjoy her; therefore make money. A pox of
996	drowning thyself! it is clean out of the way: seek
997	thou rather to be hanged in compassing thy joy than
998	to be drowned and go without her.
999	
1000	RODERIGO	Wilt thou be fast to my hopes, if I depend on
1001	the issue?
1002	
1003	IAGO	Thou art sure of me:--go, make money:--I have told
1004	thee often, and I re-tell thee again and again, I
1005	hate the Moor: my cause is hearted; thine hath no
1006	less reason. Let us be conjunctive in our revenge
1007	against him: if thou canst cuckold him, thou dost
1008	thyself a pleasure, me a sport. There are many
1009	events in the womb of time which will be delivered.
1010	Traverse! go, provide thy money. We will have more
1011	of this to-morrow. Adieu.
1012	
1013	RODERIGO	Where shall we meet i' the morning?
1014	
1015	IAGO	At my lodging.
1016	
1017	RODERIGO	I'll be with thee betimes.
1018	
1019	IAGO	Go to; farewell. Do you hear, Roderigo?
1020	
1021	RODERIGO	What say you?
1022	
1023	IAGO	No more of drowning, do you hear?
1024	
1025	RODERIGO	I am changed: I'll go sell all my land.
1026	
1027	[Exit]
1028	
1029	IAGO	Thus do I ever make my fool my purse:
1030	For I mine own gain'd knowledge should profane,
1031	If I would time expend with such a snipe.
1032	But for my sport and profit. I hate the Moor:
1033	And it is thought abroad, that 'twixt my sheets
1034	He has done my office: I know not if't be true;
1035	But I, for mere suspicion in that kind,
1036	Will do as if for surety. He holds me well;
1037	The better shall my purpose work on him.
1038	Cassio's a proper man: let me see now:
1039	To get his place and to plume up my will
1040	In double knavery--How, how? Let's see:--
1041	After some time, to abuse Othello's ear
1042	That he is too familiar with his wife.
1043	He hath a person and a smooth dispose
1044	To be suspected, framed to make women false.
1045	The Moor is of a free and open nature,
1046	That thinks men honest that but seem to be so,
1047	And will as tenderly be led by the nose
1048	As asses are.
1049	I have't. It is engender'd. Hell and night
1050	Must bring this monstrous birth to the world's light.
1051

1060	ACT II
1061	
1062	
1063	
1064	SCENE I	A Sea-port in Cyprus. An open place near the quay.
1065	
1066	
1067	[Enter MONTANO and two Gentlemen]
1068	
1069	MONTANO	What from the cape can you discern at sea?
1070	
1071	First Gentleman	Nothing at all: it is a highwrought flood;
1072	I cannot, 'twixt the heaven and the main,
1073	Descry a sail.
1074	
1075	MONTANO	Methinks the wind hath spoke aloud at land;
1076	A fuller blast ne'er shook our battlements:
1077	If it hath ruffian'd so upon the sea,
1078	What ribs of oak, when mountains melt on them,
1079	Can hold the mortise? What shall we hear of this?
1080	
1081	Second Gentleman	A segregation of the Turkish fleet:
1082	
1083	For do but stand upon the foaming shore,
1084	The chidden billow seems to pelt the clouds;
1085	The wind-shaked surge, with high and monstrous mane,
1086	seems to cast water on the burning bear,
1087	And quench the guards of the ever-fixed pole:
1088	I never did like molestation view
1089	On the enchafed flood.
1090	
1091	MONTANO	If that the Turkish fleet
1092	Be not enshelter'd and embay'd, they are drown'd:
1093	It is impossible they bear it out.
1094	
1095	[Enter a third Gentleman]
1096	
1097	Third Gentleman	News, lads! our wars are done.
1098	The desperate tempest hath so bang'd the Turks,
1099	That their designment halts: a noble ship of Venice
1100	Hath seen a grievous wreck and sufferance
1101	On most part of their fleet.
1102	
1103	MONTANO	How! is this true?
1104	
1105	Third Gentleman	The ship is here put in,
1106	A Veronesa; Michael Cassio,
1107	Lieutenant to the warlike Moor Othello,
1108	Is come on shore: the Moor himself at sea,
1109	And is in full commission here for Cyprus.
1110	
1111	MONTANO	I am glad on't; 'tis a worthy governor.
1112	
1113	Third Gentleman	But this same Cassio, though he speak of comfort
1114	Touching the Turkish loss, yet he looks sadly,
1115	And prays the Moor be safe; for they were parted
1116	With foul and violent tempest.
1117	
1118	MONTANO	Pray heavens he be;
1119	For I have served him, and the man commands
1120	Like a full soldier. Let's to the seaside, ho!
1121	As well to see the vessel that's come in
1122	As to throw out our eyes for brave Othello,
1123	Even till we make the main and the aerial blue
1124	An indistinct regard.
1125	
1126	Third Gentleman	Come, let's do so:
1127	For every minute is expectancy
1128	Of more arrivance.
1129	
1130	[Enter CASSIO]
1131	
1132	CASSIO	Thanks, you the valiant of this warlike isle,
1133	That so approve the Moor! O, let the heavens
1134	Give him defence against the elements,
1135	For I have lost us him on a dangerous sea.
1136	
1137	MONTANO	Is he well shipp'd?
1138	
1139	CASSIO	His bark is stoutly timber'd, his pilot
1140	Of very expert and approved allowance;
1141	Therefore my hopes, not surfeited to death,
1142	Stand in bold cure.
1143	
1144	[A cry within 'A sail, a sail, a sail!']
1145	
1146	[Enter a fourth Gentleman]
1147	
1148	CASSIO	What noise?
1149	
1150	Fourth Gentleman	The town is empty; on the brow o' the sea
1151	Stand ranks of people, and they cry 'A sail!'
1152	
1153	CASSIO	My hopes do shape him for the governor.
1154	
1155	[Guns heard]
1156	
1157	Second Gentlemen	They do discharge their shot of courtesy:
1158	Our friends at least.
1159	
1160	CASSIO	I pray you, sir, go forth,
1161	And give us truth who 'tis that is arrived.
1162	
1163	Second Gentleman	I shall.
1164	
1165	[Exit]
1166	
1167	MONTANO	But, good lieutenant, is your general wived?
1168	
1169	CASSIO	Most fortunately: he hath achieved a maid
1170	That paragons description and wild fame;
1171	One that excels the quirks of blazoning pens,
1172	And in the essential vesture of creation
1173	Does tire the ingener.
1174	
1175	[Re-enter second Gentleman]
1176	
1177	How now! who has put in?
1178	
1179	Second Gentleman	'Tis one Iago, ancient to the general.
1180	
1181	CASSIO	Has had most favourable and happy speed:
1182	Tempests themselves, high seas, and howling winds,
1183	The gutter'd rocks and congregated sands--
1184	Traitors ensteep'd to clog the guiltless keel,--
1185	As having sense of beauty, do omit
1186	Their mortal natures, letting go safely by
1187	The divine Desdemona.
1188	
1189	MONTANO	What is she?
1190	
1191	CASSIO	She that I spake of, our great captain's captain,
1192	Left in the conduct of the bold Iago,
1193	Whose footing here anticipates our thoughts
1194	A se'nnight's speed. Great Jove, Othello guard,
1195	And swell his sail with thine own powerful breath,
1196	That he may bless this bay with his tall ship,
1197	Make love's quick pants in Desdemona's arms,
1198	Give renew'd fire to our extincted spirits
1199	And bring all Cyprus comfort!
1200	
1201	[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, IAGO, RODERIGO, and
1202	Attendants]
1203	
1204	O, behold,
1205	The riches of the ship is come on shore!
1206	Ye men of Cyprus, let her have your knees.
1207	Hail to thee, lady! and the grace of heaven,
1208	Before, behind thee, and on every hand,
1209	Enwheel thee round!
1210	
1211	DESDEMONA	I thank you, valiant Cassio.
1212	What tidings can you tell me of my lord?
1213	
1214	CASSIO	He is not yet arrived: nor know I aught
1215	But that he's well and will be shortly here.
1216	
1217	DESDEMONA	O, but I fear--How lost you company?
1218	
1219	CASSIO	The great contention of the sea and skies
1220	Parted our fellowship--But, hark! a sail.
1221	
1222	[Within 'A sail, a sail!' Guns heard]
1223	
1224	Second Gentleman	They give their greeting to the citadel;
1225	This likewise is a friend.
1226	
1227	CASSIO	See for the news.
1228	
1229	[Exit Gentleman]
1230	
1231	Good ancient, you are welcome.
1232	
1233	[To EMILIA]
1234	
1235	Welcome, mistress.
1236	Let it not gall your patience, good Iago,
1237	That I extend my manners; 'tis my breeding
1238	That gives me this bold show of courtesy.
1239	
1240	[Kissing her]
1241	
1242	IAGO	Sir, would she give you so much of her lips
1243	As of her tongue she oft bestows on me,
1244	You'll have enough.
1245	
1246	DESDEMONA	Alas, she has no speech.
1247	
1248	IAGO	In faith, too much;
1249	I find it still, when I have list to sleep:
1250	Marry, before your ladyship, I grant,
1251	She puts her tongue a little in her heart,
1252	And chides with thinking.
1253	
1254	EMILIA	You have little cause to say so.
1255	
1256	IAGO	Come on, come on; you are pictures out of doors,
1257	Bells in your parlors, wild-cats in your kitchens,
1258	Saints m your injuries, devils being offended,
1259	Players in your housewifery, and housewives' in your beds.
1260	
1261	DESDEMONA	O, fie upon thee, slanderer!
1262	
1263	IAGO	Nay, it is true, or else I am a Turk:
1264	You rise to play and go to bed to work.
1265	
1266	EMILIA	You shall not write my praise.
1267	
1268	IAGO	No, let me not.
1269	
1270	DESDEMONA	What wouldst thou write of me, if thou shouldst
1271	praise me?
1272	
1273	IAGO	O gentle lady, do not put me to't;
1274	For I am nothing, if not critical.
1275	
1276	DESDEMONA	Come on assay. There's one gone to the harbour?
1277	
1278	IAGO	Ay, madam.
1279	
1280	DESDEMONA	I am not merry; but I do beguile
1281	The thing I am, by seeming otherwise.
1282	Come, how wouldst thou praise me?
1283	
1284	IAGO	I am about it; but indeed my invention
1285	Comes from my pate as birdlime does from frize;
1286	It plucks out brains and all: but my Muse labours,
1287	And thus she is deliver'd.
1288	If she be fair and wise, fairness and wit,
1289	The one's for use, the other useth it.
1290	
1291	DESDEMONA	Well praised! How if she be black and witty?
1292	
1293	IAGO	If she be black, and thereto have a wit,
1294	She'll find a white that shall her blackness fit.
1295	
1296	DESDEMONA	Worse and worse.
1297	
1298	EMILIA	How if fair and foolish?
1299	
1300	IAGO	She never yet was foolish that was fair;
1301	For even her folly help'd her to an heir.
1302	
1303	DESDEMONA	These are old fond paradoxes to make fools laugh i'
1304	the alehouse. What miserable praise hast thou for
1305	her that's foul and foolish?
1306	
1307	IAGO	There's none so foul and foolish thereunto,
1308	But does foul pranks which fair and wise ones do.
1309	
1310	DESDEMONA	O heavy ignorance! thou praisest the worst best.
1311	But what praise couldst thou bestow on a deserving
1312	woman indeed, one that, in the authority of her
1313	merit, did justly put on the vouch of very malice itself?
1314	
1315	IAGO	She that was ever fair and never proud,
1316	Had tongue at will and yet was never loud,
1317	Never lack'd gold and yet went never gay,
1318	Fled from her wish and yet said 'Now I may,'
1319	She that being anger'd, her revenge being nigh,
1320	Bade her wrong stay and her displeasure fly,
1321	She that in wisdom never was so frail
1322	To change the cod's head for the salmon's tail;
1323	She that could think and ne'er disclose her mind,
1324	See suitors following and not look behind,
1325	She was a wight, if ever such wight were,--
1326	
1327	DESDEMONA	To do what?
1328	
1329	IAGO	To suckle fools and chronicle small beer.
1330	
1331	DESDEMONA	O most lame and impotent conclusion! Do not learn
1332	of him, Emilia, though he be thy husband. How say
1333	you, Cassio? is he not a most profane and liberal
1334	counsellor?
1335	
1336	CASSIO	He speaks home, madam: You may relish him more in
1337	the soldier than in the scholar.
1338	
1339	IAGO	[Aside]  He takes her by the palm: ay, well said,
1340	whisper: with as little a web as this will I
1341	ensnare as great a fly as Cassio. Ay, smile upon
1342	her, do; I will gyve thee in thine own courtship.
1343	You say true; 'tis so, indeed: if such tricks as
1344	these strip you out of your lieutenantry, it had
1345	been better you had not kissed your three fingers so
1346	oft, which now again you are most apt to play the
1347	sir in. Very good; well kissed! an excellent
1348	courtesy! 'tis so, indeed. Yet again your fingers
1349	to your lips? would they were clyster-pipes for your sake!
1350	
1351	[Trumpet within]
1352	
1353	The Moor! I know his trumpet.
1354	
1355	CASSIO	'Tis truly so.
1356	
1357	DESDEMONA	Let's meet him and receive him.
1358	
1359	CASSIO	Lo, where he comes!
1360	
1361	[Enter OTHELLO and Attendants]
1362	
1363	OTHELLO	O my fair warrior!
1364	
1365	DESDEMONA	                  My dear Othello!
1366	
1367	OTHELLO	It gives me wonder great as my content
1368	To see you here before me. O my soul's joy!
1369	If after every tempest come such calms,
1370	May the winds blow till they have waken'd death!
1371	And let the labouring bark climb hills of seas
1372	Olympus-high and duck again as low
1373	As hell's from heaven! If it were now to die,
1374	'Twere now to be most happy; for, I fear,
1375	My soul hath her content so absolute
1376	That not another comfort like to this
1377	Succeeds in unknown fate.
1378	
1379	DESDEMONA	The heavens forbid
1380	But that our loves and comforts should increase,
1381	Even as our days do grow!
1382	
1383	OTHELLO	Amen to that, sweet powers!
1384	I cannot speak enough of this content;
1385	It stops me here; it is too much of joy:
1386	And this, and this, the greatest discords be
1387	
1388	[Kissing her]
1389	
1390	That e'er our hearts shall make!
1391	
1392	IAGO	[Aside]  O, you are well tuned now!
1393	But I'll set down the pegs that make this music,
1394	As honest as I am.
1395	
1396	OTHELLO	                  Come, let us to the castle.
1397	News, friends; our wars are done, the Turks
1398	are drown'd.
1399	How does my old acquaintance of this isle?
1400	Honey, you shall be well desired in Cyprus;
1401	I have found great love amongst them. O my sweet,
1402	I prattle out of fashion, and I dote
1403	In mine own comforts. I prithee, good Iago,
1404	Go to the bay and disembark my coffers:
1405	Bring thou the master to the citadel;
1406	He is a good one, and his worthiness
1407	Does challenge much respect. Come, Desdemona,
1408	Once more, well met at Cyprus.
1409	
1410	[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]
1411	
1412	IAGO	Do thou meet me presently at the harbour. Come
1413	hither. If thou be'st valiant,-- as, they say, base
1414	men being in love have then a nobility in their
1415	natures more than is native to them--list me. The
1416	lieutenant tonight watches on the court of
1417	guard:--first, I must tell thee this--Desdemona is
1418	directly in love with him.
1419	
1420	
1421	RODERIGO	With him! why, 'tis not possible.
1422	
1423	IAGO	Lay thy finger thus, and let thy soul be instructed.
1424	Mark me with what violence she first loved the Moor,
1425	but for bragging and telling her fantastical lies:
1426	and will she love him still for prating? let not
1427	thy discreet heart think it. Her eye must be fed;
1428	and what delight shall she have to look on the
1429	devil? When the blood is made dull with the act of
1430	sport, there should be, again to inflame it and to
1431	give satiety a fresh appetite, loveliness in favour,
1432	sympathy in years, manners and beauties; all which
1433	the Moor is defective in: now, for want of these
1434	required conveniences, her delicate tenderness will
1435	find itself abused, begin to heave the gorge,
1436	disrelish and abhor the Moor; very nature will
1437	instruct her in it and compel her to some second
1438	choice. Now, sir, this granted,--as it is a most
1439	pregnant and unforced position--who stands so
1440	eminent in the degree of this fortune as Cassio
1441	does? a knave very voluble; no further
1442	conscionable than in putting on the mere form of
1443	civil and humane seeming, for the better compassing
1444	of his salt and most hidden loose affection? why,
1445	none; why, none: a slipper and subtle knave, a
1446	finder of occasions, that has an eye can stamp and
1447	counterfeit advantages, though true advantage never
1448	present itself; a devilish knave. Besides, the
1449	knave is handsome, young, and hath all those
1450	requisites in him that folly and green minds look
1451	after: a pestilent complete knave; and the woman
1452	hath found him already.
1453	
1454	RODERIGO	I cannot believe that in her; she's full of
1455	most blessed condition.
1456	
1457	IAGO	Blessed fig's-end! the wine she drinks is made of
1458	grapes: if she had been blessed, she would never
1459	have loved the Moor. Blessed pudding! Didst thou
1460	not see her paddle with the palm of his hand? didst
1461	not mark that?
1462	
1463	RODERIGO	Yes, that I did; but that was but courtesy.
1464	
1465	IAGO	Lechery, by this hand; an index and obscure prologue
1466	to the history of lust and foul thoughts. They met
1467	so near with their lips that their breaths embraced
1468	together. Villanous thoughts, Roderigo! when these
1469	mutualities so marshal the way, hard at hand comes
1470	the master and main exercise, the incorporate
1471	conclusion, Pish! But, sir, be you ruled by me: I
1472	have brought you from Venice. Watch you to-night;
1473	for the command, I'll lay't upon you. Cassio knows
1474	you not. I'll not be far from you: do you find
1475	some occasion to anger Cassio, either by speaking
1476	too loud, or tainting his discipline; or from what
1477	other course you please, which the time shall more
1478	favourably minister.
1479	
1480	RODERIGO	Well.
1481	
1482	IAGO	Sir, he is rash and very sudden in choler, and haply
1483	may strike at you: provoke him, that he may; for
1484	even out of that will I cause these of Cyprus to
1485	mutiny; whose qualification shall come into no true
1486	taste again but by the displanting of Cassio. So
1487	shall you have a shorter journey to your desires by
1488	the means I shall then have to prefer them; and the
1489	impediment most profitably removed, without the
1490	which there were no expectation of our prosperity.
1491	
1492	RODERIGO	I will do this, if I can bring it to any
1493	opportunity.
1494	
1495	IAGO	I warrant thee. Meet me by and by at the citadel:
1496	I must fetch his necessaries ashore. Farewell.
1497	
1498	RODERIGO	Adieu.
1499	
1500	[Exit]
1501	
1502	IAGO	That Cassio loves her, I do well believe it;
1503	That she loves him, 'tis apt and of great credit:
1504	The Moor, howbeit that I endure him not,
1505	Is of a constant, loving, noble nature,
1506	And I dare think he'll prove to Desdemona
1507	A most dear husband. Now, I do love her too;
1508	Not out of absolute lust, though peradventure
1509	I stand accountant for as great a sin,
1510	But partly led to diet my revenge,
1511	For that I do suspect the lusty Moor
1512	Hath leap'd into my seat; the thought whereof
1513	Doth, like a poisonous mineral, gnaw my inwards;
1514	And nothing can or shall content my soul
1515	Till I am even'd with him, wife for wife,
1516	Or failing so, yet that I put the Moor
1517	At least into a jealousy so strong
1518	That judgment cannot cure. Which thing to do,
1519	If this poor trash of Venice, whom I trash
1520	For his quick hunting, stand the putting on,
1521	I'll have our Michael Cassio on the hip,
1522	Abuse him to the Moor in the rank garb--
1523	For I fear Cassio with my night-cap too--
1524	Make the Moor thank me, love me and reward me.
1525	For making him egregiously an ass
1526	And practising upon his peace and quiet
1527	Even to madness. 'Tis here, but yet confused:
1528	Knavery's plain face is never seen tin used.

1545	[Enter a Herald with a proclamation; People
1546	following]
1547	
1548	Herald	It is Othello's pleasure, our noble and valiant
1549	general, that, upon certain tidings now arrived,
1550	importing the mere perdition of the Turkish fleet,
1551	every man put himself into triumph; some to dance,
1552	some to make bonfires, each man to what sport and
1553	revels his addiction leads him: for, besides these
1554	beneficial news, it is the celebration of his
1555	nuptial. So much was his pleasure should be
1556	proclaimed. All offices are open, and there is full
1557	liberty of feasting from this present hour of five
1558	till the bell have told eleven. Heaven bless the
1559	isle of Cyprus and our noble general Othello!

1574	
1575	
1576	[Enter OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and Attendants]
1577	
1578	OTHELLO	Good Michael, look you to the guard to-night:
1579	Let's teach ourselves that honourable stop,
1580	Not to outsport discretion.
1581	
1582	CASSIO	Iago hath direction what to do;
1583	But, notwithstanding, with my personal eye
1584	Will I look to't.
1585	
1586	OTHELLO	                  Iago is most honest.
1587	Michael, good night: to-morrow with your earliest
1588	Let me have speech with you.
1589	
1590	[To DESDEMONA]
1591	
1592	Come, my dear love,
1593	The purchase made, the fruits are to ensue;
1594	That profit's yet to come 'tween me and you.
1595	Good night.
1596	
1597	[Exeunt OTHELLO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]
1598	
1599	[Enter IAGO]
1600	
1601	CASSIO	Welcome, Iago; we must to the watch.
1602	
1603	IAGO	Not this hour, lieutenant; 'tis not yet ten o' the
1604	clock. Our general cast us thus early for the love
1605	of his Desdemona; who let us not therefore blame:
1606	he hath not yet made wanton the night with her; and
1607	she is sport for Jove.
1608	
1609	CASSIO	She's a most exquisite lady.
1610	
1611	IAGO	And, I'll warrant her, fun of game.
1612	
1613	CASSIO	Indeed, she's a most fresh and delicate creature.
1614	
1615	IAGO	What an eye she has! methinks it sounds a parley of
1616	provocation.
1617	
1618	CASSIO	An inviting eye; and yet methinks right modest.
1619	
1620	IAGO	And when she speaks, is it not an alarum to love?
1621	
1622	CASSIO	She is indeed perfection.
1623	
1624	IAGO	Well, happiness to their sheets! Come, lieutenant, I
1625	have a stoup of wine; and here without are a brace
1626	of Cyprus gallants that would fain have a measure to
1627	the health of black Othello.
1628	
1629	CASSIO	Not to-night, good Iago: I have very poor and
1630	unhappy brains for drinking: I could well wish
1631	courtesy would invent some other custom of
1632	entertainment.
1633	
1634	IAGO	O, they are our friends; but one cup: I'll drink for
1635	you.
1636	
1637	CASSIO	I have drunk but one cup to-night, and that was
1638	craftily qualified too, and, behold, what innovation
1639	it makes here: I am unfortunate in the infirmity,
1640	and dare not task my weakness with any more.
1641	
1642	IAGO	What, man! 'tis a night of revels: the gallants
1643	desire it.
1644	
1645	CASSIO	Where are they?
1646	
1647	IAGO	Here at the door; I pray you, call them in.
1648	
1649	CASSIO	I'll do't; but it dislikes me.
1650	
1651	[Exit]
1652	
1653	IAGO	If I can fasten but one cup upon him,
1654	With that which he hath drunk to-night already,
1655	He'll be as full of quarrel and offence
1656	As my young mistress' dog. Now, my sick fool Roderigo,
1657	Whom love hath turn'd almost the wrong side out,
1658	To Desdemona hath to-night caroused
1659	Potations pottle-deep; and he's to watch:
1660	Three lads of Cyprus, noble swelling spirits,
1661	That hold their honours in a wary distance,
1662	The very elements of this warlike isle,
1663	Have I to-night fluster'd with flowing cups,
1664	And they watch too. Now, 'mongst this flock of drunkards,
1665	Am I to put our Cassio in some action
1666	That may offend the isle.--But here they come:
1667	If consequence do but approve my dream,
1668	My boat sails freely, both with wind and stream.
1669	
1670	[Re-enter CASSIO; with him MONTANO and Gentlemen;
1671	servants following with wine]
1672	
1673	CASSIO	'Fore God, they have given me a rouse already.
1674	
1675	MONTANO	Good faith, a little one; not past a pint, as I am
1676	a soldier.
1677	
1678	IAGO	Some wine, ho!
1679	
1680	[Sings]
1681	
1682	And let me the canakin clink, clink;
1683	And let me the canakin clink
1684	A soldier's a man;
1685	A life's but a span;
1686	Why, then, let a soldier drink.
1687	Some wine, boys!
1688	
1689	CASSIO	'Fore God, an excellent song.
1690	
1691	IAGO	I learned it in England, where, indeed, they are
1692	most potent in potting: your Dane, your German, and
1693	your swag-bellied Hollander--Drink, ho!--are nothing
1694	to your English.
1695	
1696	CASSIO	Is your Englishman so expert in his drinking?
1697	
1698	IAGO	Why, he drinks you, with facility, your Dane dead
1699	drunk; he sweats not to overthrow your Almain; he
1700	gives your Hollander a vomit, ere the next pottle
1701	can be filled.
1702	
1703	CASSIO	To the health of our general!
1704	
1705	MONTANO	I am for it, lieutenant; and I'll do you justice.
1706	
1707	IAGO	O sweet England!
1708	King Stephen was a worthy peer,
1709	His breeches cost him but a crown;
1710	He held them sixpence all too dear,
1711	With that he call'd the tailor lown.
1712	He was a wight of high renown,
1713	And thou art but of low degree:
1714	'Tis pride that pulls the country down;
1715	Then take thine auld cloak about thee.
1716	Some wine, ho!
1717	
1718	CASSIO	Why, this is a more exquisite song than the other.
1719	
1720	IAGO	Will you hear't again?
1721	
1722	CASSIO	No; for I hold him to be unworthy of his place that
1723	does those things. Well, God's above all; and there
1724	be souls must be saved, and there be souls must not be saved.
1725	
1726	IAGO	It's true, good lieutenant.
1727	
1728	CASSIO	For mine own part,--no offence to the general, nor
1729	any man of quality,--I hope to be saved.
1730	
1731	IAGO	And so do I too, lieutenant.
1732	
1733	CASSIO	Ay, but, by your leave, not before me; the
1734	lieutenant is to be saved before the ancient. Let's
1735	have no more of this; let's to our affairs.--Forgive
1736	us our sins!--Gentlemen, let's look to our business.
1737	Do not think, gentlemen. I am drunk: this is my
1738	ancient; this is my right hand, and this is my left:
1739	I am not drunk now; I can stand well enough, and
1740	speak well enough.
1741	
1742	All	Excellent well.
1743	
1744	CASSIO	Why, very well then; you must not think then that I am drunk.
1745	
1746	[Exit]
1747	
1748	MONTANO	To the platform, masters; come, let's set the watch.
1749	
1750	IAGO	You see this fellow that is gone before;
1751	He is a soldier fit to stand by Caesar
1752	And give direction: and do but see his vice;
1753	'Tis to his virtue a just equinox,
1754	The one as long as the other: 'tis pity of him.
1755	I fear the trust Othello puts him in.
1756	On some odd time of his infirmity,
1757	Will shake this island.
1758	
1759	MONTANO	But is he often thus?
1760	
1761	IAGO	'Tis evermore the prologue to his sleep:
1762	He'll watch the horologe a double set,
1763	If drink rock not his cradle.
1764	
1765	MONTANO	It were well
1766	The general were put in mind of it.
1767	Perhaps he sees it not; or his good nature
1768	Prizes the virtue that appears in Cassio,
1769	And looks not on his evils: is not this true?
1770	
1771	[Enter RODERIGO]
1772	
1773	IAGO	[Aside to him]  How now, Roderigo!
1774	I pray you, after the lieutenant; go.
1775	
1776	[Exit RODERIGO]
1777	
1778	MONTANO	And 'tis great pity that the noble Moor
1779	Should hazard such a place as his own second
1780	With one of an ingraft infirmity:
1781	It were an honest action to say
1782	So to the Moor.
1783	
1784	IAGO	                  Not I, for this fair island:
1785	I do love Cassio well; and would do much
1786	To cure him of this evil--But, hark! what noise?
1787	
1788	[Cry within: 'Help! help!']
1789	
1790	[Re-enter CASSIO, driving in RODERIGO]
1791	
1792	CASSIO	You rogue! you rascal!
1793	
1794	MONTANO	What's the matter, lieutenant?
1795	
1796	CASSIO	A knave teach me my duty!
1797	I'll beat the knave into a twiggen bottle.
1798	
1799	RODERIGO	Beat me!
1800	
1801	CASSIO	       Dost thou prate, rogue?
1802	
1803	[Striking RODERIGO]
1804	
1805	MONTANO	Nay, good lieutenant;
1806	
1807	[Staying him]
1808	
1809	I pray you, sir, hold your hand.
1810	
1811	CASSIO	Let me go, sir,
1812	Or I'll knock you o'er the mazzard.
1813	
1814	MONTANO	Come, come,
1815	you're drunk.
1816	
1817	CASSIO	Drunk!
1818	
1819	[They fight]
1820	
1821	IAGO	[Aside to RODERIGO]  Away, I say; go out, and cry a mutiny.
1822	
1823	[Exit RODERIGO]
1824	
1825	Nay, good lieutenant,--alas, gentlemen;--
1826	Help, ho!--Lieutenant,--sir,--Montano,--sir;
1827	Help, masters!--Here's a goodly watch indeed!
1828	
1829	[Bell rings]
1830	
1831	Who's that which rings the bell?--Diablo, ho!
1832	The town will rise: God's will, lieutenant, hold!
1833	You will be shamed for ever.
1834	
1835	[Re-enter OTHELLO and Attendants]
1836	
1837	OTHELLO	What is the matter here?
1838	
1839	MONTANO	'Zounds, I bleed still; I am hurt to the death.
1840	
1841	[Faints]
1842	
1843	OTHELLO	Hold, for your lives!
1844	
1845	IAGO	Hold, ho! Lieutenant,--sir--Montano,--gentlemen,--
1846	Have you forgot all sense of place and duty?
1847	Hold! the general speaks to you; hold, hold, for shame!
1848	
1849	OTHELLO	Why, how now, ho! from whence ariseth this?
1850	Are we turn'd Turks, and to ourselves do that
1851	Which heaven hath forbid the Ottomites?
1852	For Christian shame, put by this barbarous brawl:
1853	He that stirs next to carve for his own rage
1854	Holds his soul light; he dies upon his motion.
1855	Silence that dreadful bell: it frights the isle
1856	From her propriety. What is the matter, masters?
1857	Honest Iago, that look'st dead with grieving,
1858	Speak, who began this? on thy love, I charge thee.
1859	
1860	IAGO	I do not know: friends all but now, even now,
1861	In quarter, and in terms like bride and groom
1862	Devesting them for bed; and then, but now--
1863	As if some planet had unwitted men--
1864	Swords out, and tilting one at other's breast,
1865	In opposition bloody. I cannot speak
1866	Any beginning to this peevish odds;
1867	And would in action glorious I had lost
1868	Those legs that brought me to a part of it!
1869	
1870	OTHELLO	How comes it, Michael, you are thus forgot?
1871	
1872	CASSIO	I pray you, pardon me; I cannot speak.
1873	
1874	OTHELLO	Worthy Montano, you were wont be civil;
1875	The gravity and stillness of your youth
1876	The world hath noted, and your name is great
1877	In mouths of wisest censure: what's the matter,
1878	That you unlace your reputation thus
1879	And spend your rich opinion for the name
1880	Of a night-brawler? give me answer to it.
1881	
1882	MONTANO	Worthy Othello, I am hurt to danger:
1883	Your officer, Iago, can inform you,--
1884	While I spare speech, which something now
1885	offends me,--
1886	Of all that I do know: nor know I aught
1887	By me that's said or done amiss this night;
1888	Unless self-charity be sometimes a vice,
1889	And to defend ourselves it be a sin
1890	When violence assails us.
1891	
1892	OTHELLO	Now, by heaven,
1893	My blood begins my safer guides to rule;
1894	And passion, having my best judgment collied,
1895	Assays to lead the way: if I once stir,
1896	Or do but lift this arm, the best of you
1897	Shall sink in my rebuke. Give me to know
1898	How this foul rout began, who set it on;
1899	And he that is approved in this offence,
1900	Though he had twinn'd with me, both at a birth,
1901	Shall lose me. What! in a town of war,
1902	Yet wild, the people's hearts brimful of fear,
1903	To manage private and domestic quarrel,
1904	In night, and on the court and guard of safety!
1905	'Tis monstrous. Iago, who began't?
1906	
1907	MONTANO	If partially affined, or leagued in office,
1908	Thou dost deliver more or less than truth,
1909	Thou art no soldier.
1910	
1911	IAGO	Touch me not so near:
1912	I had rather have this tongue cut from my mouth
1913	Than it should do offence to Michael Cassio;
1914	Yet, I persuade myself, to speak the truth
1915	Shall nothing wrong him. Thus it is, general.
1916	Montano and myself being in speech,
1917	There comes a fellow crying out for help:
1918	And Cassio following him with determined sword,
1919	To execute upon him. Sir, this gentleman
1920	Steps in to Cassio, and entreats his pause:
1921	Myself the crying fellow did pursue,
1922	Lest by his clamour--as it so fell out--
1923	The town might fall in fright: he, swift of foot,
1924	Outran my purpose; and I return'd the rather
1925	For that I heard the clink and fall of swords,
1926	And Cassio high in oath; which till to-night
1927	I ne'er might say before. When I came back--
1928	For this was brief--I found them close together,
1929	At blow and thrust; even as again they were
1930	When you yourself did part them.
1931	More of this matter cannot I report:
1932	But men are men; the best sometimes forget:
1933	Though Cassio did some little wrong to him,
1934	As men in rage strike those that wish them best,
1935	Yet surely Cassio, I believe, received
1936	From him that fled some strange indignity,
1937	Which patience could not pass.
1938	
1939	OTHELLO	I know, Iago,
1940	Thy honesty and love doth mince this matter,
1941	Making it light to Cassio. Cassio, I love thee
1942	But never more be officer of mine.
1943	
1944	[Re-enter DESDEMONA, attended]
1945	
1946	Look, if my gentle love be not raised up!
1947	I'll make thee an example.
1948	
1949	DESDEMONA	What's the matter?
1950	
1951	OTHELLO	All's well now, sweeting; come away to bed.
1952	Sir, for your hurts, myself will be your surgeon:
1953	Lead him off.
1954	
1955	[To MONTANO, who is led off]
1956	
1957	Iago, look with care about the town,
1958	And silence those whom this vile brawl distracted.
1959	Come, Desdemona: 'tis the soldiers' life
1960	To have their balmy slumbers waked with strife.
1961	
1962	[Exeunt all but IAGO and CASSIO]
1963	
1964	IAGO	What, are you hurt, lieutenant?
1965	
1966	CASSIO	Ay, past all surgery.
1967	
1968	IAGO	Marry, heaven forbid!
1969	
1970	CASSIO	Reputation, reputation, reputation! O, I have lost
1971	my reputation! I have lost the immortal part of
1972	myself, and what remains is bestial. My reputation,
1973	Iago, my reputation!
1974	
1975	IAGO	As I am an honest man, I thought you had received
1976	some bodily wound; there is more sense in that than
1977	in reputation. Reputation is an idle and most false
1978	imposition: oft got without merit, and lost without
1979	deserving: you have lost no reputation at all,
1980	unless you repute yourself such a loser. What, man!
1981	there are ways to recover the general again: you
1982	are but now cast in his mood, a punishment more in
1983	policy than in malice, even so as one would beat his
1984	offenceless dog to affright an imperious lion: sue
1985	to him again, and he's yours.
1986	
1987	CASSIO	I will rather sue to be despised than to deceive so
1988	good a commander with so slight, so drunken, and so
1989	indiscreet an officer. Drunk? and speak parrot?
1990	and squabble? swagger? swear? and discourse
1991	fustian with one's own shadow? O thou invisible
1992	spirit of wine, if thou hast no name to be known by,
1993	let us call thee devil!
1994	
1995	IAGO	What was he that you followed with your sword? What
1996	had he done to you?
1997	
1998	CASSIO	I know not.
1999	
2000	IAGO	Is't possible?
2001	
2002	CASSIO	I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
2003	a quarrel, but nothing wherefore. O God, that men
2004	should put an enemy in their mouths to steal away
2005	their brains! that we should, with joy, pleasance
2006	revel and applause, transform ourselves into beasts!
2007	
2008	IAGO	Why, but you are now well enough: how came you thus
2009	recovered?
2010	
2011	CASSIO	It hath pleased the devil drunkenness to give place
2012	to the devil wrath; one unperfectness shows me
2013	another, to make me frankly despise myself.
2014	
2015	IAGO	Come, you are too severe a moraler: as the time,
2016	the place, and the condition of this country
2017	stands, I could heartily wish this had not befallen;
2018	but, since it is as it is, mend it for your own good.
2019	
2020	CASSIO	I will ask him for my place again; he shall tell me
2021	I am a drunkard! Had I as many mouths as Hydra,
2022	such an answer would stop them all. To be now a
2023	sensible man, by and by a fool, and presently a
2024	beast! O strange! Every inordinate cup is
2025	unblessed and the ingredient is a devil.
2026	
2027	IAGO	Come, come, good wine is a good familiar creature,
2028	if it be well used: exclaim no more against it.
2029	And, good lieutenant, I think you think I love you.
2030	
2031	CASSIO	I have well approved it, sir. I drunk!
2032	
2033	IAGO	You or any man living may be drunk! at a time, man.
2034	I'll tell you what you shall do. Our general's wife
2035	is now the general: may say so in this respect, for
2036	that he hath devoted and given up himself to the
2037	contemplation, mark, and denotement of her parts and
2038	graces: confess yourself freely to her; importune
2039	her help to put you in your place again: she is of
2040	so free, so kind, so apt, so blessed a disposition,
2041	she holds it a vice in her goodness not to do more
2042	than she is requested: this broken joint between
2043	you and her husband entreat her to splinter; and, my
2044	fortunes against any lay worth naming, this
2045	crack of your love shall grow stronger than it was before.
2046	
2047	CASSIO	You advise me well.
2048	
2049	IAGO	I protest, in the sincerity of love and honest kindness.
2050	
2051	CASSIO	I think it freely; and betimes in the morning I will
2052	beseech the virtuous Desdemona to undertake for me:
2053	I am desperate of my fortunes if they cheque me here.
2054	
2055	IAGO	You are in the right. Good night, lieutenant; I
2056	must to the watch.
2057	
2058	CASSIO: Good night, honest Iago.
2059	
2060	[Exit]
2061	
2062	IAGO	And what's he then that says I play the villain?
2063	When this advice is free I give and honest,
2064	Probal to thinking and indeed the course
2065	To win the Moor again? For 'tis most easy
2066	The inclining Desdemona to subdue
2067	In any honest suit: she's framed as fruitful
2068	As the free elements. And then for her
2069	To win the Moor--were't to renounce his baptism,
2070	All seals and symbols of redeemed sin,
2071	His soul is so enfetter'd to her love,
2072	That she may make, unmake, do what she list,
2073	Even as her appetite shall play the god
2074	With his weak function. How am I then a villain
2075	To counsel Cassio to this parallel course,
2076	Directly to his good? Divinity of hell!
2077	When devils will the blackest sins put on,
2078	They do suggest at first with heavenly shows,
2079	As I do now: for whiles this honest fool
2080	Plies Desdemona to repair his fortunes
2081	And she for him pleads strongly to the Moor,
2082	I'll pour this pestilence into his ear,
2083	That she repeals him for her body's lust;
2084	And by how much she strives to do him good,
2085	She shall undo her credit with the Moor.
2086	So will I turn her virtue into pitch,
2087	And out of her own goodness make the net
2088	That shall enmesh them all.
2089	
2090	[Re-enter RODERIGO]
2091	
2092	How now, Roderigo!
2093	
2094	RODERIGO	I do follow here in the chase, not like a hound that
2095	hunts, but one that fills up the cry. My money is
2096	almost spent; I have been to-night exceedingly well
2097	cudgelled; and I think the issue will be, I shall
2098	have so much experience for my pains, and so, with
2099	no money at all and a little more wit, return again to Venice.
2100	
2101	IAGO	How poor are they that have not patience!
2102	What wound did ever heal but by degrees?
2103	Thou know'st we work by wit, and not by witchcraft;
2104	And wit depends on dilatory time.
2105	Does't not go well? Cassio hath beaten thee.
2106	And thou, by that small hurt, hast cashier'd Cassio:
2107	Though other things grow fair against the sun,
2108	Yet fruits that blossom first will first be ripe:
2109	Content thyself awhile. By the mass, 'tis morning;
2110	Pleasure and action make the hours seem short.
2111	Retire thee; go where thou art billeted:
2112	Away, I say; thou shalt know more hereafter:
2113	Nay, get thee gone.
2114	
2115	[Exit RODERIGO]
2116	
2117	Two things are to be done:
2118	My wife must move for Cassio to her mistress;
2119	I'll set her on;
2120	Myself the while to draw the Moor apart,
2121	And bring him jump when he may Cassio find
2122	Soliciting his wife: ay, that's the way
2123	Dull not device by coldness and delay.

2135	
2136	
2137	SCENE I	Before the castle.
2138	
2139	
2140	[Enter CASSIO and some Musicians]
2141	
2142	CASSIO	Masters, play here; I will content your pains;
2143	Something that's brief; and bid 'Good morrow, general.'
2144	
2145	[Music]
2146	
2147	[Enter Clown]
2148	
2149	Clown	Why masters, have your instruments been in Naples,
2150	that they speak i' the nose thus?
2151	
2152	First Musician	How, sir, how!
2153	
2154	Clown	Are these, I pray you, wind-instruments?
2155	
2156	First Musician	Ay, marry, are they, sir.
2157	
2158	Clown	O, thereby hangs a tail.
2159	
2160	First Musician	Whereby hangs a tale, sir?
2161	
2162	Clown	Marry. sir, by many a wind-instrument that I know.
2163	But, masters, here's money for you: and the general
2164	so likes your music, that he desires you, for love's
2165	sake, to make no more noise with it.
2166	
2167	First Musician	Well, sir, we will not.
2168	
2169	Clown	If you have any music that may not be heard, to't
2170	again: but, as they say to hear music the general
2171	does not greatly care.
2172	
2173	First Musician	We have none such, sir.
2174	
2175	Clown	Then put up your pipes in your bag, for I'll away:
2176	go; vanish into air; away!
2177	
2178	[Exeunt Musicians]
2179	
2180	CASSIO	Dost thou hear, my honest friend?
2181	
2182	Clown	No, I hear not your honest friend; I hear you.
2183	
2184	CASSIO	Prithee, keep up thy quillets. There's a poor piece
2185	of gold for thee: if the gentlewoman that attends
2186	the general's wife be stirring, tell her there's
2187	one Cassio entreats her a little favour of speech:
2188	wilt thou do this?
2189	
2190	Clown	She is stirring, sir: if she will stir hither, I
2191	shall seem to notify unto her.
2192	
2193	CASSIO	Do, good my friend.
2194	
2195	[Exit Clown]
2196	
2197	[Enter IAGO]
2198	
2199	In happy time, Iago.
2200	
2201	IAGO	You have not been a-bed, then?
2202	
2203	CASSIO	Why, no; the day had broke
2204	Before we parted. I have made bold, Iago,
2205	To send in to your wife: my suit to her
2206	Is, that she will to virtuous Desdemona
2207	Procure me some access.
2208	
2209	IAGO	I'll send her to you presently;
2210	And I'll devise a mean to draw the Moor
2211	Out of the way, that your converse and business
2212	May be more free.
2213	
2214	CASSIO	I humbly thank you for't.
2215	
2216	[Exit IAGO]
2217	
2218	I never knew
2219	A Florentine more kind and honest.
2220	
2221	[Enter EMILIA]
2222	
2223	EMILIA	Good morrow, good Lieutenant: I am sorry
2224	For your displeasure; but all will sure be well.
2225	The general and his wife are talking of it;
2226	And she speaks for you stoutly: the Moor replies,
2227	That he you hurt is of great fame in Cyprus,
2228	And great affinity, and that in wholesome wisdom
2229	He might not but refuse you; but he protests he loves you
2230	And needs no other suitor but his likings
2231	To take the safest occasion by the front
2232	To bring you in again.
2233	
2234	CASSIO	Yet, I beseech you,
2235	If you think fit, or that it may be done,
2236	Give me advantage of some brief discourse
2237	With Desdemona alone.
2238	
2239	EMILIA	Pray you, come in;
2240	I will bestow you where you shall have time
2241	To speak your bosom freely.
2242	
2243	CASSIO	I am much bound to you.
2244	
2245	[Exeunt]

2257	SCENE II	A room in the castle.
2258	
2259	
2260	[Enter OTHELLO, IAGO, and Gentlemen]
2261	
2262	OTHELLO	These letters give, Iago, to the pilot;
2263	And by him do my duties to the senate:
2264	That done, I will be walking on the works;
2265	Repair there to me.
2266	
2267	IAGO	Well, my good lord, I'll do't.
2268	
2269	OTHELLO	This fortification, gentlemen, shall we see't?
2270	
2271	Gentleman	We'll wait upon your lordship.
2272

2284	
2285	SCENE III	The garden of the castle.
2286	
2287	
2288	[Enter DESDEMONA, CASSIO, and EMILIA]
2289	
2290	DESDEMONA	Be thou assured, good Cassio, I will do
2291	All my abilities in thy behalf.
2292	
2293	EMILIA	Good madam, do: I warrant it grieves my husband,
2294	As if the case were his.
2295	
2296	DESDEMONA	O, that's an honest fellow. Do not doubt, Cassio,
2297	But I will have my lord and you again
2298	As friendly as you were.
2299	
2300	CASSIO	Bounteous madam,
2301	Whatever shall become of Michael Cassio,
2302	He's never any thing but your true servant.
2303	
2304	DESDEMONA	I know't; I thank you. You do love my lord:
2305	You have known him long; and be you well assured
2306	He shall in strangeness stand no further off
2307	Than in a polite distance.
2308	
2309	CASSIO	Ay, but, lady,
2310	That policy may either last so long,
2311	Or feed upon such nice and waterish diet,
2312	Or breed itself so out of circumstance,
2313	That, I being absent and my place supplied,
2314	My general will forget my love and service.
2315	
2316	DESDEMONA	Do not doubt that; before Emilia here
2317	I give thee warrant of thy place: assure thee,
2318	If I do vow a friendship, I'll perform it
2319	To the last article: my lord shall never rest;
2320	I'll watch him tame and talk him out of patience;
2321	His bed shall seem a school, his board a shrift;
2322	I'll intermingle every thing he does
2323	With Cassio's suit: therefore be merry, Cassio;
2324	For thy solicitor shall rather die
2325	Than give thy cause away.
2326	
2327	EMILIA	Madam, here comes my lord.
2328	
2329	CASSIO	Madam, I'll take my leave.
2330	
2331	DESDEMONA	Why, stay, and hear me speak.
2332	
2333	CASSIO	Madam, not now: I am very ill at ease,
2334	Unfit for mine own purposes.
2335	
2336	DESDEMONA	Well, do your discretion.
2337	
2338	[Exit CASSIO]
2339	
2340	[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]
2341	
2342	IAGO	Ha! I like not that.
2343	
2344	OTHELLO	What dost thou say?
2345	
2346	IAGO	Nothing, my lord: or if--I know not what.
2347	
2348	OTHELLO	Was not that Cassio parted from my wife?
2349	
2350	IAGO	Cassio, my lord! No, sure, I cannot think it,
2351	That he would steal away so guilty-like,
2352	Seeing you coming.
2353	
2354	OTHELLO	                  I do believe 'twas he.
2355	
2356	DESDEMONA	How now, my lord!
2357	I have been talking with a suitor here,
2358	A man that languishes in your displeasure.
2359	
2360	OTHELLO	Who is't you mean?
2361	
2362	DESDEMONA	Why, your lieutenant, Cassio. Good my lord,
2363	If I have any grace or power to move you,
2364	His present reconciliation take;
2365	For if he be not one that truly loves you,
2366	That errs in ignorance and not in cunning,
2367	I have no judgment in an honest face:
2368	I prithee, call him back.
2369	
2370	OTHELLO	Went he hence now?
2371	
2372	DESDEMONA	Ay, sooth; so humbled
2373	That he hath left part of his grief with me,
2374	To suffer with him. Good love, call him back.
2375	
2376	OTHELLO	Not now, sweet Desdemona; some other time.
2377	
2378	DESDEMONA	But shall't be shortly?
2379	
2380	OTHELLO	The sooner, sweet, for you.
2381	
2382	DESDEMONA	Shall't be to-night at supper?
2383	
2384	OTHELLO	No, not to-night.
2385	
2386	DESDEMONA	To-morrow dinner, then?
2387	
2388	OTHELLO	I shall not dine at home;
2389	I meet the captains at the citadel.
2390	
2391	DESDEMONA	Why, then, to-morrow night; or Tuesday morn;
2392	On Tuesday noon, or night; on Wednesday morn:
2393	I prithee, name the time, but let it not
2394	Exceed three days: in faith, he's penitent;
2395	And yet his trespass, in our common reason--
2396	Save that, they say, the wars must make examples
2397	Out of their best--is not almost a fault
2398	To incur a private cheque. When shall he come?
2399	Tell me, Othello: I wonder in my soul,
2400	What you would ask me, that I should deny,
2401	Or stand so mammering on. What! Michael Cassio,
2402	That came a-wooing with you, and so many a time,
2403	When I have spoke of you dispraisingly,
2404	Hath ta'en your part; to have so much to do
2405	To bring him in! Trust me, I could do much,--
2406	
2407	OTHELLO	Prithee, no more: let him come when he will;
2408	I will deny thee nothing.
2409	
2410	DESDEMONA	Why, this is not a boon;
2411	'Tis as I should entreat you wear your gloves,
2412	Or feed on nourishing dishes, or keep you warm,
2413	Or sue to you to do a peculiar profit
2414	To your own person: nay, when I have a suit
2415	Wherein I mean to touch your love indeed,
2416	It shall be full of poise and difficult weight
2417	And fearful to be granted.
2418	
2419	OTHELLO	I will deny thee nothing:
2420	Whereon, I do beseech thee, grant me this,
2421	To leave me but a little to myself.
2422	
2423	DESDEMONA	Shall I deny you? no: farewell, my lord.
2424	
2425	OTHELLO	Farewell, my Desdemona: I'll come to thee straight.
2426	
2427	DESDEMONA	Emilia, come. Be as your fancies teach you;
2428	Whate'er you be, I am obedient.
2429	
2430	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
2431	
2432	OTHELLO	Excellent wretch! Perdition catch my soul,
2433	But I do love thee! and when I love thee not,
2434	Chaos is come again.
2435	
2436	IAGO	My noble lord--
2437	
2438	OTHELLO	                  What dost thou say, Iago?
2439	
2440	IAGO	Did Michael Cassio, when you woo'd my lady,
2441	Know of your love?
2442	
2443	OTHELLO	He did, from first to last: why dost thou ask?
2444	
2445	IAGO	But for a satisfaction of my thought;
2446	No further harm.
2447	
2448	OTHELLO	                  Why of thy thought, Iago?
2449	
2450	IAGO	I did not think he had been acquainted with her.
2451	
2452	OTHELLO	O, yes; and went between us very oft.
2453	
2454	IAGO	Indeed!
2455	
2456	OTHELLO	Indeed! ay, indeed: discern'st thou aught in that?
2457	Is he not honest?
2458	
2459	IAGO	Honest, my lord!
2460	
2461	OTHELLO	                  Honest! ay, honest.
2462	
2463	IAGO	My lord, for aught I know.
2464	
2465	OTHELLO	What dost thou think?
2466	
2467	IAGO	Think, my lord!
2468	
2469	OTHELLO	Think, my lord!
2470	By heaven, he echoes me,
2471	As if there were some monster in his thought
2472	Too hideous to be shown. Thou dost mean something:
2473	I heard thee say even now, thou likedst not that,
2474	When Cassio left my wife: what didst not like?
2475	And when I told thee he was of my counsel
2476	In my whole course of wooing, thou criedst 'Indeed!'
2477	And didst contract and purse thy brow together,
2478	As if thou then hadst shut up in thy brain
2479	Some horrible conceit: if thou dost love me,
2480	Show me thy thought.
2481	
2482	IAGO	My lord, you know I love you.
2483	
2484	OTHELLO	I think thou dost;
2485	And, for I know thou'rt full of love and honesty,
2486	And weigh'st thy words before thou givest them breath,
2487	Therefore these stops of thine fright me the more:
2488	For such things in a false disloyal knave
2489	Are tricks of custom, but in a man that's just
2490	They are close delations, working from the heart
2491	That passion cannot rule.
2492	
2493	IAGO	For Michael Cassio,
2494	I dare be sworn I think that he is honest.
2495	
2496	OTHELLO	I think so too.
2497	
2498	IAGO	                  Men should be what they seem;
2499	Or those that be not, would they might seem none!
2500	
2501	OTHELLO	Certain, men should be what they seem.
2502	
2503	IAGO	Why, then, I think Cassio's an honest man.
2504	
2505	OTHELLO	Nay, yet there's more in this:
2506	I prithee, speak to me as to thy thinkings,
2507	As thou dost ruminate, and give thy worst of thoughts
2508	The worst of words.
2509	
2510	IAGO	Good my lord, pardon me:
2511	Though I am bound to every act of duty,
2512	I am not bound to that all slaves are free to.
2513	Utter my thoughts? Why, say they are vile and false;
2514	As where's that palace whereinto foul things
2515	Sometimes intrude not? who has a breast so pure,
2516	But some uncleanly apprehensions
2517	Keep leets and law-days and in session sit
2518	With meditations lawful?
2519	
2520	OTHELLO	Thou dost conspire against thy friend, Iago,
2521	If thou but think'st him wrong'd and makest his ear
2522	A stranger to thy thoughts.
2523	
2524	IAGO	I do beseech you--
2525	Though I perchance am vicious in my guess,
2526	As, I confess, it is my nature's plague
2527	To spy into abuses, and oft my jealousy
2528	Shapes faults that are not--that your wisdom yet,
2529	From one that so imperfectly conceits,
2530	Would take no notice, nor build yourself a trouble
2531	Out of his scattering and unsure observance.
2532	It were not for your quiet nor your good,
2533	Nor for my manhood, honesty, or wisdom,
2534	To let you know my thoughts.
2535	
2536	OTHELLO	What dost thou mean?
2537	
2538	IAGO	Good name in man and woman, dear my lord,
2539	Is the immediate jewel of their souls:
2540	Who steals my purse steals trash; 'tis something, nothing;
2541	'Twas mine, 'tis his, and has been slave to thousands:
2542	But he that filches from me my good name
2543	Robs me of that which not enriches him
2544	And makes me poor indeed.
2545	
2546	OTHELLO	By heaven, I'll know thy thoughts.
2547	
2548	IAGO	You cannot, if my heart were in your hand;
2549	Nor shall not, whilst 'tis in my custody.
2550	
2551	OTHELLO	Ha!
2552	
2553	IAGO	O, beware, my lord, of jealousy;
2554	It is the green-eyed monster which doth mock
2555	The meat it feeds on; that cuckold lives in bliss
2556	Who, certain of his fate, loves not his wronger;
2557	But, O, what damned minutes tells he o'er
2558	Who dotes, yet doubts, suspects, yet strongly loves!
2559	
2560	OTHELLO	O misery!
2561	
2562	IAGO	Poor and content is rich and rich enough,
2563	But riches fineless is as poor as winter
2564	To him that ever fears he shall be poor.
2565	Good heaven, the souls of all my tribe defend
2566	From jealousy!
2567	
2568	OTHELLO	                  Why, why is this?
2569	Think'st thou I'ld make a lie of jealousy,
2570	To follow still the changes of the moon
2571	With fresh suspicions? No; to be once in doubt
2572	Is once to be resolved: exchange me for a goat,
2573	When I shall turn the business of my soul
2574	To such exsufflicate and blown surmises,
2575	Matching thy inference. 'Tis not to make me jealous
2576	To say my wife is fair, feeds well, loves company,
2577	Is free of speech, sings, plays and dances well;
2578	Where virtue is, these are more virtuous:
2579	Nor from mine own weak merits will I draw
2580	The smallest fear or doubt of her revolt;
2581	For she had eyes, and chose me. No, Iago;
2582	I'll see before I doubt; when I doubt, prove;
2583	And on the proof, there is no more but this,--
2584	Away at once with love or jealousy!
2585	
2586	IAGO	I am glad of it; for now I shall have reason
2587	To show the love and duty that I bear you
2588	With franker spirit: therefore, as I am bound,
2589	Receive it from me. I speak not yet of proof.
2590	Look to your wife; observe her well with Cassio;
2591	Wear your eye thus, not jealous nor secure:
2592	I would not have your free and noble nature,
2593	Out of self-bounty, be abused; look to't:
2594	I know our country disposition well;
2595	In Venice they do let heaven see the pranks
2596	They dare not show their husbands; their best conscience
2597	Is not to leave't undone, but keep't unknown.
2598	
2599	OTHELLO	Dost thou say so?
2600	
2601	IAGO	She did deceive her father, marrying you;
2602	And when she seem'd to shake and fear your looks,
2603	She loved them most.
2604	
2605	OTHELLO	And so she did.
2606	
2607	IAGO	Why, go to then;
2608	She that, so young, could give out such a seeming,
2609	To seal her father's eyes up close as oak-
2610	He thought 'twas witchcraft--but I am much to blame;
2611	I humbly do beseech you of your pardon
2612	For too much loving you.
2613	
2614	OTHELLO	I am bound to thee for ever.
2615	
2616	IAGO	I see this hath a little dash'd your spirits.
2617	
2618	OTHELLO	Not a jot, not a jot.
2619	
2620	IAGO	I' faith, I fear it has.
2621	I hope you will consider what is spoke
2622	Comes from my love. But I do see you're moved:
2623	I am to pray you not to strain my speech
2624	To grosser issues nor to larger reach
2625	Than to suspicion.
2626	
2627	OTHELLO	I will not.
2628	
2629	IAGO	          Should you do so, my lord,
2630	My speech should fall into such vile success
2631	As my thoughts aim not at. Cassio's my worthy friend--
2632	My lord, I see you're moved.
2633	
2634	OTHELLO	No, not much moved:
2635	I do not think but Desdemona's honest.
2636	
2637	IAGO	Long live she so! and long live you to think so!
2638	
2639	OTHELLO	And yet, how nature erring from itself,--
2640	
2641	IAGO	Ay, there's the point: as--to be bold with you--
2642	Not to affect many proposed matches
2643	Of her own clime, complexion, and degree,
2644	Whereto we see in all things nature tends--
2645	Foh! one may smell in such a will most rank,
2646	Foul disproportion thoughts unnatural.
2647	But pardon me; I do not in position
2648	Distinctly speak of her; though I may fear
2649	Her will, recoiling to her better judgment,
2650	May fall to match you with her country forms
2651	And happily repent.
2652	
2653	OTHELLO	Farewell, farewell:
2654	If more thou dost perceive, let me know more;
2655	Set on thy wife to observe: leave me, Iago:
2656	
2657	IAGO	[Going]  My lord, I take my leave.
2658	
2659	OTHELLO	Why did I marry? This honest creature doubtless
2660	Sees and knows more, much more, than he unfolds.
2661	
2662	IAGO	[Returning]  My lord, I would I might entreat
2663	your honour
2664	To scan this thing no further; leave it to time:
2665	Though it be fit that Cassio have his place,
2666	For sure, he fills it up with great ability,
2667	Yet, if you please to hold him off awhile,
2668	You shall by that perceive him and his means:
2669	Note, if your lady strain his entertainment
2670	With any strong or vehement importunity;
2671	Much will be seen in that. In the mean time,
2672	Let me be thought too busy in my fears--
2673	As worthy cause I have to fear I am--
2674	And hold her free, I do beseech your honour.
2675	
2676	OTHELLO	Fear not my government.
2677	
2678	IAGO	I once more take my leave.
2679	
2680	[Exit]
2681	
2682	OTHELLO	This fellow's of exceeding honesty,
2683	And knows all qualities, with a learned spirit,
2684	Of human dealings. If I do prove her haggard,
2685	Though that her jesses were my dear heartstrings,
2686	I'ld whistle her off and let her down the wind,
2687	To pray at fortune. Haply, for I am black
2688	And have not those soft parts of conversation
2689	That chamberers have, or for I am declined
2690	Into the vale of years,--yet that's not much--
2691	She's gone. I am abused; and my relief
2692	Must be to loathe her. O curse of marriage,
2693	That we can call these delicate creatures ours,
2694	And not their appetites! I had rather be a toad,
2695	And live upon the vapour of a dungeon,
2696	Than keep a corner in the thing I love
2697	For others' uses. Yet, 'tis the plague of great ones;
2698	Prerogatived are they less than the base;
2699	'Tis destiny unshunnable, like death:
2700	Even then this forked plague is fated to us
2701	When we do quicken. Desdemona comes:
2702	
2703	[Re-enter DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
2704	
2705	If she be false, O, then heaven mocks itself!
2706	I'll not believe't.
2707	
2708	DESDEMONA	How now, my dear Othello!
2709	Your dinner, and the generous islanders
2710	By you invited, do attend your presence.
2711	
2712	OTHELLO	I am to blame.
2713	
2714	DESDEMONA	                  Why do you speak so faintly?
2715	Are you not well?
2716	
2717	OTHELLO	I have a pain upon my forehead here.
2718	
2719	DESDEMONA	'Faith, that's with watching; 'twill away again:
2720	Let me but bind it hard, within this hour
2721	It will be well.
2722	
2723	OTHELLO	                  Your napkin is too little:
2724	
2725	[He puts the handkerchief from him; and it drops]
2726	
2727	Let it alone. Come, I'll go in with you.
2728	
2729	DESDEMONA	I am very sorry that you are not well.
2730	
2731	[Exeunt OTHELLO and DESDEMONA]
2732	
2733	EMILIA	I am glad I have found this napkin:
2734	This was her first remembrance from the Moor:
2735	My wayward husband hath a hundred times
2736	Woo'd me to steal it; but she so loves the token,
2737	For he conjured her she should ever keep it,
2738	That she reserves it evermore about her
2739	To kiss and talk to. I'll have the work ta'en out,
2740	And give't Iago: what he will do with it
2741	Heaven knows, not I;
2742	I nothing but to please his fantasy.
2743	
2744	[Re-enter Iago]
2745	
2746	IAGO	How now! what do you here alone?
2747	
2748	EMILIA	Do not you chide; I have a thing for you.
2749	
2750	IAGO	A thing for me? it is a common thing--
2751	
2752	EMILIA	Ha!
2753	
2754	IAGO	To have a foolish wife.
2755	
2756	EMILIA	O, is that all? What will you give me now
2757	For the same handkerchief?
2758	
2759	IAGO	What handkerchief?
2760	
2761	EMILIA	What handkerchief?
2762	Why, that the Moor first gave to Desdemona;
2763	That which so often you did bid me steal.
2764	
2765	IAGO	Hast stol'n it from her?
2766	
2767	EMILIA	No, 'faith; she let it drop by negligence.
2768	And, to the advantage, I, being here, took't up.
2769	Look, here it is.
2770	
2771	IAGO	                  A good wench; give it me.
2772	
2773	EMILIA	What will you do with 't, that you have been
2774	so earnest
2775	To have me filch it?
2776	
2777	IAGO	[Snatching it]  Why, what's that to you?
2778	
2779	EMILIA	If it be not for some purpose of import,
2780	Give't me again: poor lady, she'll run mad
2781	When she shall lack it.
2782	
2783	IAGO	Be not acknown on 't; I have use for it.
2784	Go, leave me.
2785	
2786	[Exit EMILIA]
2787	
2788	I will in Cassio's lodging lose this napkin,
2789	And let him find it. Trifles light as air
2790	Are to the jealous confirmations strong
2791	As proofs of holy writ: this may do something.
2792	The Moor already changes with my poison:
2793	Dangerous conceits are, in their natures, poisons.
2794	Which at the first are scarce found to distaste,
2795	But with a little act upon the blood.
2796	Burn like the mines of Sulphur. I did say so:
2797	Look, where he comes!
2798	
2799	[Re-enter OTHELLO]
2800	
2801	Not poppy, nor mandragora,
2802	Nor all the drowsy syrups of the world,
2803	Shall ever medicine thee to that sweet sleep
2804	Which thou owedst yesterday.
2805	
2806	OTHELLO	Ha! ha! false to me?
2807	
2808	IAGO	Why, how now, general! no more of that.
2809	
2810	OTHELLO	Avaunt! be gone! thou hast set me on the rack:
2811	I swear 'tis better to be much abused
2812	Than but to know't a little.
2813	
2814	IAGO	How now, my lord!
2815	
2816	OTHELLO	What sense had I of her stol'n hours of lust?
2817	I saw't not, thought it not, it harm'd not me:
2818	I slept the next night well, was free and merry;
2819	I found not Cassio's kisses on her lips:
2820	He that is robb'd, not wanting what is stol'n,
2821	Let him not know't, and he's not robb'd at all.
2822	
2823	IAGO	I am sorry to hear this.
2824	
2825	OTHELLO	I had been happy, if the general camp,
2826	Pioners and all, had tasted her sweet body,
2827	So I had nothing known. O, now, for ever
2828	Farewell the tranquil mind! farewell content!
2829	Farewell the plumed troop, and the big wars,
2830	That make ambition virtue! O, farewell!
2831	Farewell the neighing steed, and the shrill trump,
2832	The spirit-stirring drum, the ear-piercing fife,
2833	The royal banner, and all quality,
2834	Pride, pomp and circumstance of glorious war!
2835	And, O you mortal engines, whose rude throats
2836	The immortal Jove's dead clamours counterfeit,
2837	Farewell! Othello's occupation's gone!
2838	
2839	IAGO	Is't possible, my lord?
2840	
2841	OTHELLO	Villain, be sure thou prove my love a whore,
2842	Be sure of it; give me the ocular proof:
2843	Or by the worth of man's eternal soul,
2844	Thou hadst been better have been born a dog
2845	Than answer my waked wrath!
2846	
2847	IAGO	Is't come to this?
2848	
2849	OTHELLO	Make me to see't; or, at the least, so prove it,
2850	That the probation bear no hinge nor loop
2851	To hang a doubt on; or woe upon thy life!
2852	
2853	IAGO	My noble lord,--
2854	
2855	OTHELLO	If thou dost slander her and torture me,
2856	Never pray more; abandon all remorse;
2857	On horror's head horrors accumulate;
2858	Do deeds to make heaven weep, all earth amazed;
2859	For nothing canst thou to damnation add
2860	Greater than that.
2861	
2862	IAGO	                  O grace! O heaven forgive me!
2863	Are you a man? have you a soul or sense?
2864	God be wi' you; take mine office. O wretched fool.
2865	That livest to make thine honesty a vice!
2866	O monstrous world! Take note, take note, O world,
2867	To be direct and honest is not safe.
2868	I thank you for this profit; and from hence
2869	I'll love no friend, sith love breeds such offence.
2870	
2871	OTHELLO	Nay, stay: thou shouldst be honest.
2872	
2873	IAGO	I should be wise, for honesty's a fool
2874	And loses that it works for.
2875	
2876	OTHELLO	By the world,
2877	I think my wife be honest and think she is not;
2878	I think that thou art just and think thou art not.
2879	I'll have some proof. Her name, that was as fresh
2880	As Dian's visage, is now begrimed and black
2881	As mine own face. If there be cords, or knives,
2882	Poison, or fire, or suffocating streams,
2883	I'll not endure it. Would I were satisfied!
2884	
2885	IAGO	I see, sir, you are eaten up with passion:
2886	I do repent me that I put it to you.
2887	You would be satisfied?
2888	
2889	OTHELLO	Would! nay, I will.
2890	
2891	IAGO	And may: but, how? how satisfied, my lord?
2892	Would you, the supervisor, grossly gape on--
2893	Behold her topp'd?
2894	
2895	OTHELLO	                  Death and damnation! O!
2896	
2897	IAGO	It were a tedious difficulty, I think,
2898	To bring them to that prospect: damn them then,
2899	If ever mortal eyes do see them bolster
2900	More than their own! What then? how then?
2901	What shall I say? Where's satisfaction?
2902	It is impossible you should see this,
2903	Were they as prime as goats, as hot as monkeys,
2904	As salt as wolves in pride, and fools as gross
2905	As ignorance made drunk. But yet, I say,
2906	If imputation and strong circumstances,
2907	Which lead directly to the door of truth,
2908	Will give you satisfaction, you may have't.
2909	
2910	OTHELLO	Give me a living reason she's disloyal.
2911	
2912	IAGO	I do not like the office:
2913	But, sith I am enter'd in this cause so far,
2914	Prick'd to't by foolish honesty and love,
2915	I will go on. I lay with Cassio lately;
2916	And, being troubled with a raging tooth,
2917	I could not sleep.
2918	There are a kind of men so loose of soul,
2919	That in their sleeps will mutter their affairs:
2920	One of this kind is Cassio:
2921	In sleep I heard him say 'Sweet Desdemona,
2922	Let us be wary, let us hide our loves;'
2923	And then, sir, would he gripe and wring my hand,
2924	Cry 'O sweet creature!' and then kiss me hard,
2925	As if he pluck'd up kisses by the roots
2926	That grew upon my lips: then laid his leg
2927	Over my thigh, and sigh'd, and kiss'd; and then
2928	Cried 'Cursed fate that gave thee to the Moor!'
2929	
2930	OTHELLO	O monstrous! monstrous!
2931	
2932	IAGO	Nay, this was but his dream.
2933	
2934	OTHELLO	But this denoted a foregone conclusion:
2935	'Tis a shrewd doubt, though it be but a dream.
2936	
2937	IAGO	And this may help to thicken other proofs
2938	That do demonstrate thinly.
2939	
2940	OTHELLO	I'll tear her all to pieces.
2941	
2942	IAGO	Nay, but be wise: yet we see nothing done;
2943	She may be honest yet. Tell me but this,
2944	Have you not sometimes seen a handkerchief
2945	Spotted with strawberries in your wife's hand?
2946	
2947	OTHELLO	I gave her such a one; 'twas my first gift.
2948	
2949	IAGO	I know not that; but such a handkerchief--
2950	I am sure it was your wife's--did I to-day
2951	See Cassio wipe his beard with.
2952	
2953	OTHELLO	If it be that--
2954	
2955	IAGO	If it be that, or any that was hers,
2956	It speaks against her with the other proofs.
2957	
2958	OTHELLO	O, that the slave had forty thousand lives!
2959	One is too poor, too weak for my revenge.
2960	Now do I see 'tis true. Look here, Iago;
2961	All my fond love thus do I blow to heaven.
2962	'Tis gone.
2963	Arise, black vengeance, from thy hollow cell!
2964	Yield up, O love, thy crown and hearted throne
2965	To tyrannous hate! Swell, bosom, with thy fraught,
2966	For 'tis of aspics' tongues!
2967	
2968	IAGO	Yet be content.
2969	
2970	OTHELLO	O, blood, blood, blood!
2971	
2972	IAGO	Patience, I say; your mind perhaps may change.
2973	
2974	OTHELLO	Never, Iago: Like to the Pontic sea,
2975	Whose icy current and compulsive course
2976	Ne'er feels retiring ebb, but keeps due on
2977	To the Propontic and the Hellespont,
2978	Even so my bloody thoughts, with violent pace,
2979	Shall ne'er look back, ne'er ebb to humble love,
2980	Till that a capable and wide revenge
2981	Swallow them up. Now, by yond marble heaven,
2982	
2983	[Kneels]
2984	
2985	In the due reverence of a sacred vow
2986	I here engage my words.
2987	
2988	IAGO	Do not rise yet.
2989	
2990	[Kneels]
2991	
2992	Witness, you ever-burning lights above,
2993	You elements that clip us round about,
2994	Witness that here Iago doth give up
2995	The execution of his wit, hands, heart,
2996	To wrong'd Othello's service! Let him command,
2997	And to obey shall be in me remorse,
2998	What bloody business ever.
2999	
3000	[They rise]
3001	
3002	OTHELLO	I greet thy love,
3003	Not with vain thanks, but with acceptance bounteous,
3004	And will upon the instant put thee to't:
3005	Within these three days let me hear thee say
3006	That Cassio's not alive.
3007	
3008	IAGO	My friend is dead; 'tis done at your request:
3009	But let her live.
3010	
3011	OTHELLO	Damn her, lewd minx! O, damn her!
3012	Come, go with me apart; I will withdraw,
3013	To furnish me with some swift means of death
3014	For the fair devil. Now art thou my lieutenant.
3015	
3016	IAGO	I am your own for ever.
3017	
3018	[Exeunt]
3019	
3020	
3021	
3022	OTHELLO
3023	
3024	
3025	ACT III
3026	
3027	
3028	
3029	SCENE IV	Before the castle.
3030	
3031	
3032	[Enter DESDEMONA, EMILIA, and Clown]
3033	
3034	DESDEMONA	Do you know, sirrah, where Lieutenant Cassio lies?
3035	
3036	Clown	I dare not say he lies any where.
3037	
3038	DESDEMONA	Why, man?
3039	
3040	Clown	He's a soldier, and for one to say a soldier lies,
3041	is stabbing.
3042	
3043	DESDEMONA	Go to: where lodges he?
3044	
3045	Clown	To tell you where he lodges, is to tell you where I lie.
3046	
3047	DESDEMONA	Can any thing be made of this?
3048	
3049	Clown	I know not where he lodges, and for me to devise a
3050	lodging and say he lies here or he lies there, were
3051	to lie in mine own throat.
3052	
3053	DESDEMONA	Can you inquire him out, and be edified by report?
3054	
3055	Clown	I will catechise the world for him; that is, make
3056	questions, and by them answer.
3057	
3058	DESDEMONA	Seek him, bid him come hither: tell him I have
3059	moved my lord on his behalf, and hope all will be well.
3060	
3061	Clown	To do this is within the compass of man's wit: and
3062	therefore I will attempt the doing it.
3063	
3064	[Exit]
3065	
3066	DESDEMONA	Where should I lose that handkerchief, Emilia?
3067	
3068	EMILIA	I know not, madam.
3069	
3070	DESDEMONA	Believe me, I had rather have lost my purse
3071	Full of crusadoes: and, but my noble Moor
3072	Is true of mind and made of no such baseness
3073	As jealous creatures are, it were enough
3074	To put him to ill thinking.
3075	
3076	EMILIA	Is he not jealous?
3077	
3078	DESDEMONA	Who, he? I think the sun where he was born
3079	Drew all such humours from him.
3080	
3081	EMILIA	Look, where he comes.
3082	
3083	DESDEMONA	I will not leave him now till Cassio
3084	Be call'd to him.
3085	
3086	[Enter OTHELLO]
3087	
3088	How is't with you, my lord
3089	
3090	OTHELLO	Well, my good lady.
3091	
3092	[Aside]
3093	
3094	O, hardness to dissemble!--
3095	How do you, Desdemona?
3096	
3097	DESDEMONA	Well, my good lord.
3098	
3099	OTHELLO	Give me your hand: this hand is moist, my lady.
3100	
3101	DESDEMONA	It yet hath felt no age nor known no sorrow.
3102	
3103	OTHELLO	This argues fruitfulness and liberal heart:
3104	Hot, hot, and moist: this hand of yours requires
3105	A sequester from liberty, fasting and prayer,
3106	Much castigation, exercise devout;
3107	For here's a young and sweating devil here,
3108	That commonly rebels. 'Tis a good hand,
3109	A frank one.
3110	
3111	DESDEMONA	                  You may, indeed, say so;
3112	For 'twas that hand that gave away my heart.
3113	
3114	OTHELLO	A liberal hand: the hearts of old gave hands;
3115	But our new heraldry is hands, not hearts.
3116	
3117	DESDEMONA	I cannot speak of this. Come now, your promise.
3118	
3119	OTHELLO	What promise, chuck?
3120	
3121	DESDEMONA	I have sent to bid Cassio come speak with you.
3122	
3123	OTHELLO	I have a salt and sorry rheum offends me;
3124	Lend me thy handkerchief.
3125	
3126	DESDEMONA	Here, my lord.
3127	
3128	OTHELLO	That which I gave you.
3129	
3130	DESDEMONA	I have it not about me.
3131	
3132	OTHELLO	Not?
3133	
3134	DESDEMONA	   No, indeed, my lord.
3135	
3136	OTHELLO	That is a fault.
3137	
3138	That handkerchief
3139	Did an Egyptian to my mother give;
3140	She was a charmer, and could almost read
3141	The thoughts of people: she told her, while
3142	she kept it,
3143	'Twould make her amiable and subdue my father
3144	Entirely to her love, but if she lost it
3145	Or made gift of it, my father's eye
3146	Should hold her loathed and his spirits should hunt
3147	After new fancies: she, dying, gave it me;
3148	And bid me, when my fate would have me wive,
3149	To give it her. I did so: and take heed on't;
3150	Make it a darling like your precious eye;
3151	To lose't or give't away were such perdition
3152	As nothing else could match.
3153	
3154	DESDEMONA	Is't possible?
3155	
3156	OTHELLO	'Tis true: there's magic in the web of it:
3157	A sibyl, that had number'd in the world
3158	The sun to course two hundred compasses,
3159	In her prophetic fury sew'd the work;
3160	The worms were hallow'd that did breed the silk;
3161	And it was dyed in mummy which the skilful
3162	Conserved of maidens' hearts.
3163	
3164	DESDEMONA	Indeed! is't true?
3165	
3166	OTHELLO	Most veritable; therefore look to't well.
3167	
3168	DESDEMONA	Then would to God that I had never seen't!
3169	
3170	OTHELLO	Ha! wherefore?
3171	
3172	DESDEMONA	Why do you speak so startingly and rash?
3173	
3174	OTHELLO	Is't lost? is't gone? speak, is it out
3175	o' the way?
3176	
3177	DESDEMONA	Heaven bless us!
3178	
3179	OTHELLO	Say you?
3180	
3181	DESDEMONA	It is not lost; but what an if it were?
3182	
3183	OTHELLO	How!
3184	
3185	DESDEMONA	I say, it is not lost.
3186	
3187	OTHELLO	Fetch't, let me see't.
3188	
3189	DESDEMONA	Why, so I can, sir, but I will not now.
3190	This is a trick to put me from my suit:
3191	Pray you, let Cassio be received again.
3192	
3193	OTHELLO	Fetch me the handkerchief: my mind misgives.
3194	
3195	DESDEMONA	Come, come;
3196	You'll never meet a more sufficient man.
3197	
3198	OTHELLO	The handkerchief!
3199	
3200	DESDEMONA	                  I pray, talk me of Cassio.
3201	
3202	OTHELLO	The handkerchief!
3203	
3204	DESDEMONA	                  A man that all his time
3205	Hath founded his good fortunes on your love,
3206	Shared dangers with you,--
3207	
3208	OTHELLO	The handkerchief!
3209	
3210	DESDEMONA	In sooth, you are to blame.
3211	
3212	OTHELLO	Away!
3213	
3214	[Exit]
3215	
3216	EMILIA	Is not this man jealous?
3217	
3218	DESDEMONA	I ne'er saw this before.
3219	Sure, there's some wonder in this handkerchief:
3220	I am most unhappy in the loss of it.
3221	
3222	EMILIA	'Tis not a year or two shows us a man:
3223	They are all but stomachs, and we all but food;
3224	To eat us hungerly, and when they are full,
3225	They belch us. Look you, Cassio and my husband!
3226	
3227	[Enter CASSIO and IAGO]
3228	
3229	IAGO	There is no other way; 'tis she must do't:
3230	And, lo, the happiness! go, and importune her.
3231	
3232	DESDEMONA	How now, good Cassio! what's the news with you?
3233	
3234	CASSIO	Madam, my former suit: I do beseech you
3235	That by your virtuous means I may again
3236	Exist, and be a member of his love
3237	Whom I with all the office of my heart
3238	Entirely honour: I would not be delay'd.
3239	If my offence be of such mortal kind
3240	That nor my service past, nor present sorrows,
3241	Nor purposed merit in futurity,
3242	Can ransom me into his love again,
3243	But to know so must be my benefit;
3244	So shall I clothe me in a forced content,
3245	And shut myself up in some other course,
3246	To fortune's alms.
3247	
3248	DESDEMONA	                  Alas, thrice-gentle Cassio!
3249	My advocation is not now in tune;
3250	My lord is not my lord; nor should I know him,
3251	Were he in favour as in humour alter'd.
3252	So help me every spirit sanctified,
3253	As I have spoken for you all my best
3254	And stood within the blank of his displeasure
3255	For my free speech! you must awhile be patient:
3256	What I can do I will; and more I will
3257	Than for myself I dare: let that suffice you.
3258	
3259	IAGO	Is my lord angry?
3260	
3261	EMILIA	                  He went hence but now,
3262	And certainly in strange unquietness.
3263	
3264	IAGO	Can he be angry? I have seen the cannon,
3265	When it hath blown his ranks into the air,
3266	And, like the devil, from his very arm
3267	Puff'd his own brother:--and can he be angry?
3268	Something of moment then: I will go meet him:
3269	There's matter in't indeed, if he be angry.
3270	
3271	DESDEMONA	I prithee, do so.
3272	
3273	[Exit IAGO]
3274	
3275	Something, sure, of state,
3276	Either from Venice, or some unhatch'd practise
3277	Made demonstrable here in Cyprus to him,
3278	Hath puddled his clear spirit: and in such cases
3279	Men's natures wrangle with inferior things,
3280	Though great ones are their object. 'Tis even so;
3281	For let our finger ache, and it indues
3282	Our other healthful members even to that sense
3283	Of pain: nay, we must think men are not gods,
3284	Nor of them look for such observances
3285	As fit the bridal. Beshrew me much, Emilia,
3286	I was, unhandsome warrior as I am,
3287	Arraigning his unkindness with my soul;
3288	But now I find I had suborn'd the witness,
3289	And he's indicted falsely.
3290	
3291	EMILIA	Pray heaven it be state-matters, as you think,
3292	And no conception nor no jealous toy
3293	Concerning you.
3294	
3295	DESDEMONA	Alas the day! I never gave him cause.
3296	
3297	EMILIA	But jealous souls will not be answer'd so;
3298	They are not ever jealous for the cause,
3299	But jealous for they are jealous: 'tis a monster
3300	Begot upon itself, born on itself.
3301	
3302	DESDEMONA	Heaven keep that monster from Othello's mind!
3303	
3304	EMILIA	Lady, amen.
3305	
3306	DESDEMONA	I will go seek him. Cassio, walk hereabout:
3307	If I do find him fit, I'll move your suit
3308	And seek to effect it to my uttermost.
3309	
3310	CASSIO	I humbly thank your ladyship.
3311	
3312	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
3313	
3314	[Enter BIANCA]
3315	
3316	BIANCA	Save you, friend Cassio!
3317	
3318	CASSIO	What make you from home?
3319	How is it with you, my most fair Bianca?
3320	I' faith, sweet love, I was coming to your house.
3321	
3322	BIANCA	And I was going to your lodging, Cassio.
3323	What, keep a week away? seven days and nights?
3324	Eight score eight hours? and lovers' absent hours,
3325	More tedious than the dial eight score times?
3326	O weary reckoning!
3327	
3328	CASSIO	                  Pardon me, Bianca:
3329	I have this while with leaden thoughts been press'd:
3330	But I shall, in a more continuate time,
3331	Strike off this score of absence. Sweet Bianca,
3332	
3333	[Giving her DESDEMONA's handkerchief]
3334	
3335	Take me this work out.
3336	
3337	BIANCA	O Cassio, whence came this?
3338	This is some token from a newer friend:
3339	To the felt absence now I feel a cause:
3340	Is't come to this? Well, well.
3341	
3342	CASSIO	Go to, woman!
3343	Throw your vile guesses in the devil's teeth,
3344	From whence you have them. You are jealous now
3345	That this is from some mistress, some remembrance:
3346	No, in good troth, Bianca.
3347	
3348	BIANCA	Why, whose is it?
3349	
3350	CASSIO	I know not, sweet: I found it in my chamber.
3351	I like the work well: ere it be demanded--
3352	As like enough it will--I'ld have it copied:
3353	Take it, and do't; and leave me for this time.
3354	
3355	BIANCA	Leave you! wherefore?
3356	
3357	CASSIO	I do attend here on the general;
3358	And think it no addition, nor my wish,
3359	To have him see me woman'd.
3360	
3361	BIANCA	Why, I pray you?
3362	
3363	CASSIO	Not that I love you not.
3364	
3365	BIANCA	But that you do not love me.
3366	I pray you, bring me on the way a little,
3367	And say if I shall see you soon at night.
3368	
3369	CASSIO	'Tis but a little way that I can bring you;
3370	For I attend here: but I'll see you soon.
3371	
3372	BIANCA	'Tis very good; I must be circumstanced.
3373	
3374	[Exeunt]
3375	
3376	
3377	
3378	
3379	OTHELLO
3380	
3381	
3382	ACT IV
3383	
3384	
3385	
3386	SCENE I	Cyprus. Before the castle.
3387	
3388	
3389	[Enter OTHELLO and IAGO]
3390	
3391	IAGO	Will you think so?
3392	
3393	OTHELLO	                  Think so, Iago!
3394	
3395	IAGO	What,
3396	To kiss in private?
3397	
3398	OTHELLO	An unauthorized kiss.
3399	
3400	IAGO	Or to be naked with her friend in bed
3401	An hour or more, not meaning any harm?
3402	
3403	OTHELLO	Naked in bed, Iago, and not mean harm!
3404	It is hypocrisy against the devil:
3405	They that mean virtuously, and yet do so,
3406	The devil their virtue tempts, and they tempt heaven.
3407	
3408	IAGO	So they do nothing, 'tis a venial slip:
3409	But if I give my wife a handkerchief,--
3410	
3411	OTHELLO	What then?
3412	
3413	IAGO	Why, then, 'tis hers, my lord; and, being hers,
3414	She may, I think, bestow't on any man.
3415	
3416	OTHELLO	She is protectress of her honour too:
3417	May she give that?
3418	
3419	IAGO	Her honour is an essence that's not seen;
3420	They have it very oft that have it not:
3421	But, for the handkerchief,--
3422	
3423	OTHELLO	By heaven, I would most gladly have forgot it.
3424	Thou said'st, it comes o'er my memory,
3425	As doth the raven o'er the infected house,
3426	Boding to all--he had my handkerchief.
3427	
3428	IAGO	Ay, what of that?
3429	
3430	OTHELLO	                  That's not so good now.
3431	
3432	IAGO	What,
3433	If I had said I had seen him do you wrong?
3434	Or heard him say,--as knaves be such abroad,
3435	Who having, by their own importunate suit,
3436	Or voluntary dotage of some mistress,
3437	Convinced or supplied them, cannot choose
3438	But they must blab--
3439	
3440	OTHELLO	Hath he said any thing?
3441	
3442	IAGO	He hath, my lord; but be you well assured,
3443	No more than he'll unswear.
3444	
3445	OTHELLO	What hath he said?
3446	
3447	IAGO	'Faith, that he did--I know not what he did.
3448	
3449	OTHELLO	What? what?
3450	
3451	IAGO	Lie--
3452	
3453	OTHELLO	    With her?
3454	
3455	IAGO	With her, on her; what you will.
3456	
3457	OTHELLO	Lie with her! lie on her! We say lie on her, when
3458	they belie her. Lie with her! that's fulsome.
3459	--Handkerchief--confessions--handkerchief!--To
3460	confess, and be hanged for his labour;--first, to be
3461	hanged, and then to confess.--I tremble at it.
3462	Nature would not invest herself in such shadowing
3463	passion without some instruction. It is not words
3464	that shake me thus. Pish! Noses, ears, and lips.
3465	--Is't possible?--Confess--handkerchief!--O devil!--
3466	
3467	[Falls in a trance]
3468	
3469	IAGO	Work on,
3470	My medicine, work! Thus credulous fools are caught;
3471	And many worthy and chaste dames even thus,
3472	All guiltless, meet reproach. What, ho! my lord!
3473	My lord, I say! Othello!
3474	
3475	[Enter CASSIO]
3476	
3477	How now, Cassio!
3478	
3479	CASSIO	What's the matter?
3480	
3481	IAGO	My lord is fall'n into an epilepsy:
3482	This is his second fit; he had one yesterday.
3483	
3484	CASSIO	Rub him about the temples.
3485	
3486	IAGO	No, forbear;
3487	The lethargy must have his quiet course:
3488	If not, he foams at mouth and by and by
3489	Breaks out to savage madness. Look he stirs:
3490	Do you withdraw yourself a little while,
3491	He will recover straight: when he is gone,
3492	I would on great occasion speak with you.
3493	
3494	[Exit CASSIO]
3495	
3496	How is it, general? have you not hurt your head?
3497	
3498	OTHELLO	Dost thou mock me?
3499	
3500	IAGO	                  I mock you! no, by heaven.
3501	Would you would bear your fortune like a man!
3502	
3503	OTHELLO	A horned man's a monster and a beast.
3504	
3505	IAGO	There's many a beast then in a populous city,
3506	And many a civil monster.
3507	
3508	OTHELLO	Did he confess it?
3509	
3510	IAGO	                  Good sir, be a man;
3511	Think every bearded fellow that's but yoked
3512	May draw with you: there's millions now alive
3513	That nightly lie in those unproper beds
3514	Which they dare swear peculiar: your case is better.
3515	O, 'tis the spite of hell, the fiend's arch-mock,
3516	To lip a wanton in a secure couch,
3517	And to suppose her chaste! No, let me know;
3518	And knowing what I am, I know what she shall be.
3519	
3520	OTHELLO	O, thou art wise; 'tis certain.
3521	
3522	IAGO	Stand you awhile apart;
3523	Confine yourself but in a patient list.
3524	Whilst you were here o'erwhelmed with your grief--
3525	A passion most unsuiting such a man--
3526	Cassio came hither: I shifted him away,
3527	And laid good 'scuse upon your ecstasy,
3528	Bade him anon return and here speak with me;
3529	The which he promised. Do but encave yourself,
3530	And mark the fleers, the gibes, and notable scorns,
3531	That dwell in every region of his face;
3532	For I will make him tell the tale anew,
3533	Where, how, how oft, how long ago, and when
3534	He hath, and is again to cope your wife:
3535	I say, but mark his gesture. Marry, patience;
3536	Or I shall say you are all in all in spleen,
3537	And nothing of a man.
3538	
3539	OTHELLO	Dost thou hear, Iago?
3540	I will be found most cunning in my patience;
3541	But--dost thou hear?--most bloody.
3542	
3543	IAGO	That's not amiss;
3544	But yet keep time in all. Will you withdraw?
3545	
3546	[OTHELLO retires]
3547	
3548	Now will I question Cassio of Bianca,
3549	A housewife that by selling her desires
3550	Buys herself bread and clothes: it is a creature
3551	That dotes on Cassio; as 'tis the strumpet's plague
3552	To beguile many and be beguiled by one:
3553	He, when he hears of her, cannot refrain
3554	From the excess of laughter. Here he comes:
3555	
3556	[Re-enter CASSIO]
3557	
3558	As he shall smile, Othello shall go mad;
3559	And his unbookish jealousy must construe
3560	Poor Cassio's smiles, gestures and light behavior,
3561	Quite in the wrong. How do you now, lieutenant?
3562	
3563	CASSIO	The worser that you give me the addition
3564	Whose want even kills me.
3565	
3566	IAGO	Ply Desdemona well, and you are sure on't.
3567	
3568	[Speaking lower]
3569	
3570	Now, if this suit lay in Bianco's power,
3571	How quickly should you speed!
3572	
3573	CASSIO	Alas, poor caitiff!
3574	
3575	OTHELLO	Look, how he laughs already!
3576	
3577	IAGO	I never knew woman love man so.
3578	
3579	CASSIO	Alas, poor rogue! I think, i' faith, she loves me.
3580	
3581	OTHELLO	Now he denies it faintly, and laughs it out.
3582	
3583	IAGO	Do you hear, Cassio?
3584	
3585	OTHELLO	Now he importunes him
3586	To tell it o'er: go to; well said, well said.
3587	
3588	IAGO	She gives it out that you shall marry hey:
3589	Do you intend it?
3590	
3591	CASSIO	Ha, ha, ha!
3592	
3593	OTHELLO	Do you triumph, Roman? do you triumph?
3594	
3595	CASSIO	I marry her! what? a customer! Prithee, bear some
3596	charity to my wit: do not think it so unwholesome.
3597	Ha, ha, ha!
3598	
3599	OTHELLO	So, so, so, so: they laugh that win.
3600	
3601	IAGO	'Faith, the cry goes that you shall marry her.
3602	
3603	CASSIO	Prithee, say true.
3604	
3605	IAGO	I am a very villain else.
3606	
3607	OTHELLO	Have you scored me? Well.
3608	
3609	CASSIO	This is the monkey's own giving out: she is
3610	persuaded I will marry her, out of her own love and
3611	flattery, not out of my promise.
3612	
3613	OTHELLO	Iago beckons me; now he begins the story.
3614	
3615	CASSIO	She was here even now; she haunts me in every place.
3616	I was the other day talking on the sea-bank with
3617	certain Venetians; and thither comes the bauble,
3618	and, by this hand, she falls me thus about my neck--
3619	
3620	OTHELLO	Crying 'O dear Cassio!' as it were: his gesture
3621	imports it.
3622	
3623	CASSIO	So hangs, and lolls, and weeps upon me; so hales,
3624	and pulls me: ha, ha, ha!
3625	
3626	OTHELLO	Now he tells how she plucked him to my chamber. O,
3627	I see that nose of yours, but not that dog I shall
3628	throw it to.
3629	
3630	CASSIO	Well, I must leave her company.
3631	
3632	IAGO	Before me! look, where she comes.
3633	
3634	CASSIO	'Tis such another fitchew! marry a perfumed one.
3635	
3636	[Enter BIANCA]
3637	
3638	What do you mean by this haunting of me?
3639	
3640	BIANCA	Let the devil and his dam haunt you! What did you
3641	mean by that same handkerchief you gave me even now?
3642	I was a fine fool to take it. I must take out the
3643	work?--A likely piece of work, that you should find
3644	it in your chamber, and not know who left it there!
3645	This is some minx's token, and I must take out the
3646	work? There; give it your hobby-horse: wheresoever
3647	you had it, I'll take out no work on't.
3648	
3649	CASSIO	How now, my sweet Bianca! how now! how now!
3650	
3651	OTHELLO	By heaven, that should be my handkerchief!
3652	
3653	BIANCA	An you'll come to supper to-night, you may; an you
3654	will not, come when you are next prepared for.
3655	
3656	[Exit]
3657	
3658	IAGO	After her, after her.
3659	
3660	CASSIO	'Faith, I must; she'll rail in the street else.
3661	
3662	IAGO	Will you sup there?
3663	
3664	CASSIO	'Faith, I intend so.
3665	
3666	IAGO	Well, I may chance to see you; for I would very fain
3667	speak with you.
3668	
3669	CASSIO	Prithee, come; will you?
3670	
3671	IAGO	Go to; say no more.
3672	
3673	[Exit CASSIO]
3674	
3675	OTHELLO	[Advancing]  How shall I murder him, Iago?
3676	
3677	IAGO	Did you perceive how he laughed at his vice?
3678	
3679	OTHELLO	O Iago!
3680	
3681	IAGO	And did you see the handkerchief?
3682	
3683	OTHELLO	Was that mine?
3684	
3685	IAGO	Yours by this hand: and to see how he prizes the
3686	foolish woman your wife! she gave it him, and he
3687	hath given it his whore.
3688	
3689	OTHELLO	I would have him nine years a-killing.
3690	A fine woman! a fair woman! a sweet woman!
3691	
3692	IAGO	Nay, you must forget that.
3693	
3694	OTHELLO	Ay, let her rot, and perish, and be damned to-night;
3695	for she shall not live: no, my heart is turned to
3696	stone; I strike it, and it hurts my hand. O, the
3697	world hath not a sweeter creature: she might lie by
3698	an emperor's side and command him tasks.
3699	
3700	IAGO	Nay, that's not your way.
3701	
3702	OTHELLO	Hang her! I do but say what she is: so delicate
3703	with her needle: an admirable musician: O! she
3704	will sing the savageness out of a bear: of so high
3705	and plenteous wit and invention:--
3706	
3707	IAGO	She's the worse for all this.
3708	
3709	OTHELLO	O, a thousand thousand times: and then, of so
3710	gentle a condition!
3711	
3712	IAGO	Ay, too gentle.
3713	
3714	OTHELLO	Nay, that's certain: but yet the pity of it, Iago!
3715	O Iago, the pity of it, Iago!
3716	
3717	IAGO	If you are so fond over her iniquity, give her
3718	patent to offend; for, if it touch not you, it comes
3719	near nobody.
3720	
3721	OTHELLO	I will chop her into messes: cuckold me!
3722	
3723	IAGO	O, 'tis foul in her.
3724	
3725	OTHELLO	With mine officer!
3726	
3727	IAGO	That's fouler.
3728	
3729	OTHELLO	Get me some poison, Iago; this night: I'll not
3730	expostulate with her, lest her body and beauty
3731	unprovide my mind again: this night, Iago.
3732	
3733	IAGO	Do it not with poison, strangle her in her bed, even
3734	the bed she hath contaminated.
3735	
3736	OTHELLO	Good, good: the justice of it pleases: very good.
3737	
3738	IAGO	And for Cassio, let me be his undertaker: you
3739	shall hear more by midnight.
3740	
3741	OTHELLO	Excellent good.
3742	
3743	[A trumpet within]
3744	
3745	What trumpet is that same?
3746	
3747	IAGO	Something from Venice, sure. 'Tis Lodovico
3748	Come from the duke: and, see, your wife is with him.
3749	
3750	[Enter LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, and Attendants]
3751	
3752	LODOVICO	Save you, worthy general!
3753	
3754	OTHELLO	With all my heart, sir.
3755	
3756	LODOVICO	The duke and senators of Venice greet you.
3757	
3758	[Gives him a letter]
3759	
3760	OTHELLO	I kiss the instrument of their pleasures.
3761	
3762	[Opens the letter, and reads]
3763	
3764	DESDEMONA	And what's the news, good cousin Lodovico?
3765	
3766	IAGO	I am very glad to see you, signior
3767	Welcome to Cyprus.
3768	
3769	LODOVICO	I thank you. How does Lieutenant Cassio?
3770	
3771	IAGO	Lives, sir.
3772	
3773	DESDEMONA	Cousin, there's fall'n between him and my lord
3774	An unkind breach: but you shall make all well.
3775	
3776	OTHELLO	Are you sure of that?
3777	
3778	DESDEMONA	My lord?
3779	
3780	OTHELLO	[Reads]  'This fail you not to do, as you will--'
3781	
3782	LODOVICO	He did not call; he's busy in the paper.
3783	Is there division 'twixt my lord and Cassio?
3784	
3785	DESDEMONA	A most unhappy one: I would do much
3786	To atone them, for the love I bear to Cassio.
3787	
3788	OTHELLO	Fire and brimstone!
3789	
3790	DESDEMONA	My lord?
3791	
3792	OTHELLO	       Are you wise?
3793	
3794	DESDEMONA	What, is he angry?
3795	
3796	LODOVICO	                  May be the letter moved him;
3797	For, as I think, they do command him home,
3798	Deputing Cassio in his government.
3799	
3800	DESDEMONA	Trust me, I am glad on't.
3801	
3802	OTHELLO	Indeed!
3803	
3804	DESDEMONA	My lord?
3805	
3806	OTHELLO	I am glad to see you mad.
3807	
3808	DESDEMONA	Why, sweet Othello,--
3809	
3810	OTHELLO	[Striking her]  Devil!
3811	
3812	DESDEMONA	I have not deserved this.
3813	
3814	LODOVICO	My lord, this would not be believed in Venice,
3815	Though I should swear I saw't: 'tis very much:
3816	Make her amends; she weeps.
3817	
3818	OTHELLO	O devil, devil!
3819	If that the earth could teem with woman's tears,
3820	Each drop she falls would prove a crocodile.
3821	Out of my sight!
3822	
3823	DESDEMONA	I will not stay to offend you.
3824	
3825	[Going]
3826	
3827	LODOVICO	Truly, an obedient lady:
3828	I do beseech your lordship, call her back.
3829	
3830	OTHELLO	Mistress!
3831	
3832	DESDEMONA	        My lord?
3833	
3834	OTHELLO	What would you with her, sir?
3835	
3836	LODOVICO	Who, I, my lord?
3837	
3838	OTHELLO	Ay; you did wish that I would make her turn:
3839	Sir, she can turn, and turn, and yet go on,
3840	And turn again; and she can weep, sir, weep;
3841	And she's obedient, as you say, obedient,
3842	Very obedient. Proceed you in your tears.
3843	Concerning this, sir,--O  well-painted passion!--
3844	I am commanded home. Get you away;
3845	I'll send for you anon. Sir, I obey the mandate,
3846	And will return to Venice. Hence, avaunt!
3847	
3848	[Exit DESDEMONA]
3849	
3850	Cassio shall have my place. And, sir, tonight,
3851	I do entreat that we may sup together:
3852	You are welcome, sir, to Cyprus.--Goats and monkeys!
3853	
3854	[Exit]
3855	
3856	LODOVICO	Is this the noble Moor whom our full senate
3857	Call all in all sufficient? Is this the nature
3858	Whom passion could not shake? whose solid virtue
3859	The shot of accident, nor dart of chance,
3860	Could neither graze nor pierce?
3861	
3862	IAGO	He is much changed.
3863	
3864	LODOVICO	Are his wits safe? is he not light of brain?
3865	
3866	IAGO	He's that he is: I may not breathe my censure
3867	What he might be: if what he might he is not,
3868	I would to heaven he were!
3869	
3870	LODOVICO	What, strike his wife!
3871	
3872	IAGO	'Faith, that was not so well; yet would I knew
3873	That stroke would prove the worst!
3874	
3875	LODOVICO	Is it his use?
3876	Or did the letters work upon his blood,
3877	And new-create this fault?
3878	
3879	IAGO	Alas, alas!
3880	It is not honesty in me to speak
3881	What I have seen and known. You shall observe him,
3882	And his own courses will denote him so
3883	That I may save my speech: do but go after,
3884	And mark how he continues.
3885	
3886	LODOVICO	I am sorry that I am deceived in him.
3887	
3888	[Exeunt]
3889	
3890	
3891	
3892	
3893	OTHELLO
3894	
3895	
3896	ACT IV
3897	
3898	
3899	SCENE II	A room in the castle.
3900	
3901	
3902	[Enter OTHELLO and EMILIA]
3903	
3904	OTHELLO	You have seen nothing then?
3905	
3906	EMILIA	Nor ever heard, nor ever did suspect.
3907	
3908	OTHELLO	Yes, you have seen Cassio and she together.
3909	
3910	EMILIA	But then I saw no harm, and then I heard
3911	Each syllable that breath made up between them.
3912	
3913	OTHELLO	What, did they never whisper?
3914	
3915	EMILIA	Never, my lord.
3916	
3917	OTHELLO	Nor send you out o' the way?
3918	
3919	EMILIA	Never.
3920	
3921	OTHELLO	To fetch her fan, her gloves, her mask, nor nothing?
3922	
3923	EMILIA	Never, my lord.
3924	
3925	OTHELLO	That's strange.
3926	
3927	EMILIA	I durst, my lord, to wager she is honest,
3928	Lay down my soul at stake: if you think other,
3929	Remove your thought; it doth abuse your bosom.
3930	If any wretch have put this in your head,
3931	Let heaven requite it with the serpent's curse!
3932	For, if she be not honest, chaste, and true,
3933	There's no man happy; the purest of their wives
3934	Is foul as slander.
3935	
3936	OTHELLO	Bid her come hither: go.
3937	
3938	[Exit EMILIA]
3939	
3940	She says enough; yet she's a simple bawd
3941	That cannot say as much. This is a subtle whore,
3942	A closet lock and key of villanous secrets
3943	And yet she'll kneel and pray; I have seen her do't.
3944	
3945	[Enter DESDEMONA with EMILIA]
3946	
3947	DESDEMONA	My lord, what is your will?
3948	
3949	OTHELLO	Pray, chuck, come hither.
3950	
3951	DESDEMONA	What is your pleasure?
3952	
3953	OTHELLO	Let me see your eyes;
3954	Look in my face.
3955	
3956	DESDEMONA	                  What horrible fancy's this?
3957	
3958	OTHELLO	[To EMILIA]  Some of your function, mistress;
3959	Leave procreants alone and shut the door;
3960	Cough, or cry 'hem,' if any body come:
3961	Your mystery, your mystery: nay, dispatch.
3962	
3963	[Exit EMILIA]
3964	
3965	DESDEMONA	Upon my knees, what doth your speech import?
3966	I understand a fury in your words.
3967	But not the words.
3968	
3969	OTHELLO	Why, what art thou?
3970	
3971	DESDEMONA	Your wife, my lord; your true
3972	And loyal wife.
3973	
3974	OTHELLO	                  Come, swear it, damn thyself
3975	Lest, being like one of heaven, the devils themselves
3976	Should fear to seize thee: therefore be double damn'd:
3977	Swear thou art honest.
3978	
3979	DESDEMONA	Heaven doth truly know it.
3980	
3981	OTHELLO	Heaven truly knows that thou art false as hell.
3982	
3983	DESDEMONA	To whom, my lord? with whom? how am I false?
3984	
3985	OTHELLO	O Desdemona! away! away! away!
3986	
3987	DESDEMONA	Alas the heavy day! Why do you weep?
3988	Am I the motive of these tears, my lord?
3989	If haply you my father do suspect
3990	An instrument of this your calling back,
3991	Lay not your blame on me: If you have lost him,
3992	Why, I have lost him too.
3993	
3994	OTHELLO	Had it pleased heaven
3995	To try me with affliction; had they rain'd
3996	All kinds of sores and shames on my bare head.
3997	Steep'd me in poverty to the very lips,
3998	Given to captivity me and my utmost hopes,
3999	I should have found in some place of my soul
4000	A drop of patience: but, alas, to make me
4001	A fixed figure for the time of scorn
4002	To point his slow unmoving finger at!
4003	Yet could I bear that too; well, very well:
4004	But there, where I have garner'd up my heart,
4005	Where either I must live, or bear no life;
4006	The fountain from the which my current runs,
4007	Or else dries up; to be discarded thence!
4008	Or keep it as a cistern for foul toads
4009	To knot and gender in! Turn thy complexion there,
4010	Patience, thou young and rose-lipp'd cherubin,--
4011	Ay, there, look grim as hell!
4012	
4013	DESDEMONA	I hope my noble lord esteems me honest.
4014	
4015	OTHELLO	O, ay; as summer flies are in the shambles,
4016	That quicken even with blowing. O thou weed,
4017	Who art so lovely fair and smell'st so sweet
4018	That the sense aches at thee, would thou hadst
4019	ne'er been born!
4020	
4021	DESDEMONA	Alas, what ignorant sin have I committed?
4022	
4023	OTHELLO	Was this fair paper, this most goodly book,
4024	Made to write 'whore' upon? What committed!
4025	Committed! O thou public commoner!
4026	I should make very forges of my cheeks,
4027	That would to cinders burn up modesty,
4028	Did I but speak thy deeds. What committed!
4029	Heaven stops the nose at it and the moon winks,
4030	The bawdy wind that kisses all it meets
4031	Is hush'd within the hollow mine of earth,
4032	And will not hear it. What committed!
4033	Impudent strumpet!
4034	
4035	DESDEMONA	                  By heaven, you do me wrong.
4036	
4037	OTHELLO	Are you not a strumpet?
4038	
4039	DESDEMONA	No, as I am a Christian:
4040	If to preserve this vessel for my lord
4041	From any other foul unlawful touch
4042	Be not to be a strumpet, I am none.
4043	
4044	OTHELLO	What, not a whore?
4045	
4046	DESDEMONA	                  No, as I shall be saved.
4047	
4048	OTHELLO	Is't possible?
4049	
4050	DESDEMONA	                  O, heaven forgive us!
4051	
4052	OTHELLO	I cry you mercy, then:
4053	I took you for that cunning whore of Venice
4054	That married with Othello.
4055	
4056	[Raising his voice]
4057	
4058	You, mistress,
4059	That have the office opposite to Saint Peter,
4060	And keep the gate of hell!
4061	
4062	[Re-enter EMILIA]
4063	
4064	You, you, ay, you!
4065	We have done our course; there's money for your pains:
4066	I pray you, turn the key and keep our counsel.
4067	
4068	[Exit]
4069	
4070	EMILIA	Alas, what does this gentleman conceive?
4071	How do you, madam? how do you, my good lady?
4072	
4073	DESDEMONA	'Faith, half asleep.
4074	
4075	EMILIA	Good madam, what's the matter with my lord?
4076	
4077	DESDEMONA	With who?
4078	
4079	EMILIA	Why, with my lord, madam.
4080	
4081	DESDEMONA	Who is thy lord?
4082	
4083	EMILIA	                  He that is yours, sweet lady.
4084	
4085	DESDEMONA	I have none: do not talk to me, Emilia;
4086	I cannot weep; nor answer have I none,
4087	But what should go by water. Prithee, tonight
4088	Lay on my bed my wedding sheets: remember;
4089	And call thy husband hither.
4090	
4091	EMILIA	Here's a change indeed!
4092	
4093	[Exit]
4094	
4095	DESDEMONA	'Tis meet I should be used so, very meet.
4096	How have I been behaved, that he might stick
4097	The small'st opinion on my least misuse?
4098	
4099	[Re-enter EMILIA with IAGO]
4100	
4101	IAGO	What is your pleasure, madam?
4102	How is't with you?
4103	
4104	DESDEMONA	I cannot tell. Those that do teach young babes
4105	Do it with gentle means and easy tasks:
4106	He might have chid me so; for, in good faith,
4107	I am a child to chiding.
4108	
4109	IAGO	What's the matter, lady?
4110	
4111	EMILIA	Alas, Iago, my lord hath so bewhored her.
4112	Thrown such despite and heavy terms upon her,
4113	As true hearts cannot bear.
4114	
4115	DESDEMONA	Am I that name, Iago?
4116	
4117	IAGO	What name, fair lady?
4118	
4119	DESDEMONA	Such as she says my lord did say I was.
4120	
4121	EMILIA	He call'd her whore: a beggar in his drink
4122	Could not have laid such terms upon his callat.
4123	
4124	IAGO	Why did he so?
4125	
4126	DESDEMONA	I do not know; I am sure I am none such.
4127	
4128	IAGO	Do not weep, do not weep. Alas the day!
4129	
4130	EMILIA	Hath she forsook so many noble matches,
4131	Her father and her country and her friends,
4132	To be call'd whore? would it not make one weep?
4133	
4134	DESDEMONA	It is my wretched fortune.
4135	
4136	IAGO	Beshrew him for't!
4137	How comes this trick upon him?
4138	
4139	DESDEMONA	Nay, heaven doth know.
4140	
4141	EMILIA	I will be hang'd, if some eternal villain,
4142	Some busy and insinuating rogue,
4143	Some cogging, cozening slave, to get some office,
4144	Have not devised this slander; I'll be hang'd else.
4145	
4146	IAGO	Fie, there is no such man; it is impossible.
4147	
4148	DESDEMONA	If any such there be, heaven pardon him!
4149	
4150	EMILIA	A halter pardon him! and hell gnaw his bones!
4151	Why should he call her whore? who keeps her company?
4152	What place? what time? what form? what likelihood?
4153	The Moor's abused by some most villanous knave,
4154	Some base notorious knave, some scurvy fellow.
4155	O heaven, that such companions thou'ldst unfold,
4156	And put in every honest hand a whip
4157	To lash the rascals naked through the world
4158	Even from the east to the west!
4159	
4160	IAGO	Speak within door.
4161	
4162	EMILIA	O, fie upon them! Some such squire he was
4163	That turn'd your wit the seamy side without,
4164	And made you to suspect me with the Moor.
4165	
4166	IAGO	You are a fool; go to.
4167	
4168	DESDEMONA	O good Iago,
4169	What shall I do to win my lord again?
4170	Good friend, go to him; for, by this light of heaven,
4171	I know not how I lost him. Here I kneel:
4172	If e'er my will did trespass 'gainst his love,
4173	Either in discourse of thought or actual deed,
4174	Or that mine eyes, mine ears, or any sense,
4175	Delighted them in any other form;
4176	Or that I do not yet, and ever did.
4177	And ever will--though he do shake me off
4178	To beggarly divorcement--love him dearly,
4179	Comfort forswear me! Unkindness may do much;
4180	And his unkindness may defeat my life,
4181	But never taint my love. I cannot say 'whore:'
4182	It does abhor me now I speak the word;
4183	To do the act that might the addition earn
4184	Not the world's mass of vanity could make me.
4185	
4186	IAGO	I pray you, be content; 'tis but his humour:
4187	The business of the state does him offence,
4188	And he does chide with you.
4189	
4190	DESDEMONA	If 'twere no other--
4191	
4192	IAGO	'Tis but so, I warrant.
4193	
4194	[Trumpets within]
4195	
4196	Hark, how these instruments summon to supper!
4197	The messengers of Venice stay the meat;
4198	Go in, and weep not; all things shall be well.
4199	
4200	[Exeunt DESDEMONA and EMILIA]
4201	
4202	[Enter RODERIGO]
4203	
4204	How now, Roderigo!
4205	
4206	RODERIGO	I do not find that thou dealest justly with me.
4207	
4208	IAGO	What in the contrary?
4209	
4210	RODERIGO	Every day thou daffest me with some device, Iago;
4211	and rather, as it seems to me now, keepest from me
4212	all conveniency than suppliest me with the least
4213	advantage of hope. I will indeed no longer endure
4214	it, nor am I yet persuaded to put up in peace what
4215	already I have foolishly suffered.
4216	
4217	IAGO	Will you hear me, Roderigo?
4218	
4219	RODERIGO	'Faith, I have heard too much, for your words and
4220	performances are no kin together.
4221	
4222	IAGO	You charge me most unjustly.
4223	
4224	RODERIGO	With nought but truth. I have wasted myself out of
4225	my means. The jewels you have had from me to
4226	deliver to Desdemona would half have corrupted a
4227	votarist: you have told me she hath received them
4228	and returned me expectations and comforts of sudden
4229	respect and acquaintance, but I find none.
4230	
4231	IAGO	Well; go to; very well.
4232	
4233	RODERIGO	Very well! go to! I cannot go to, man; nor 'tis
4234	not very well: nay, I think it is scurvy, and begin
4235	to find myself fobbed in it.
4236	
4237	IAGO	Very well.
4238	
4239	RODERIGO	I tell you 'tis not very well. I will make myself
4240	known to Desdemona: if she will return me my
4241	jewels, I will give over my suit and repent my
4242	unlawful solicitation; if not, assure yourself I
4243	will seek satisfaction of you.
4244	
4245	IAGO	You have said now.
4246	
4247	RODERIGO	Ay, and said nothing but what I protest intendment of doing.
4248	
4249	IAGO	Why, now I see there's mettle in thee, and even from
4250	this instant to build on thee a better opinion than
4251	ever before. Give me thy hand, Roderigo: thou hast
4252	taken against me a most just exception; but yet, I
4253	protest, I have dealt most directly in thy affair.
4254	
4255	RODERIGO	It hath not appeared.
4256	
4257	IAGO	I grant indeed it hath not appeared, and your
4258	suspicion is not without wit and judgment. But,
4259	Roderigo, if thou hast that in thee indeed, which I
4260	have greater reason to believe now than ever, I mean
4261	purpose, courage and valour, this night show it: if
4262	thou the next night following enjoy not Desdemona,
4263	take me from this world with treachery and devise
4264	engines for my life.
4265	
4266	RODERIGO	Well, what is it? is it within reason and compass?
4267	
4268	IAGO	Sir, there is especial commission come from Venice
4269	to depute Cassio in Othello's place.
4270	
4271	RODERIGO	Is that true? why, then Othello and Desdemona
4272	return again to Venice.
4273	
4274	IAGO	O, no; he goes into Mauritania and takes away with
4275	him the fair Desdemona, unless his abode be
4276	lingered here by some accident: wherein none can be
4277	so determinate as the removing of Cassio.
4278	
4279	RODERIGO	How do you mean, removing of him?
4280	
4281	IAGO	Why, by making him uncapable of Othello's place;
4282	knocking out his brains.
4283	
4284	RODERIGO	And that you would have me to do?
4285	
4286	IAGO	Ay, if you dare do yourself a profit and a right.
4287	He sups to-night with a harlotry, and thither will I
4288	go to him: he knows not yet of his horrorable
4289	fortune. If you will watch his going thence, which
4290	I will fashion to fall out between twelve and one,
4291	you may take him at your pleasure: I will be near
4292	to second your attempt, and he shall fall between
4293	us. Come, stand not amazed at it, but go along with
4294	me; I will show you such a necessity in his death
4295	that you shall think yourself bound to put it on
4296	him. It is now high suppertime, and the night grows
4297	to waste: about it.
4298	
4299	RODERIGO	I will hear further reason for this.
4300	
4301	IAGO	And you shall be satisfied.
4302

4313	
4314	
4315	SCENE III	Another room in the castle.
4316	
4317	
4318	[Enter OTHELLO, LODOVICO, DESDEMONA, EMILIA and
4319	Attendants]
4320	
4321	LODOVICO	I do beseech you, sir, trouble yourself no further.
4322	
4323	OTHELLO	O, pardon me: 'twill do me good to walk.
4324	
4325	LODOVICO	Madam, good night; I humbly thank your ladyship.
4326	
4327	DESDEMONA	Your honour is most welcome.
4328	
4329	OTHELLO	Will you walk, sir?
4330	O,--Desdemona,--
4331	
4332	DESDEMONA	My lord?
4333	
4334	OTHELLO	Get you to bed on the instant; I will be returned
4335	forthwith: dismiss your attendant there: look it be done.
4336	
4337	DESDEMONA	I will, my lord.
4338	
4339	[Exeunt OTHELLO, LODOVICO, and Attendants]
4340	
4341	EMILIA	How goes it now? he looks gentler than he did.
4342	
4343	DESDEMONA	He says he will return incontinent:
4344	He hath commanded me to go to bed,
4345	And bade me to dismiss you.
4346	
4347	EMILIA	Dismiss me!
4348	
4349	DESDEMONA	It was his bidding: therefore, good Emilia,.
4350	Give me my nightly wearing, and adieu:
4351	We must not now displease him.
4352	
4353	EMILIA	I would you had never seen him!
4354	
4355	DESDEMONA	So would not I	my love doth so approve him,
4356	That even his stubbornness, his cheques, his frowns--
4357	Prithee, unpin me,--have grace and favour in them.
4358	
4359	EMILIA	I have laid those sheets you bade me on the bed.
4360	
4361	DESDEMONA	All's one. Good faith, how foolish are our minds!
4362	If I do die before thee prithee, shroud me
4363	In one of those same sheets.
4364	
4365	EMILIA	Come, come you talk.
4366	
4367	DESDEMONA	My mother had a maid call'd Barbara:
4368	She was in love, and he she loved proved mad
4369	And did forsake her: she had a song of 'willow;'
4370	An old thing 'twas, but it express'd her fortune,
4371	And she died singing it: that song to-night
4372	Will not go from my mind; I have much to do,
4373	But to go hang my head all at one side,
4374	And sing it like poor Barbara. Prithee, dispatch.
4375	
4376	EMILIA	Shall I go fetch your night-gown?
4377	
4378	DESDEMONA	No, unpin me here.
4379	This Lodovico is a proper man.
4380	
4381	EMILIA	A very handsome man.
4382	
4383	DESDEMONA	He speaks well.
4384	
4385	EMILIA	I know a lady in Venice would have walked barefoot
4386	to Palestine for a touch of his nether lip.
4387	
4388	DESDEMONA	[Singing]  The poor soul sat sighing by a sycamore tree,
4389	Sing all a green willow:
4390	Her hand on her bosom, her head on her knee,
4391	Sing willow, willow, willow:
4392	The fresh streams ran by her, and murmur'd her moans;
4393	Sing willow, willow, willow;
4394	Her salt tears fell from her, and soften'd the stones;
4395	Lay by these:--
4396	
4397	[Singing]
4398	
4399	Sing willow, willow, willow;
4400	Prithee, hie thee; he'll come anon:--
4401	
4402	[Singing]
4403	
4404	Sing all a green willow must be my garland.
4405	Let nobody blame him; his scorn I approve,-
4406	Nay, that's not next.--Hark! who is't that knocks?
4407	
4408	EMILIA	It's the wind.
4409	
4410	DESDEMONA	[Singing]  I call'd my love false love; but what
4411	said he then?
4412	Sing willow, willow, willow:
4413	If I court moe women, you'll couch with moe men!
4414	So, get thee gone; good night Ate eyes do itch;
4415	Doth that bode weeping?
4416	
4417	EMILIA	'Tis neither here nor there.
4418	
4419	DESDEMONA	I have heard it said so. O, these men, these men!
4420	Dost thou in conscience think,--tell me, Emilia,--
4421	That there be women do abuse their husbands
4422	In such gross kind?
4423	
4424	EMILIA	There be some such, no question.
4425	
4426	DESDEMONA	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
4427	
4428	EMILIA	Why, would not you?
4429	
4430	DESDEMONA	No, by this heavenly light!
4431	
4432	EMILIA	Nor I neither by this heavenly light;
4433	I might do't as well i' the dark.
4434	
4435	DESDEMONA	Wouldst thou do such a deed for all the world?
4436	
4437	EMILIA	The world's a huge thing: it is a great price.
4438	For a small vice.
4439	
4440	DESDEMONA	In troth, I think thou wouldst not.
4441	
4442	EMILIA	In troth, I think I should; and undo't when I had
4443	done. Marry, I would not do such a thing for a
4444	joint-ring, nor for measures of lawn, nor for
4445	gowns, petticoats, nor caps, nor any petty
4446	exhibition; but for the whole world,--why, who would
4447	not make her husband a cuckold to make him a
4448	monarch? I should venture purgatory for't.
4449	
4450	DESDEMONA	Beshrew me, if I would do such a wrong
4451	For the whole world.
4452	
4453	EMILIA	Why the wrong is but a wrong i' the world: and
4454	having the world for your labour, tis a wrong in your
4455	own world, and you might quickly make it right.
4456	
4457	DESDEMONA	I do not think there is any such woman.
4458	
4459	EMILIA	Yes, a dozen; and as many to the vantage as would
4460	store the world they played for.
4461	But I do think it is their husbands' faults
4462	If wives do fall: say that they slack their duties,
4463	And pour our treasures into foreign laps,
4464	Or else break out in peevish jealousies,
4465	Throwing restraint upon us; or say they strike us,
4466	Or scant our former having in despite;
4467	Why, we have galls, and though we have some grace,
4468	Yet have we some revenge. Let husbands know
4469	Their wives have sense like them: they see and smell
4470	And have their palates both for sweet and sour,
4471	As husbands have. What is it that they do
4472	When they change us for others? Is it sport?
4473	I think it is: and doth affection breed it?
4474	I think it doth: is't frailty that thus errs?
4475	It is so too: and have not we affections,
4476	Desires for sport, and frailty, as men have?
4477	Then let them use us well: else let them know,
4478	The ills we do, their ills instruct us so.
4479	
4480	DESDEMONA	Good night, good night: heaven me such uses send,
4481	Not to pick bad from bad, but by bad mend!
4482

4495	SCENE I	Cyprus. A street.
4496	
4497	
4498	[Enter IAGO and RODERIGO]
4499	
4500	IAGO	Here, stand behind this bulk; straight will he come:
4501	Wear thy good rapier bare, and put it home:
4502	Quick, quick; fear nothing; I'll be at thy elbow:
4503	It makes us, or it mars us; think on that,
4504	And fix most firm thy resolution.
4505	
4506	RODERIGO	Be near at hand; I may miscarry in't.
4507	
4508	IAGO	Here, at thy hand: be bold, and take thy stand.
4509	
4510	[Retires]
4511	
4512	RODERIGO	I have no great devotion to the deed;
4513	And yet he hath given me satisfying reasons:
4514	'Tis but a man gone. Forth, my sword: he dies.
4515	
4516	IAGO	I have rubb'd this young quat almost to the sense,
4517	And he grows angry. Now, whether he kill Cassio,
4518	Or Cassio him, or each do kill the other,
4519	Every way makes my gain: live Roderigo,
4520	He calls me to a restitution large
4521	Of gold and jewels that I bobb'd from him,
4522	As gifts to Desdemona;
4523	It must not be: if Cassio do remain,
4524	He hath a daily beauty in his life
4525	That makes me ugly; and, besides, the Moor
4526	May unfold me to him; there stand I in much peril:
4527	No, he must die. But so: I hear him coming.
4528	
4529	[Enter CASSIO]
4530	
4531	RODERIGO	I know his gait, 'tis he.--Villain, thou diest!
4532	
4533	[Makes a pass at CASSIO]
4534	
4535	CASSIO	That thrust had been mine enemy indeed,
4536	But that my coat is better than thou know'st
4537	I will make proof of thine.
4538	
4539	[Draws, and wounds RODERIGO]
4540	
4541	RODERIGO	O, I am slain!
4542	
4543	[IAGO from behind wounds CASSIO in the leg, and exit]
4544	
4545	CASSIO	I am maim'd for ever. Help, ho! murder! murder!
4546	
4547	[Falls]
4548	
4549	[Enter OTHELLO]
4550	
4551	OTHELLO	The voice of Cassio: Iago keeps his word.
4552	
4553	RODERIGO	O, villain that I am!
4554	
4555	OTHELLO	It is even so.
4556	
4557	CASSIO	O, help, ho! light! a surgeon!
4558	
4559	OTHELLO	'Tis he:--O brave Iago, honest and just,
4560	That hast such noble sense of thy friend's wrong!
4561	Thou teachest me. Minion, your dear lies dead,
4562	And your unblest fate hies: strumpet, I come.
4563	Forth of my heart those charms, thine eyes, are blotted;
4564	Thy bed, lust-stain'd, shall with lust's blood be spotted.
4565	
4566	[Exit]
4567	
4568	[Enter LODOVICO and GRATIANO]
4569	
4570	CASSIO	What, ho! no watch? no passage? murder! murder!
4571	
4572	GRATIANO	'Tis some mischance; the cry is very direful.
4573	
4574	CASSIO	O, help!
4575	
4576	LODOVICO	Hark!
4577	
4578	RODERIGO	O wretched villain!
4579	
4580	LODOVICO	Two or three groan: it is a heavy night:
4581	These may be counterfeits: let's think't unsafe
4582	To come in to the cry without more help.
4583	
4584	RODERIGO	Nobody come? then shall I bleed to death.
4585	
4586	LODOVICO	Hark!
4587	
4588	[Re-enter IAGO, with a light]
4589	
4590	GRATIANO	Here's one comes in his shirt, with light and weapons.
4591	
4592	IAGO	Who's there? whose noise is this that ones on murder?
4593	
4594	LODOVICO	We do not know.
4595	
4596	IAGO	                  Did not you hear a cry?
4597	
4598	CASSIO	Here, here! for heaven's sake, help me!
4599	
4600	IAGO	What's the matter?
4601	
4602	GRATIANO	This is Othello's ancient, as I take it.
4603	
4604	LODOVICO	The same indeed; a very valiant fellow.
4605	
4606	IAGO	What are you here that cry so grievously?
4607	
4608	CASSIO	Iago? O, I am spoil'd, undone by villains!
4609	Give me some help.
4610	
4611	IAGO	O me, lieutenant! what villains have done this?
4612	
4613	CASSIO	I think that one of them is hereabout,
4614	And cannot make away.
4615	
4616	IAGO	O treacherous villains!
4617	What are you there? come in, and give some help.
4618	
4619	[To LODOVICO and GRATIANO]
4620	
4621	RODERIGO	O, help me here!
4622	
4623	CASSIO	That's one of them.
4624	
4625	IAGO	O murderous slave! O villain!
4626	
4627	[Stabs RODERIGO]
4628	
4629	RODERIGO	O damn'd Iago! O inhuman dog!
4630	
4631	IAGO	Kill men i' the dark!--Where be these bloody thieves?--
4632	How silent is this town!--Ho! murder! murder!--
4633	What may you be? are you of good or evil?
4634	
4635	LODOVICO	As you shall prove us, praise us.
4636	
4637	IAGO	Signior Lodovico?
4638	
4639	LODOVICO	He, sir.
4640	
4641	IAGO	I cry you mercy. Here's Cassio hurt by villains.
4642	
4643	GRATIANO	Cassio!
4644	
4645	IAGO	How is't, brother!
4646	
4647	CASSIO	My leg is cut in two.
4648	
4649	IAGO	Marry, heaven forbid!
4650	Light, gentlemen; I'll bind it with my shirt.
4651	
4652	[Enter BIANCA]
4653	
4654	BIANCA	What is the matter, ho? who is't that cried?
4655	
4656	IAGO	Who is't that cried!
4657	
4658	BIANCA	O my dear Cassio! my sweet Cassio! O Cassio,
4659	Cassio, Cassio!
4660	
4661	IAGO	O notable strumpet! Cassio, may you suspect
4662	Who they should be that have thus many led you?
4663	
4664	CASSIO	No.
4665	
4666	GRATIANO	I am to find you thus: I have been to seek you.
4667	
4668	IAGO	Lend me a garter. So. O, for a chair,
4669	To bear him easily hence!
4670	
4671	BIANCA	Alas, he faints! O Cassio, Cassio, Cassio!
4672	
4673	IAGO	Gentlemen all, I do suspect this trash
4674	To be a party in this injury.
4675	Patience awhile, good Cassio. Come, come;
4676	Lend me a light. Know we this face or no?
4677	Alas my friend and my dear countryman
4678	Roderigo! no:--yes, sure: O heaven! Roderigo.
4679	
4680	GRATIANO	What, of Venice?
4681	
4682	IAGO	Even he, sir; did you know him?
4683	
4684	GRATIANO	Know him! ay.
4685	
4686	IAGO	Signior Gratiano? I cry you gentle pardon;
4687	These bloody accidents must excuse my manners,
4688	That so neglected you.
4689	
4690	GRATIANO	I am glad to see you.
4691	
4692	IAGO	How do you, Cassio? O, a chair, a chair!
4693	
4694	GRATIANO	Roderigo!
4695	
4696	IAGO	He, he 'tis he.
4697	
4698	[A chair brought in]
4699	
4700	O, that's well said; the chair!
4701	
4702	GRATIANO	Some good man bear him carefully from hence;
4703	I'll fetch the general's surgeon.
4704	
4705	[To BIANCA]
4706	
4707	For you, mistress,
4708	Save you your labour. He that lies slain
4709	here, Cassio,
4710	Was my dear friend: what malice was between you?
4711	
4712	CASSIO	None in the world; nor do I know the man.
4713	
4714	IAGO	[To BIANCA]  What, look you pale? O, bear him out
4715	o' the air.
4716	
4717	[CASSIO and RODERIGO are borne off]
4718	
4719	Stay you, good gentlemen. Look you pale, mistress?
4720	Do you perceive the gastness of her eye?
4721	Nay, if you stare, we shall hear more anon.
4722	Behold her well; I pray you, look upon her:
4723	Do you see, gentlemen? nay, guiltiness will speak,
4724	Though tongues were out of use.
4725	
4726	[Enter EMILIA]
4727	
4728	EMILIA	'Las, what's the matter? what's the matter, husband?
4729	
4730	IAGO	Cassio hath here been set on in the dark
4731	By Roderigo and fellows that are scaped:
4732	He's almost slain, and Roderigo dead.
4733	
4734	EMILIA	Alas, good gentleman! alas, good Cassio!
4735	
4736	IAGO	This is the fruit of whoring. Prithee, Emilia,
4737	Go know of Cassio where he supp'd to-night.
4738	
4739	[To BIANCA]
4740	
4741	What, do you shake at that?
4742	
4743	BIANCA	He supp'd at my house; but I therefore shake not.
4744	
4745	IAGO	O, did he so? I charge you, go with me.
4746	
4747	EMILIA	Fie, fie upon thee, strumpet!
4748	
4749	BIANCA	I am no strumpet; but of life as honest
4750	As you that thus abuse me.
4751	
4752	EMILIA	As I! foh! fie upon thee!
4753	
4754	IAGO	Kind gentlemen, let's go see poor Cassio dress'd.
4755	Come, mistress, you must tell's another tale.
4756	Emilia run you to the citadel,
4757	And tell my lord and lady what hath happ'd.
4758	Will you go on? I pray.
4759	
4760	[Aside]

4782	
4783	OTHELLO	It is the cause, it is the cause, my soul,--

4786	Nor scar that whiter skin of hers than snow,
4787	And smooth as monumental alabaster.
4788	Yet she must die, else she'll betray more men.
4789	Put out the light, and then put out the light:
4790	If I quench thee, thou flaming minister,
4791	I can again thy former light restore,
4792	Should I repent me: but once put out thy light,
4793	Thou cunning'st pattern of excelling nature,
4794	I know not where is that Promethean heat
4795	That can thy light relume. When I have pluck'd the rose,
4796	I cannot give it vital growth again.
4797	It must needs wither: I'll smell it on the tree.
4798	
4799	[Kissing her]
4800	
4801	Ah balmy breath, that dost almost persuade
4802	Justice to break her sword! One more, one more.
4803	Be thus when thou art dead, and I will kill thee,
4804	And love thee after. One more, and this the last:
4805	So sweet was ne'er so fatal. I must weep,
4806	But they are cruel tears: this sorrow's heavenly;
4807	It strikes where it doth love. She wakes.
4808	
4809	DESDEMONA	Who's there? Othello?
4810	
4811	OTHELLO	Ay. Desdemona.
4812	
4813	DESDEMONA	Will you come to bed, my lord?
4814	
4815	OTHELLO	Have you pray'd to-night, Desdemona?
4816	
4817	DESDEMONA	Ay, my lord.
4818	
4819	OTHELLO	If you bethink yourself of any crime
4820	Unreconciled as yet to heaven and grace,
4821	Solicit for it straight.
4822	
4823	DESDEMONA	Alas, my lord, what do you mean by that?
4824	
4825	OTHELLO	Well, do it, and be brief; I will walk by:
4826	I would not kill thy unprepared spirit;
4827	No; heaven forfend! I would not kill thy soul.
4828	
4829	DESDEMONA	Talk you of killing?
4830	
4831	OTHELLO	Ay, I do.
4832	
4833	DESDEMONA	Then heaven
4834	Have mercy on me!
4835	
4836	OTHELLO	                  Amen, with all my heart!
4837	
4838	DESDEMONA	If you say so, I hope you will not kill me.
4839	
4840	OTHELLO	Hum!
4841	
4842	DESDEMONA	And yet I fear you; for you are fatal then
4843	When your eyes roll so: why I should fear I know not,
4844	Since guiltiness I know not; but yet I feel I fear.
4845	
4846	OTHELLO	Think on thy sins.
4847	
4848	DESDEMONA	                  They are loves I bear to you.
4849	
4850	OTHELLO	Ay, and for that thou diest.
4851	
4852	DESDEMONA	That death's unnatural that kills for loving.
4853	Alas, why gnaw you so your nether lip?
4854	Some bloody passion shakes your very frame:
4855	These are portents; but yet I hope, I hope,
4856	They do not point on me.
4857	
4858	OTHELLO	Peace, and be still!
4859	
4860	DESDEMONA	I will so. What's the matter?
4861	
4862	OTHELLO	That handkerchief which I so loved and gave thee
4863	Thou gavest to Cassio.
4864	
4865	DESDEMONA	No, by my life and soul!
4866	Send for the man, and ask him.
4867	
4868	OTHELLO	Sweet soul, take heed,
4869	Take heed of perjury; thou art on thy deathbed.
4870	
4871	DESDEMONA	Ay, but not yet to die.
4872	
4873	OTHELLO	Yes, presently:
4874	Therefore confess thee freely of thy sin;
4875	For to deny each article with oath
4876	Cannot remove nor choke the strong conception
4877	That I do groan withal. Thou art to die.
4878	
4879	DESDEMONA	Then Lord have mercy on me!
4880	
4881	OTHELLO	I say, amen.
4882	
4883	DESDEMONA	And have you mercy too! I never did
4884	Offend you in my life; never loved Cassio
4885	But with such general warranty of heaven
4886	As I might love: I never gave him token.
4887	
4888	OTHELLO	By heaven, I saw my handkerchief in's hand.
4889	O perjured woman! thou dost stone my heart,
4890	And makest me call what I intend to do
4891	A murder, which I thought a sacrifice:
4892	I saw the handkerchief.
4893	
4894	DESDEMONA	He found it then;
4895	I never gave it him: send for him hither;
4896	Let him confess a truth.
4897	
4898	OTHELLO	He hath confess'd.
4899	
4900	DESDEMONA	What, my lord?
4901	
4902	OTHELLO	That he hath used thee.
4903	
4904	DESDEMONA	How? unlawfully?
4905	
4906	OTHELLO	Ay.
4907	
4908	DESDEMONA	He will not say so.
4909	
4910	OTHELLO	No, his mouth is stopp'd;
4911	Honest Iago hath ta'en order for't.
4912	
4913	DESDEMONA	O! my fear interprets: what, is he dead?
4914	
4915	OTHELLO	Had all his hairs been lives, my great revenge
4916	Had stomach for them all.
4917	
4918	DESDEMONA	Alas! he is betray'd and I undone.
4919	
4920	OTHELLO	Out, strumpet! weep'st thou for him to my face?
4921	
4922	DESDEMONA	O, banish me, my lord, but kill me not!
4923	
4924	OTHELLO	Down, strumpet!
4925	
4926	DESDEMONA	Kill me to-morrow: let me live to-night!
4927	
4928	OTHELLO	Nay, if you strive--
4929	
4930	DESDEMONA	But half an hour!
4931	
4932	OTHELLO	                  Being done, there is no pause.
4933	
4934	DESDEMONA	But while I say one prayer!
4935	
4936	OTHELLO	It is too late.
4937	
4938	[He stifles her]
4939	
4940	EMILIA	[Within]  My lord, my lord! what, ho! my lord, my lord!
4941	
4942	OTHELLO	What noise is this? Not dead? not yet quite dead?
4943	I that am cruel am yet merciful;
4944	I would not have thee linger in thy pain: So, so.
4945	
4946	EMILIA	[Within]  What, ho! my lord, my lord!
4947	
4948	OTHELLO	Who's there?
4949	
4950	EMILIA	[Within]  O, good my lord, I would speak a word with you!
4951	
4952	OTHELLO	Yes: 'tis Emilia. By and by. She's dead.
4953	'Tis like she comes to speak of Cassio's death.--
4954	The noise was here. Ha! no more moving?
4955	Still as the grave. Shall she come in? were't good?--
4956	I think she stirs again:--no. What's best to do?
4957	If she come in, she'll sure speak to my wife:
4958	My wife! my wife! what wife? I have no wife.
4959	O insupportable! O heavy hour!
4960	Methinks it should be now a huge eclipse
4961	Of sun and moon, and that the affrighted globe
4962	Should yawn at alteration.
4963	
4964	EMILIA	[Within]  I do beseech you
4965	That I may speak with you, O, good my lord!
4966	
4967	OTHELLO	I had forgot thee: O, come in, Emilia;
4968	Soft; by and by. Let me the curtains draw.
4969	Where art thou?
4970	
4971	[Unlocks the door]
4972	
4973	[Enter EMILIA]
4974	
4975	What's the matter with thee now?
4976	
4977	EMILIA	O, my good lord, yonder's foul murders done!
4978	
4979	OTHELLO	What, now?
4980	
4981	EMILIA	But now, my lord.
4982	
4983	OTHELLO	It is the very error of the moon;
4984	She comes more nearer earth than she was wont,
4985	And makes men mad.
4986	
4987	EMILIA	Cassio, my lord, hath kill'd a young Venetian
4988	Call'd Roderigo.
4989	
4990	OTHELLO	                  Roderigo kill'd!
4991	And Cassio kill'd!
4992	
4993	EMILIA	No, Cassio is not kill'd.
4994	
4995	OTHELLO	Not Cassio kill'd! then murder's out of tune,
4996	And sweet revenge grows harsh.
4997	
4998	DESDEMONA	O, falsely, falsely murder'd!
4999	
5000	EMILIA	Alas, what cry is that?
5001	
5002	OTHELLO	That! what?
5003	
5004	EMILIA	Out, and alas! that was my lady's voice.
5005	Help! help, ho! help! O lady, speak again!
5006	Sweet Desdemona! O sweet mistress, speak!
5007	
5008	DESDEMONA	A guiltless death I die.
5009	
5010	EMILIA	O, who hath done this deed?
5011	
5012	DESDEMONA	Nobody; I myself. Farewell
5013	Commend me to my kind lord: O, farewell!
5014	
5015	[Dies]
5016	
5017	OTHELLO	Why, how should she be murder'd?
5018	
5019	EMILIA	Alas, who knows?
5020	
5021	OTHELLO	You heard her say herself, it was not I.
5022	
5023	EMILIA	She said so: I must needs report the truth.
5024	
5025	OTHELLO	She's, like a liar, gone to burning hell:
5026	'Twas I that kill'd her.
5027	
5028	EMILIA	O, the more angel she,
5029	And you the blacker devil!
5030	
5031	OTHELLO	She turn'd to folly, and she was a whore.
5032	
5033	EMILIA	Thou dost belie her, and thou art a devil.
5034	
5035	OTHELLO	She was false as water.
5036	
5037	EMILIA	Thou art rash as fire, to say
5038	That she was false: O, she was heavenly true!
5039	
5040	OTHELLO	Cassio did top her; ask thy husband else.
5041	O, I were damn'd beneath all depth in hell,
5042	But that I did proceed upon just grounds
5043	To this extremity. Thy husband knew it all.
5044	
5045	EMILIA	My husband!
5046	
5047	OTHELLO	Thy husband.
5048	
5049	EMILIA	That she was false to wedlock?
5050	
5051	OTHELLO	Ay, with Cassio. Nay, had she been true,
5052	If heaven would make me such another world
5053	Of one entire and Perfect chrysolite,
5054	I'ld not have sold her for it.
5055	
5056	EMILIA	My husband!
5057	
5058	OTHELLO	          Ay, 'twas he that told me first:
5059	An honest man he is, and hates the slime
5060	That sticks on filthy deeds.
5061	
5062	EMILIA	My husband!
5063	
5064	OTHELLO	What needs this iteration, woman? I say thy husband.
5065	
5066	EMILIA	O mistress, villany hath made mocks with love,
5067	My husband say that she was false!
5068	
5069	OTHELLO	He, woman;
5070	I say thy husband: dost understand the word?
5071	My friend, thy husband, honest, honest Iago.
5072	
5073	EMILIA	If he say so, may his pernicious soul
5074	Rot half a grain a day! he lies to the heart:
5075	She was too fond of her most filthy bargain.
5076	
5077	OTHELLO	Ha!
5078	
5079	EMILIA	Do thy worst:
5080	This deed of thine is no more worthy heaven
5081	Than thou wast worthy her.
5082	
5083	OTHELLO	Peace, you were best.
5084	
5085	EMILIA	Thou hast not half that power to do me harm
5086	As I have to be hurt. O gull! O dolt!
5087	As ignorant as dirt! thou hast done a deed--
5088	I care not for thy sword; I'll make thee known,
5089	Though I lost twenty lives.--Help! help, ho! help!
5090	The Moor hath kill'd my mistress! Murder! murder!
5091	
5092	[Enter MONTANO, GRATIANO, IAGO, and others]
5093	
5094	MONTANO	What is the matter? How now, general!
5095	
5096	EMILIA	O, are you come, Iago? you have done well,
5097	That men must lay their murders on your neck.
5098	
5099	GRATIANO	What is the matter?
5100	
5101	EMILIA	Disprove this villain, if thou be'st a man:
5102	He says thou told'st him that his wife was false:
5103	I know thou didst not, thou'rt not such a villain:
5104	Speak, for my heart is full.
5105	
5106	IAGO	I told him what I thought, and told no more
5107	Than what he found himself was apt and true.
5108	
5109	EMILIA	But did you ever tell him she was false?
5110	
5111	IAGO	I did.
5112	
5113	EMILIA	You told a lie, an odious, damned lie;
5114	Upon my soul, a lie, a wicked lie.
5115	She false with Cassio!--did you say with Cassio?
5116	
5117	IAGO	With Cassio, mistress. Go to, charm your tongue.
5118	
5119	EMILIA	I will not charm my tongue; I am bound to speak:
5120	My mistress here lies murder'd in her bed,--
5121	
5122	All	O heavens forfend!
5123	
5124	EMILIA	And your reports have set the murder on.
5125	
5126	OTHELLO	Nay, stare not, masters: it is true, indeed.
5127	
5128	GRATIANO	'Tis a strange truth.
5129	
5130	MONTANO	O monstrous act!
5131	
5132	EMILIA	                  Villany, villany, villany!
5133	I think upon't, I think: I smell't: O villany!--
5134	I thought so then:--I'll kill myself for grief:--
5135	O villany, villany!
5136	
5137	IAGO	What, are you mad? I charge you, get you home.
5138	
5139	EMILIA	Good gentlemen, let me have leave to speak:
5140	
5141	'Tis proper I obey him, but not now.
5142	Perchance, Iago, I will ne'er go home.
5143	
5144	OTHELLO	O! O! O!
5145	
5146	[He falls on the bed]
5147	
5148	EMILIA	       Nay, lay thee down and roar;
5149	For thou hast kill'd the sweetest innocent
5150	That e'er did lift up eye.
5151	
5152	OTHELLO	[Rising]  O, she was foul!
5153	I scarce did know you, uncle: there lies your niece,
5154	Whose breath, indeed, these hands have newly stopp'd:
5155	I know this act shows horrible and grim.
5156	
5157	GRATIANO	Poor Desdemona! I am glad thy father's dead:
5158	Thy match was mortal to him, and pure grief
5159	Shore his old thread in twain: did he live now,
5160	This sight would make him do a desperate turn,
5161	Yea, curse his better angel from his side,
5162	And fall to reprobation.
5163	
5164	OTHELLO	'Tis pitiful; but yet Iago knows
5165	That she with Cassio hath the act of shame
5166	A thousand times committed; Cassio confess'd it:
5167	And she did gratify his amorous works
5168	With that recognizance and pledge of love
5169	Which I first gave her; I saw it in his hand:
5170	It was a handkerchief, an antique token
5171	My father gave my mother.
5172	
5173	EMILIA	O heaven! O heavenly powers!
5174	
5175	IAGO	Come, hold your peace.
5176	
5177	EMILIA	'Twill out, 'twill out: I peace!
5178	No, I will speak as liberal as the north:
5179	Let heaven and men and devils, let them all,
5180	All, all, cry shame against me, yet I'll speak.
5181	
5182	IAGO	Be wise, and get you home.
5183	
5184	EMILIA	I will not.
5185	
5186	[IAGO offers to stab EMILIA]
5187	
5188	GRATIANO	Fie!
5189	Your sword upon a woman?
5190	
5191	EMILIA	O thou dull Moor! that handkerchief thou speak'st of
5192	I found by fortune and did give my husband;
5193	For often, with a solemn earnestness,
5194	More than indeed belong'd to such a trifle,
5195	He begg'd of me to steal it.
5196	
5197	IAGO	Villanous whore!
5198	
5199	EMILIA	She give it Cassio! no, alas! I found it,
5200	And I did give't my husband.
5201	
5202	IAGO	Filth, thou liest!
5203	
5204	EMILIA	By heaven, I do not, I do not, gentlemen.
5205	O murderous coxcomb! what should such a fool
5206	Do with so good a woman?
5207	
5208	OTHELLO	Are there no stones in heaven
5209	But what serve for the thunder?--Precious villain!
5210	
5211	[He runs at IAGO  IAGO, from behind, stabs EMILIA, and exit]
5212	
5213	GRATIANO	The woman falls; sure, he hath kill'd his wife.
5214	
5215	EMILIA	Ay, ay: O, lay me by my mistress' side.
5216	
5217	GRATIANO	He's gone, but his wife's kill'd.
5218	
5219	MONTANO	'Tis a notorious villain. Take you this weapon,
5220	Which I have here recover'd from the Moor:
5221	Come, guard the door without; let him not pass,
5222	But kill him rather. I'll after that same villain,
5223	For 'tis a damned slave.
5224	
5225	[Exeunt MONTANO and GRATIANO]
5226	
5227	OTHELLO	I am not valiant neither,
5228	But ever puny whipster gets my sword:
5229	But why should honour outlive honesty?
5230	Let it go all.
5231	
5232	EMILIA	What did thy song bode, lady?
5233	Hark, canst thou hear me? I will play the swan.
5234	And die in music.
5235	
5236	[Singing]
5237	
5238	Willow, willow, willow,--
5239	Moor, she was chaste; she loved thee, cruel Moor;
5240	So come my soul to bliss, as I speak true;
5241	So speaking as I think, I die, I die.
5242	
5243	[Dies]
5244	
5245	OTHELLO	I have another weapon in this chamber;
5246	It is a sword of Spain, the ice-brook's temper:--
5247	O, here it is. Uncle, I must come forth.
5248	
5249	GRATIANO	[Within]  If thou attempt it, it will cost thee dear:
5250	Thou hast no weapon, and perforce must suffer.
5251	
5252	OTHELLO	Look in upon me then and speak with me,
5253	Or, naked as I am, I will assault thee.
5254	
5255	[Re-enter GRATIANO]
5256	
5257	GRATIANO	What is the matter?
5258	
5259	OTHELLO	Behold, I have a weapon;
5260	A better never did itself sustain
5261	Upon a soldier's thigh: I have seen the day,
5262	That, with this little arm and this good sword,
5263	I have made my way through more impediments
5264	Than twenty times your stop: but, O vain boast!
5265	Who can control his fate? 'tis not so now.
5266	Be not afraid, though you do see me weapon'd;
5267	Here is my journey's end, here is my butt,
5268	And very sea-mark of my utmost sail.
5269	Do you go back dismay'd? 'tis a lost fear;
5270	Man but a rush against Othello's breast,
5271	And he retires. Where should Othello go?
5272	Now, how dost thou look now? O ill-starr'd wench!
5273	Pale as thy smock! when we shall meet at compt,
5274	This look of thine will hurl my soul from heaven,
5275	And fiends will snatch at it. Cold, cold, my girl!
5276	Even like thy chastity. O cursed slave!
5277	Whip me, ye devils,
5278	From the possession of this heavenly sight!
5279	Blow me about in winds! roast me in sulphur!
5280	Wash me in steep-down gulfs of liquid fire!
5281	O Desdemona! Desdemona! dead!
5282	Oh! Oh! Oh!
5283	
5284	[Enter LODOVICO. MONTANO, CASSIO carried in a chair,
5285	and Officers with IAGO, prisoner]
5286	
5287	LODOVICO	Where is this rash and most unfortunate man?
5288	
5289	OTHELLO	That's he that was Othello: here I am.
5290	
5291	LODOVICO	Where is that viper? bring the villain forth.
5292	
5293	OTHELLO	I look down towards his feet; but that's a fable.
5294	If that thou best a devil, I cannot kill thee.
5295	
5296	[Wounds IAGO]
5297	
5298	LODOVICO	Wrench his sword from him.
5299	
5300	IAGO	I bleed, sir; but not kill'd.
5301	
5302	OTHELLO	I am not sorry neither: I'ld have thee live;
5303	For, in my sense, 'tis happiness to die.
5304	
5305	LODOVICO	O thou Othello, thou wert once so good,
5306	Fall'n in the practise of a damned slave,
5307	What shall be said to thee?
5308	
5309	OTHELLO	Why, any thing:
5310	An honourable murderer, if you will;
5311	For nought I did in hate, but all in honour.
5312	
5313	LODOVICO	This wretch hath part confess'd his villany:
5314	Did you and he consent in Cassio's death?
5315	
5316	OTHELLO	Ay.
5317	
5318	CASSIO	Dear general, I never gave you cause.
5319	
5320	OTHELLO	I do believe it, and I ask your pardon.
5321	Will you, I pray, demand that demi-devil
5322	Why he hath thus ensnared my soul and body?
5323	
5324	IAGO	Demand me nothing: what you know, you know:
5325	From this time forth I never will speak word.
5326	
5327	LODOVICO	What, not to pray?
5328	
5329	GRATIANO	                  Torments will ope your lips.
5330	
5331	OTHELLO	Well, thou dost best.
5332	
5333	LODOVICO	Sir, you shall understand what hath befall'n,
5334	Which, as I think, you know not. Here is a letter
5335	Found in the pocket of the slain Roderigo;
5336	And here another: the one of them imports
5337	The death of Cassio to be undertook
5338	By Roderigo.
5339	
5340	OTHELLO	O villain!
5341	
5342	CASSIO	Most heathenish and most gross!
5343	
5344	LODOVICO	Now here's another discontented paper,
5345	Found in his pocket too; and this, it seems,
5346	Roderigo meant to have sent this damned villain;
5347	But that belike Iago in the interim
5348	Came in and satisfied him.
5349	
5350	OTHELLO	O the pernicious caitiff!
5351	How came you, Cassio, by that handkerchief
5352	That was my wife's?
5353	
5354	CASSIO	I found it in my chamber:
5355	And he himself confess'd but even now
5356	That there he dropp'd it for a special purpose
5357	Which wrought to his desire.
5358	
5359	OTHELLO	O fool! fool! fool!
5360	
5361	CASSIO	There is besides in Roderigo's letter,
5362	How he upbraids Iago, that he made him
5363	Brave me upon the watch; whereon it came
5364	That I was cast: and even but now he spake,
5365	After long seeming dead, Iago hurt him,
5366	Iago set him on.
5367	
5368	LODOVICO	You must forsake this room, and go with us:
5369	Your power and your command is taken off,
5370	And Cassio rules in Cyprus. For this slave,
5371	If there be any cunning cruelty
5372	That can torment him much and hold him long,
5373	It shall be his. You shall close prisoner rest,
5374	Till that the nature of your fault be known
5375	To the Venetian state. Come, bring him away.
5376	
5377	OTHELLO	Soft you; a word or two before you go.
5378	I have done the state some service, and they know't.
5379	No more of that. I pray you, in your letters,
5380	When you shall these unlucky deeds relate,
5381	Speak of me as I am; nothing extenuate,
5382	Nor set down aught in malice: then must you speak
5383	Of one that loved not wisely but too well;
5384	Of one not easily jealous, but being wrought
5385	Perplex'd in the extreme; of one whose hand,
5386	Like the base Indian, threw a pearl away
5387	Richer than all his tribe; of one whose subdued eyes,
5388	Albeit unused to the melting mood,
5389	Drop tears as fast as the Arabian trees
5390	Their medicinal gum. Set you down this;
5391	And say besides, that in Aleppo once,
5392	Where a malignant and a turban'd Turk
5393	Beat a Venetian and traduced the state,
5394	I took by the throat the circumcised dog,
5395	And smote him, thus.
5396	
5397	[Stabs himself]
5398	
5399	LODOVICO	O bloody period!
5400	
5401	GRATIANO	                  All that's spoke is marr'd.
5402	
5403	OTHELLO	I kiss'd thee ere I kill'd thee: no way but this;
5404	Killing myself, to die upon a kiss.
5405	
5406	[Falls on the bed, and dies]
5407	
5408	CASSIO	This did I fear, but thought he had no weapon;
5409	For he was great of heart.
5410	
5411	LODOVICO	[To IAGO]  O Spartan dog,
5412	More fell than anguish, hunger, or the sea!
5413	Look on the tragic loading of this bed;
5414	This is thy work: the object poisons sight;
5415	Let it be hid. Gratiano, keep the house,
5416	And seize upon the fortunes of the Moor,
5417	For they succeed on you. To you, lord governor,
5418	Remains the censure of this hellish villain;
5419	The time, the place, the torture: O, enforce it!
5420	Myself will straight aboard: and to the state
5421	This heavy act with heavy heart relate.
5422	
5423	[Exeunt]

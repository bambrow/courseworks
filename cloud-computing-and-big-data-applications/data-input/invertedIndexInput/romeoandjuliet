81	PROLOGUE
82	
83	
84	Two households, both alike in dignity,
85	In fair Verona, where we lay our scene,
86	From ancient grudge break to new mutiny,
87	Where civil blood makes civil hands unclean.
88	From forth the fatal loins of these two foes
89	A pair of star-cross'd lovers take their life;
90	Whole misadventured piteous overthrows
91	Do with their death bury their parents' strife.
92	The fearful passage of their death-mark'd love,
93	And the continuance of their parents' rage,
94	Which, but their children's end, nought could remove,
95	Is now the two hours' traffic of our stage;
96	The which if you with patient ears attend,
97	What here shall miss, our toil shall strive to mend.

105	ACT I
106	
107	
108	
109	SCENE I	Verona. A public place.
110	
111	
112	[Enter SAMPSON and GREGORY, of the house of Capulet,
113	armed with swords and bucklers]
114	
115	SAMPSON	Gregory, o' my word, we'll not carry coals.
116	
117	GREGORY	No, for then we should be colliers.
118	
119	SAMPSON	I mean, an we be in choler, we'll draw.
120	
121	GREGORY	Ay, while you live, draw your neck out o' the collar.
122	
123	SAMPSON	I strike quickly, being moved.
124	
125	GREGORY	But thou art not quickly moved to strike.
126	
127	SAMPSON	A dog of the house of Montague moves me.
128	
129	GREGORY	To move is to stir; and to be valiant is to stand:
130	therefore, if thou art moved, thou runn'st away.
131	
132	SAMPSON	A dog of that house shall move me to stand: I will
133	take the wall of any man or maid of Montague's.
134	
135	GREGORY	That shows thee a weak slave; for the weakest goes
136	to the wall.
137	
138	SAMPSON	True; and therefore women, being the weaker vessels,
139	are ever thrust to the wall: therefore I will push
140	Montague's men from the wall, and thrust his maids
141	to the wall.
142	
143	GREGORY	The quarrel is between our masters and us their men.
144	
145	SAMPSON	'Tis all one, I will show myself a tyrant: when I
146	have fought with the men, I will be cruel with the
147	maids, and cut off their heads.
148	
149	GREGORY	The heads of the maids?
150	
151	SAMPSON	Ay, the heads of the maids, or their maidenheads;
152	take it in what sense thou wilt.
153	
154	GREGORY	They must take it in sense that feel it.
155	
156	SAMPSON	Me they shall feel while I am able to stand: and
157	'tis known I am a pretty piece of flesh.
158	
159	GREGORY	'Tis well thou art not fish; if thou hadst, thou
160	hadst been poor John. Draw thy tool! here comes
161	two of the house of the Montagues.
162	
163	SAMPSON	My naked weapon is out: quarrel, I will back thee.
164	
165	GREGORY	How! turn thy back and run?
166	
167	SAMPSON	Fear me not.
168	
169	GREGORY	No, marry; I fear thee!
170	
171	SAMPSON	Let us take the law of our sides; let them begin.
172	
173	GREGORY	I will frown as I pass by, and let them take it as
174	they list.
175	
176	SAMPSON	Nay, as they dare. I will bite my thumb at them;
177	which is a disgrace to them, if they bear it.
178	
179	[Enter ABRAHAM and BALTHASAR]
180	
181	ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
182	
183	SAMPSON	I do bite my thumb, sir.
184	
185	ABRAHAM	Do you bite your thumb at us, sir?
186	
187	SAMPSON	[Aside to GREGORY]  Is the law of our side, if I say
188	ay?
189	
190	GREGORY	No.
191	
192	SAMPSON	No, sir, I do not bite my thumb at you, sir, but I
193	bite my thumb, sir.
194	
195	GREGORY	Do you quarrel, sir?
196	
197	ABRAHAM	Quarrel sir! no, sir.
198	
199	SAMPSON	If you do, sir, I am for you: I serve as good a man as you.
200	
201	ABRAHAM	No better.
202	
203	SAMPSON	Well, sir.
204	
205	GREGORY	Say 'better:' here comes one of my master's kinsmen.
206	
207	SAMPSON	Yes, better, sir.
208	
209	ABRAHAM	You lie.
210	
211	SAMPSON	Draw, if you be men. Gregory, remember thy swashing blow.
212	
213	[They fight]
214	
215	[Enter BENVOLIO]
216	
217	BENVOLIO	Part, fools!
218	Put up your swords; you know not what you do.
219	
220	[Beats down their swords]
221	
222	[Enter TYBALT]
223	
224	TYBALT	What, art thou drawn among these heartless hinds?
225	Turn thee, Benvolio, look upon thy death.
226	
227	BENVOLIO	I do but keep the peace: put up thy sword,
228	Or manage it to part these men with me.
229	
230	TYBALT	What, drawn, and talk of peace! I hate the word,
231	As I hate hell, all Montagues, and thee:
232	Have at thee, coward!
233	
234	[They fight]
235	
236	[Enter, several of both houses, who join the fray;
237	then enter Citizens, with clubs]
238	
239	First Citizen	Clubs, bills, and partisans! strike! beat them down!
240	Down with the Capulets! down with the Montagues!
241	
242	[Enter CAPULET in his gown, and LADY CAPULET]
243	
244	CAPULET	What noise is this? Give me my long sword, ho!
245	
246	LADY CAPULET	A crutch, a crutch! why call you for a sword?
247	
248	CAPULET	My sword, I say! Old Montague is come,
249	And flourishes his blade in spite of me.
250	
251	[Enter MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
252	
253	MONTAGUE	Thou villain Capulet,--Hold me not, let me go.
254	
255	LADY MONTAGUE	Thou shalt not stir a foot to seek a foe.
256	
257	[Enter PRINCE, with Attendants]
258	
259	PRINCE	Rebellious subjects, enemies to peace,
260	Profaners of this neighbour-stained steel,--
261	Will they not hear? What, ho! you men, you beasts,
262	That quench the fire of your pernicious rage
263	With purple fountains issuing from your veins,
264	On pain of torture, from those bloody hands
265	Throw your mistemper'd weapons to the ground,
266	And hear the sentence of your moved prince.
267	Three civil brawls, bred of an airy word,
268	By thee, old Capulet, and Montague,
269	Have thrice disturb'd the quiet of our streets,
270	And made Verona's ancient citizens
271	Cast by their grave beseeming ornaments,
272	To wield old partisans, in hands as old,
273	Canker'd with peace, to part your canker'd hate:
274	If ever you disturb our streets again,
275	Your lives shall pay the forfeit of the peace.
276	For this time, all the rest depart away:
277	You Capulet; shall go along with me:
278	And, Montague, come you this afternoon,
279	To know our further pleasure in this case,
280	To old Free-town, our common judgment-place.
281	Once more, on pain of death, all men depart.
282	
283	[Exeunt all but MONTAGUE, LADY MONTAGUE, and BENVOLIO]
284	
285	MONTAGUE	Who set this ancient quarrel new abroach?
286	Speak, nephew, were you by when it began?
287	
288	BENVOLIO	Here were the servants of your adversary,
289	And yours, close fighting ere I did approach:
290	I drew to part them: in the instant came
291	The fiery Tybalt, with his sword prepared,
292	Which, as he breathed defiance to my ears,
293	He swung about his head and cut the winds,
294	Who nothing hurt withal hiss'd him in scorn:
295	While we were interchanging thrusts and blows,
296	Came more and more and fought on part and part,
297	Till the prince came, who parted either part.
298	
299	LADY MONTAGUE	O, where is Romeo? saw you him to-day?
300	Right glad I am he was not at this fray.
301	
302	BENVOLIO	Madam, an hour before the worshipp'd sun
303	Peer'd forth the golden window of the east,
304	A troubled mind drave me to walk abroad;
305	Where, underneath the grove of sycamore
306	That westward rooteth from the city's side,
307	So early walking did I see your son:
308	Towards him I made, but he was ware of me
309	And stole into the covert of the wood:
310	I, measuring his affections by my own,
311	That most are busied when they're most alone,
312	Pursued my humour not pursuing his,
313	And gladly shunn'd who gladly fled from me.
314	
315	MONTAGUE	Many a morning hath he there been seen,
316	With tears augmenting the fresh morning dew.
317	Adding to clouds more clouds with his deep sighs;
318	But all so soon as the all-cheering sun
319	Should in the furthest east begin to draw
320	The shady curtains from Aurora's bed,
321	Away from the light steals home my heavy son,
322	And private in his chamber pens himself,
323	Shuts up his windows, locks far daylight out
324	And makes himself an artificial night:
325	Black and portentous must this humour prove,
326	Unless good counsel may the cause remove.
327	
328	BENVOLIO	My noble uncle, do you know the cause?
329	
330	MONTAGUE	I neither know it nor can learn of him.
331	
332	BENVOLIO	Have you importuned him by any means?
333	
334	MONTAGUE	Both by myself and many other friends:
335	But he, his own affections' counsellor,
336	Is to himself--I will not say how true--
337	But to himself so secret and so close,
338	So far from sounding and discovery,
339	As is the bud bit with an envious worm,
340	Ere he can spread his sweet leaves to the air,
341	Or dedicate his beauty to the sun.
342	Could we but learn from whence his sorrows grow.
343	We would as willingly give cure as know.
344	
345	[Enter ROMEO]
346	
347	BENVOLIO	See, where he comes: so please you, step aside;
348	I'll know his grievance, or be much denied.
349	
350	MONTAGUE	I would thou wert so happy by thy stay,
351	To hear true shrift. Come, madam, let's away.
352	
353	[Exeunt MONTAGUE and LADY MONTAGUE]
354	
355	BENVOLIO	Good-morrow, cousin.
356	
357	ROMEO	Is the day so young?
358	
359	BENVOLIO	But new struck nine.
360	
361	ROMEO	Ay me! sad hours seem long.
362	Was that my father that went hence so fast?
363	
364	BENVOLIO	It was. What sadness lengthens Romeo's hours?
365	
366	ROMEO	Not having that, which, having, makes them short.
367	
368	BENVOLIO	In love?
369	
370	ROMEO	Out--
371	
372	BENVOLIO	Of love?
373	
374	ROMEO	Out of her favour, where I am in love.
375	
376	BENVOLIO	Alas, that love, so gentle in his view,
377	Should be so tyrannous and rough in proof!
378	
379	ROMEO	Alas, that love, whose view is muffled still,
380	Should, without eyes, see pathways to his will!
381	Where shall we dine? O me! What fray was here?
382	Yet tell me not, for I have heard it all.
383	Here's much to do with hate, but more with love.
384	Why, then, O brawling love! O loving hate!
385	O any thing, of nothing first create!
386	O heavy lightness! serious vanity!
387	Mis-shapen chaos of well-seeming forms!
388	Feather of lead, bright smoke, cold fire,
389	sick health!
390	Still-waking sleep, that is not what it is!
391	This love feel I, that feel no love in this.
392	Dost thou not laugh?
393	
394	BENVOLIO	No, coz, I rather weep.
395	
396	ROMEO	Good heart, at what?
397	
398	BENVOLIO	At thy good heart's oppression.
399	
400	ROMEO	Why, such is love's transgression.
401	Griefs of mine own lie heavy in my breast,
402	Which thou wilt propagate, to have it prest
403	With more of thine: this love that thou hast shown
404	Doth add more grief to too much of mine own.
405	Love is a smoke raised with the fume of sighs;
406	Being purged, a fire sparkling in lovers' eyes;
407	Being vex'd a sea nourish'd with lovers' tears:
408	What is it else? a madness most discreet,
409	A choking gall and a preserving sweet.
410	Farewell, my coz.
411	
412	BENVOLIO	                  Soft! I will go along;
413	An if you leave me so, you do me wrong.
414	
415	ROMEO	Tut, I have lost myself; I am not here;
416	This is not Romeo, he's some other where.
417	
418	BENVOLIO	Tell me in sadness, who is that you love.
419	
420	ROMEO	What, shall I groan and tell thee?
421	
422	BENVOLIO	Groan! why, no.
423	But sadly tell me who.
424	
425	ROMEO	Bid a sick man in sadness make his will:
426	Ah, word ill urged to one that is so ill!
427	In sadness, cousin, I do love a woman.
428	
429	BENVOLIO	I aim'd so near, when I supposed you loved.
430	
431	ROMEO	A right good mark-man! And she's fair I love.
432	
433	BENVOLIO	A right fair mark, fair coz, is soonest hit.
434	
435	ROMEO	Well, in that hit you miss: she'll not be hit
436	With Cupid's arrow; she hath Dian's wit;
437	And, in strong proof of chastity well arm'd,
438	From love's weak childish bow she lives unharm'd.
439	She will not stay the siege of loving terms,
440	Nor bide the encounter of assailing eyes,
441	Nor ope her lap to saint-seducing gold:
442	O, she is rich in beauty, only poor,
443	That when she dies with beauty dies her store.
444	
445	BENVOLIO	Then she hath sworn that she will still live chaste?
446	
447	ROMEO	She hath, and in that sparing makes huge waste,
448	For beauty starved with her severity
449	Cuts beauty off from all posterity.
450	She is too fair, too wise, wisely too fair,
451	To merit bliss by making me despair:
452	She hath forsworn to love, and in that vow
453	Do I live dead that live to tell it now.
454	
455	BENVOLIO	Be ruled by me, forget to think of her.
456	
457	ROMEO	O, teach me how I should forget to think.
458	
459	BENVOLIO	By giving liberty unto thine eyes;
460	Examine other beauties.
461	
462	ROMEO	'Tis the way
463	To call hers exquisite, in question more:
464	These happy masks that kiss fair ladies' brows
465	Being black put us in mind they hide the fair;
466	He that is strucken blind cannot forget
467	The precious treasure of his eyesight lost:
468	Show me a mistress that is passing fair,
469	What doth her beauty serve, but as a note
470	Where I may read who pass'd that passing fair?
471	Farewell: thou canst not teach me to forget.
472	
473	BENVOLIO	I'll pay that doctrine, or else die in debt.
474	
475	[Exeunt]

483	ACT I
484	
485	
486	
487	SCENE II	A street.
488	
489	
490	[Enter CAPULET, PARIS, and Servant]
491	
492	CAPULET	But Montague is bound as well as I,
493	In penalty alike; and 'tis not hard, I think,
494	For men so old as we to keep the peace.
495	
496	PARIS	Of honourable reckoning are you both;
497	And pity 'tis you lived at odds so long.
498	But now, my lord, what say you to my suit?
499	
500	CAPULET	But saying o'er what I have said before:
501	My child is yet a stranger in the world;
502	She hath not seen the change of fourteen years,
503	Let two more summers wither in their pride,
504	Ere we may think her ripe to be a bride.
505	
506	PARIS	Younger than she are happy mothers made.
507	
508	CAPULET	And too soon marr'd are those so early made.
509	The earth hath swallow'd all my hopes but she,
510	She is the hopeful lady of my earth:
511	But woo her, gentle Paris, get her heart,
512	My will to her consent is but a part;
513	An she agree, within her scope of choice
514	Lies my consent and fair according voice.
515	This night I hold an old accustom'd feast,
516	Whereto I have invited many a guest,
517	Such as I love; and you, among the store,
518	One more, most welcome, makes my number more.
519	At my poor house look to behold this night
520	Earth-treading stars that make dark heaven light:
521	Such comfort as do lusty young men feel
522	When well-apparell'd April on the heel
523	Of limping winter treads, even such delight
524	Among fresh female buds shall you this night
525	Inherit at my house; hear all, all see,
526	And like her most whose merit most shall be:
527	Which on more view, of many mine being one
528	May stand in number, though in reckoning none,
529	Come, go with me.
530	
531	[To Servant, giving a paper]
532	
533	Go, sirrah, trudge about
534	Through fair Verona; find those persons out
535	Whose names are written there, and to them say,
536	My house and welcome on their pleasure stay.
537	
538	[Exeunt CAPULET and PARIS]
539	
540	Servant	Find them out whose names are written here! It is
541	written, that the shoemaker should meddle with his
542	yard, and the tailor with his last, the fisher with
543	his pencil, and the painter with his nets; but I am
544	sent to find those persons whose names are here
545	writ, and can never find what names the writing
546	person hath here writ. I must to the learned.--In good time.
547	
548	[Enter BENVOLIO and ROMEO]
549	
550	BENVOLIO	Tut, man, one fire burns out another's burning,
551	One pain is lessen'd by another's anguish;
552	Turn giddy, and be holp by backward turning;
553	One desperate grief cures with another's languish:
554	Take thou some new infection to thy eye,
555	And the rank poison of the old will die.
556	
557	ROMEO	Your plaintain-leaf is excellent for that.
558	
559	BENVOLIO	For what, I pray thee?
560	
561	ROMEO	For your broken shin.
562	
563	BENVOLIO	Why, Romeo, art thou mad?
564	
565	ROMEO	Not mad, but bound more than a mad-man is;
566	Shut up in prison, kept without my food,
567	Whipp'd and tormented and--God-den, good fellow.
568	
569	Servant	God gi' god-den. I pray, sir, can you read?
570	
571	ROMEO	Ay, mine own fortune in my misery.
572	
573	Servant	Perhaps you have learned it without book: but, I
574	pray, can you read any thing you see?
575	
576	ROMEO	Ay, if I know the letters and the language.
577	
578	Servant	Ye say honestly: rest you merry!
579	
580	ROMEO	Stay, fellow; I can read.
581	
582	[Reads]
583	
584	'Signior Martino and his wife and daughters;
585	County Anselme and his beauteous sisters; the lady
586	widow of Vitravio; Signior Placentio and his lovely
587	nieces; Mercutio and his brother Valentine; mine
588	uncle Capulet, his wife and daughters; my fair niece
589	Rosaline; Livia; Signior Valentio and his cousin
590	Tybalt, Lucio and the lively Helena.' A fair
591	assembly: whither should they come?
592	
593	Servant	Up.
594	
595	ROMEO	Whither?
596	
597	Servant	To supper; to our house.
598	
599	ROMEO	Whose house?
600	
601	Servant	My master's.
602	
603	ROMEO	Indeed, I should have ask'd you that before.
604	
605	Servant	Now I'll tell you without asking: my master is the
606	great rich Capulet; and if you be not of the house
607	of Montagues, I pray, come and crush a cup of wine.
608	Rest you merry!
609	
610	[Exit]
611	
612	BENVOLIO	At this same ancient feast of Capulet's
613	Sups the fair Rosaline whom thou so lovest,
614	With all the admired beauties of Verona:
615	Go thither; and, with unattainted eye,
616	Compare her face with some that I shall show,
617	And I will make thee think thy swan a crow.
618	
619	ROMEO	When the devout religion of mine eye
620	Maintains such falsehood, then turn tears to fires;
621	And these, who often drown'd could never die,
622	Transparent heretics, be burnt for liars!
623	One fairer than my love! the all-seeing sun
624	Ne'er saw her match since first the world begun.
625	
626	BENVOLIO	Tut, you saw her fair, none else being by,
627	Herself poised with herself in either eye:
628	But in that crystal scales let there be weigh'd
629	Your lady's love against some other maid
630	That I will show you shining at this feast,
631	And she shall scant show well that now shows best.
632	
633	ROMEO	I'll go along, no such sight to be shown,
634	But to rejoice in splendor of mine own.
635

648	SCENE III	A room in Capulet's house.
649	
650	
651	[Enter LADY CAPULET and Nurse]
652	
653	LADY CAPULET	Nurse, where's my daughter? call her forth to me.
654	
655	Nurse	Now, by my maidenhead, at twelve year old,
656	I bade her come. What, lamb! what, ladybird!
657	God forbid! Where's this girl? What, Juliet!
658	
659	[Enter JULIET]
660	
661	JULIET	How now! who calls?
662	
663	Nurse	Your mother.
664	
665	JULIET	Madam, I am here.
666	What is your will?
667	
668	LADY CAPULET	This is the matter:--Nurse, give leave awhile,
669	We must talk in secret:--nurse, come back again;
670	I have remember'd me, thou's hear our counsel.
671	Thou know'st my daughter's of a pretty age.
672	
673	Nurse	Faith, I can tell her age unto an hour.
674	
675	LADY CAPULET	She's not fourteen.
676	
677	Nurse	I'll lay fourteen of my teeth,--
678	And yet, to my teeth be it spoken, I have but four--
679	She is not fourteen. How long is it now
680	To Lammas-tide?
681	
682	LADY CAPULET	                  A fortnight and odd days.
683	
684	Nurse	Even or odd, of all days in the year,
685	Come Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen.
686	Susan and she--God rest all Christian souls!--
687	Were of an age: well, Susan is with God;
688	She was too good for me: but, as I said,
689	On Lammas-eve at night shall she be fourteen;
690	That shall she, marry; I remember it well.
691	'Tis since the earthquake now eleven years;
692	And she was wean'd,--I never shall forget it,--
693	Of all the days of the year, upon that day:
694	For I had then laid wormwood to my dug,
695	Sitting in the sun under the dove-house wall;
696	My lord and you were then at Mantua:--
697	Nay, I do bear a brain:--but, as I said,
698	When it did taste the wormwood on the nipple
699	Of my dug and felt it bitter, pretty fool,
700	To see it tetchy and fall out with the dug!
701	Shake quoth the dove-house: 'twas no need, I trow,
702	To bid me trudge:
703	And since that time it is eleven years;
704	For then she could stand alone; nay, by the rood,
705	She could have run and waddled all about;
706	For even the day before, she broke her brow:
707	And then my husband--God be with his soul!
708	A' was a merry man--took up the child:
709	'Yea,' quoth he, 'dost thou fall upon thy face?
710	Thou wilt fall backward when thou hast more wit;
711	Wilt thou not, Jule?' and, by my holidame,
712	The pretty wretch left crying and said 'Ay.'
713	To see, now, how a jest shall come about!
714	I warrant, an I should live a thousand years,
715	I never should forget it: 'Wilt thou not, Jule?' quoth he;
716	And, pretty fool, it stinted and said 'Ay.'
717	
718	LADY CAPULET	Enough of this; I pray thee, hold thy peace.
719	
720	Nurse	Yes, madam: yet I cannot choose but laugh,
721	To think it should leave crying and say 'Ay.'
722	And yet, I warrant, it had upon its brow
723	A bump as big as a young cockerel's stone;
724	A parlous knock; and it cried bitterly:
725	'Yea,' quoth my husband,'fall'st upon thy face?
726	Thou wilt fall backward when thou comest to age;
727	Wilt thou not, Jule?' it stinted and said 'Ay.'
728	
729	JULIET	And stint thou too, I pray thee, nurse, say I.
730	
731	Nurse	Peace, I have done. God mark thee to his grace!
732	Thou wast the prettiest babe that e'er I nursed:
733	An I might live to see thee married once,
734	I have my wish.
735	
736	LADY CAPULET	Marry, that 'marry' is the very theme
737	I came to talk of. Tell me, daughter Juliet,
738	How stands your disposition to be married?
739	
740	JULIET	It is an honour that I dream not of.
741	
742	Nurse	An honour! were not I thine only nurse,
743	I would say thou hadst suck'd wisdom from thy teat.
744	
745	LADY CAPULET	Well, think of marriage now; younger than you,
746	Here in Verona, ladies of esteem,
747	Are made already mothers: by my count,
748	I was your mother much upon these years
749	That you are now a maid. Thus then in brief:
750	The valiant Paris seeks you for his love.
751	
752	Nurse	A man, young lady! lady, such a man
753	As all the world--why, he's a man of wax.
754	
755	LADY CAPULET	Verona's summer hath not such a flower.
756	
757	Nurse	Nay, he's a flower; in faith, a very flower.
758	
759	LADY CAPULET	What say you? can you love the gentleman?
760	This night you shall behold him at our feast;
761	Read o'er the volume of young Paris' face,
762	And find delight writ there with beauty's pen;
763	Examine every married lineament,
764	And see how one another lends content
765	And what obscured in this fair volume lies
766	Find written in the margent of his eyes.
767	This precious book of love, this unbound lover,
768	To beautify him, only lacks a cover:
769	The fish lives in the sea, and 'tis much pride
770	For fair without the fair within to hide:
771	That book in many's eyes doth share the glory,
772	That in gold clasps locks in the golden story;
773	So shall you share all that he doth possess,
774	By having him, making yourself no less.
775	
776	Nurse	No less! nay, bigger; women grow by men.
777	
778	LADY CAPULET	Speak briefly, can you like of Paris' love?
779	
780	JULIET	I'll look to like, if looking liking move:
781	But no more deep will I endart mine eye
782	Than your consent gives strength to make it fly.
783	
784	[Enter a Servant]
785	
786	Servant	Madam, the guests are come, supper served up, you
787	called, my young lady asked for, the nurse cursed in
788	the pantry, and every thing in extremity. I must
789	hence to wait; I beseech you, follow straight.
790	
791	LADY CAPULET	We follow thee.
792	
793	[Exit Servant]
794	
795	Juliet, the county stays.
796	
797	Nurse	Go, girl, seek happy nights to happy days.

811	SCENE IV	A street.
812	
813	
814	[Enter ROMEO, MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, with five or six
815	Maskers, Torch-bearers, and others]
816	
817	ROMEO	What, shall this speech be spoke for our excuse?
818	Or shall we on without a apology?
819	
820	BENVOLIO	The date is out of such prolixity:
821	We'll have no Cupid hoodwink'd with a scarf,
822	Bearing a Tartar's painted bow of lath,
823	Scaring the ladies like a crow-keeper;
824	Nor no without-book prologue, faintly spoke
825	After the prompter, for our entrance:
826	But let them measure us by what they will;
827	We'll measure them a measure, and be gone.
828	
829	ROMEO	Give me a torch: I am not for this ambling;
830	Being but heavy, I will bear the light.
831	
832	MERCUTIO	Nay, gentle Romeo, we must have you dance.
833	
834	ROMEO	Not I, believe me: you have dancing shoes
835	With nimble soles: I have a soul of lead
836	So stakes me to the ground I cannot move.
837	
838	MERCUTIO	You are a lover; borrow Cupid's wings,
839	And soar with them above a common bound.
840	
841	ROMEO	I am too sore enpierced with his shaft
842	To soar with his light feathers, and so bound,
843	I cannot bound a pitch above dull woe:
844	Under love's heavy burden do I sink.
845	
846	MERCUTIO	And, to sink in it, should you burden love;
847	Too great oppression for a tender thing.
848	
849	ROMEO	Is love a tender thing? it is too rough,
850	Too rude, too boisterous, and it pricks like thorn.
851	
852	MERCUTIO	If love be rough with you, be rough with love;
853	Prick love for pricking, and you beat love down.
854	Give me a case to put my visage in:
855	A visor for a visor! what care I
856	What curious eye doth quote deformities?
857	Here are the beetle brows shall blush for me.
858	
859	BENVOLIO	Come, knock and enter; and no sooner in,
860	But every man betake him to his legs.
861	
862	ROMEO	A torch for me: let wantons light of heart
863	Tickle the senseless rushes with their heels,
864	For I am proverb'd with a grandsire phrase;
865	I'll be a candle-holder, and look on.
866	The game was ne'er so fair, and I am done.
867	
868	MERCUTIO	Tut, dun's the mouse, the constable's own word:
869	If thou art dun, we'll draw thee from the mire
870	Of this sir-reverence love, wherein thou stick'st
871	Up to the ears. Come, we burn daylight, ho!
872	
873	ROMEO	Nay, that's not so.
874	
875	MERCUTIO	I mean, sir, in delay
876	We waste our lights in vain, like lamps by day.
877	Take our good meaning, for our judgment sits
878	Five times in that ere once in our five wits.
879	
880	ROMEO	And we mean well in going to this mask;
881	But 'tis no wit to go.
882	
883	MERCUTIO	Why, may one ask?
884	
885	ROMEO	I dream'd a dream to-night.
886	
887	MERCUTIO	And so did I.
888	
889	ROMEO	Well, what was yours?
890	
891	MERCUTIO	That dreamers often lie.
892	
893	ROMEO	In bed asleep, while they do dream things true.
894	
895	MERCUTIO	O, then, I see Queen Mab hath been with you.
896	She is the fairies' midwife, and she comes
897	In shape no bigger than an agate-stone
898	On the fore-finger of an alderman,
899	Drawn with a team of little atomies
900	Athwart men's noses as they lie asleep;
901	Her wagon-spokes made of long spiders' legs,
902	The cover of the wings of grasshoppers,
903	The traces of the smallest spider's web,
904	The collars of the moonshine's watery beams,
905	Her whip of cricket's bone, the lash of film,
906	Her wagoner a small grey-coated gnat,
907	Not so big as a round little worm
908	Prick'd from the lazy finger of a maid;
909	Her chariot is an empty hazel-nut
910	Made by the joiner squirrel or old grub,
911	Time out o' mind the fairies' coachmakers.
912	And in this state she gallops night by night
913	Through lovers' brains, and then they dream of love;
914	O'er courtiers' knees, that dream on court'sies straight,
915	O'er lawyers' fingers, who straight dream on fees,
916	O'er ladies ' lips, who straight on kisses dream,
917	Which oft the angry Mab with blisters plagues,
918	Because their breaths with sweetmeats tainted are:
919	Sometime she gallops o'er a courtier's nose,
920	And then dreams he of smelling out a suit;
921	And sometime comes she with a tithe-pig's tail
922	Tickling a parson's nose as a' lies asleep,
923	Then dreams, he of another benefice:
924	Sometime she driveth o'er a soldier's neck,
925	And then dreams he of cutting foreign throats,
926	Of breaches, ambuscadoes, Spanish blades,
927	Of healths five-fathom deep; and then anon
928	Drums in his ear, at which he starts and wakes,
929	And being thus frighted swears a prayer or two
930	And sleeps again. This is that very Mab
931	That plats the manes of horses in the night,
932	And bakes the elflocks in foul sluttish hairs,
933	Which once untangled, much misfortune bodes:
934	This is the hag, when maids lie on their backs,
935	That presses them and learns them first to bear,
936	Making them women of good carriage:
937	This is she--
938	
939	ROMEO	                  Peace, peace, Mercutio, peace!
940	Thou talk'st of nothing.
941	
942	MERCUTIO	True, I talk of dreams,
943	Which are the children of an idle brain,
944	Begot of nothing but vain fantasy,
945	Which is as thin of substance as the air
946	And more inconstant than the wind, who wooes
947	Even now the frozen bosom of the north,
948	And, being anger'd, puffs away from thence,
949	Turning his face to the dew-dropping south.
950	
951	BENVOLIO	This wind, you talk of, blows us from ourselves;
952	Supper is done, and we shall come too late.
953	
954	ROMEO	I fear, too early: for my mind misgives
955	Some consequence yet hanging in the stars
956	Shall bitterly begin his fearful date
957	With this night's revels and expire the term
958	Of a despised life closed in my breast
959	By some vile forfeit of untimely death.
960	But He, that hath the steerage of my course,
961	Direct my sail! On, lusty gentlemen.
962	
963	BENVOLIO	Strike, drum.

981	
982	First Servant	Where's Potpan, that he helps not to take away? He
983	shift a trencher? he scrape a trencher!
984	
985	Second Servant	When good manners shall lie all in one or two men's
986	hands and they unwashed too, 'tis a foul thing.
987	
988	First Servant	Away with the joint-stools, remove the
989	court-cupboard, look to the plate. Good thou, save
990	me a piece of marchpane; and, as thou lovest me, let
991	the porter let in Susan Grindstone and Nell.
992	Antony, and Potpan!
993	
994	Second Servant	Ay, boy, ready.
995	
996	First Servant	You are looked for and called for, asked for and
997	sought for, in the great chamber.
998	
999	Second Servant	We cannot be here and there too. Cheerly, boys; be
1000	brisk awhile, and the longer liver take all.
1001	
1002	[Enter CAPULET, with JULIET and others of his house,
1003	meeting the Guests and Maskers]
1004	
1005	CAPULET	Welcome, gentlemen! ladies that have their toes
1006	Unplagued with corns will have a bout with you.
1007	Ah ha, my mistresses! which of you all
1008	Will now deny to dance? she that makes dainty,
1009	She, I'll swear, hath corns; am I come near ye now?
1010	Welcome, gentlemen! I have seen the day
1011	That I have worn a visor and could tell
1012	A whispering tale in a fair lady's ear,
1013	Such as would please: 'tis gone, 'tis gone, 'tis gone:
1014	You are welcome, gentlemen! come, musicians, play.
1015	A hall, a hall! give room! and foot it, girls.
1016	
1017	[Music plays, and they dance]
1018	
1019	More light, you knaves; and turn the tables up,
1020	And quench the fire, the room is grown too hot.
1021	Ah, sirrah, this unlook'd-for sport comes well.
1022	Nay, sit, nay, sit, good cousin Capulet;
1023	For you and I are past our dancing days:
1024	How long is't now since last yourself and I
1025	Were in a mask?
1026	
1027	Second Capulet	                  By'r lady, thirty years.
1028	
1029	CAPULET	What, man! 'tis not so much, 'tis not so much:
1030	'Tis since the nuptials of Lucentio,
1031	Come pentecost as quickly as it will,
1032	Some five and twenty years; and then we mask'd.
1033	
1034	Second Capulet	'Tis more, 'tis more, his son is elder, sir;
1035	His son is thirty.
1036	
1037	CAPULET	                  Will you tell me that?
1038	His son was but a ward two years ago.
1039	
1040	ROMEO	[To a Servingman]  What lady is that, which doth
1041	enrich the hand
1042	Of yonder knight?
1043	
1044	Servant	I know not, sir.
1045	
1046	ROMEO	O, she doth teach the torches to burn bright!
1047	It seems she hangs upon the cheek of night
1048	Like a rich jewel in an Ethiope's ear;
1049	Beauty too rich for use, for earth too dear!
1050	So shows a snowy dove trooping with crows,
1051	As yonder lady o'er her fellows shows.
1052	The measure done, I'll watch her place of stand,
1053	And, touching hers, make blessed my rude hand.
1054	Did my heart love till now? forswear it, sight!
1055	For I ne'er saw true beauty till this night.
1056	
1057	TYBALT	This, by his voice, should be a Montague.
1058	Fetch me my rapier, boy. What dares the slave
1059	Come hither, cover'd with an antic face,
1060	To fleer and scorn at our solemnity?
1061	Now, by the stock and honour of my kin,
1062	To strike him dead, I hold it not a sin.
1063	
1064	CAPULET	Why, how now, kinsman! wherefore storm you so?
1065	
1066	TYBALT	Uncle, this is a Montague, our foe,
1067	A villain that is hither come in spite,
1068	To scorn at our solemnity this night.
1069	
1070	CAPULET	Young Romeo is it?
1071	
1072	TYBALT	'Tis he, that villain Romeo.
1073	
1074	CAPULET	Content thee, gentle coz, let him alone;
1075	He bears him like a portly gentleman;
1076	And, to say truth, Verona brags of him
1077	To be a virtuous and well-govern'd youth:
1078	I would not for the wealth of all the town
1079	Here in my house do him disparagement:
1080	Therefore be patient, take no note of him:
1081	It is my will, the which if thou respect,
1082	Show a fair presence and put off these frowns,
1083	And ill-beseeming semblance for a feast.
1084	
1085	TYBALT	It fits, when such a villain is a guest:
1086	I'll not endure him.
1087	
1088	CAPULET	He shall be endured:
1089	What, goodman boy! I say, he shall: go to;
1090	Am I the master here, or you? go to.
1091	You'll not endure him! God shall mend my soul!
1092	You'll make a mutiny among my guests!
1093	You will set cock-a-hoop! you'll be the man!
1094	
1095	TYBALT	Why, uncle, 'tis a shame.
1096	
1097	CAPULET	Go to, go to;
1098	You are a saucy boy: is't so, indeed?
1099	This trick may chance to scathe you, I know what:
1100	You must contrary me! marry, 'tis time.
1101	Well said, my hearts! You are a princox; go:
1102	Be quiet, or--More light, more light! For shame!
1103	I'll make you quiet. What, cheerly, my hearts!
1104	
1105	TYBALT	Patience perforce with wilful choler meeting
1106	Makes my flesh tremble in their different greeting.
1107	I will withdraw: but this intrusion shall
1108	Now seeming sweet convert to bitter gall.
1109	
1110	[Exit]
1111	
1112	ROMEO	[To JULIET]  If I profane with my unworthiest hand
1113	This holy shrine, the gentle fine is this:
1114	My lips, two blushing pilgrims, ready stand
1115	To smooth that rough touch with a tender kiss.
1116	
1117	JULIET	Good pilgrim, you do wrong your hand too much,
1118	Which mannerly devotion shows in this;
1119	For saints have hands that pilgrims' hands do touch,
1120	And palm to palm is holy palmers' kiss.
1121	
1122	ROMEO	Have not saints lips, and holy palmers too?
1123	
1124	JULIET	Ay, pilgrim, lips that they must use in prayer.
1125	
1126	ROMEO	O, then, dear saint, let lips do what hands do;
1127	They pray, grant thou, lest faith turn to despair.
1128	
1129	JULIET	Saints do not move, though grant for prayers' sake.
1130	
1131	ROMEO	Then move not, while my prayer's effect I take.
1132	Thus from my lips, by yours, my sin is purged.
1133	
1134	JULIET	Then have my lips the sin that they have took.
1135	
1136	ROMEO	Sin from thy lips? O trespass sweetly urged!
1137	Give me my sin again.
1138	
1139	JULIET	You kiss by the book.
1140	
1141	Nurse	Madam, your mother craves a word with you.
1142	
1143	ROMEO	What is her mother?
1144	
1145	Nurse	Marry, bachelor,
1146	Her mother is the lady of the house,
1147	And a good lady, and a wise and virtuous
1148	I nursed her daughter, that you talk'd withal;
1149	I tell you, he that can lay hold of her
1150	Shall have the chinks.
1151	
1152	ROMEO	Is she a Capulet?
1153	O dear account! my life is my foe's debt.
1154	
1155	BENVOLIO	Away, begone; the sport is at the best.
1156	
1157	ROMEO	Ay, so I fear; the more is my unrest.
1158	
1159	CAPULET	Nay, gentlemen, prepare not to be gone;
1160	We have a trifling foolish banquet towards.
1161	Is it e'en so? why, then, I thank you all
1162	I thank you, honest gentlemen; good night.
1163	More torches here! Come on then, let's to bed.
1164	Ah, sirrah, by my fay, it waxes late:
1165	I'll to my rest.
1166	
1167	[Exeunt all but JULIET and Nurse]
1168	
1169	JULIET	Come hither, nurse. What is yond gentleman?
1170	
1171	Nurse	The son and heir of old Tiberio.
1172	
1173	JULIET	What's he that now is going out of door?
1174	
1175	Nurse	Marry, that, I think, be young Petrucio.
1176	
1177	JULIET	What's he that follows there, that would not dance?
1178	
1179	Nurse	I know not.
1180	
1181	JULIET	Go ask his name: if he be married.
1182	My grave is like to be my wedding bed.
1183	
1184	Nurse	His name is Romeo, and a Montague;
1185	The only son of your great enemy.
1186	
1187	JULIET	My only love sprung from my only hate!
1188	Too early seen unknown, and known too late!
1189	Prodigious birth of love it is to me,
1190	That I must love a loathed enemy.
1191	
1192	Nurse	What's this? what's this?
1193	
1194	JULIET	A rhyme I learn'd even now
1195	Of one I danced withal.
1196	
1197	[One calls within 'Juliet.']
1198	
1199	Nurse	Anon, anon!
1200	Come, let's away; the strangers all are gone.

1213	PROLOGUE
1214	
1215	
1216	[Enter Chorus]
1217	
1218	Chorus	Now old desire doth in his death-bed lie,
1219	And young affection gapes to be his heir;
1220	That fair for which love groan'd for and would die,
1221	With tender Juliet match'd, is now not fair.
1222	Now Romeo is beloved and loves again,
1223	Alike betwitched by the charm of looks,
1224	But to his foe supposed he must complain,
1225	And she steal love's sweet bait from fearful hooks:
1226	Being held a foe, he may not have access
1227	To breathe such vows as lovers use to swear;
1228	And she as much in love, her means much less
1229	To meet her new-beloved any where:
1230	But passion lends them power, time means, to meet
1231	Tempering extremities with extreme sweet.

1241	ACT II
1242	
1243	
1244	
1245	SCENE I	A lane by the wall of Capulet's orchard.
1246	
1247	
1248	[Enter ROMEO]
1249	
1250	ROMEO	Can I go forward when my heart is here?
1251	Turn back, dull earth, and find thy centre out.
1252	
1253	[He climbs the wall, and leaps down within it]
1254	
1255	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]
1256	
1257	BENVOLIO	Romeo! my cousin Romeo!
1258	
1259	MERCUTIO	He is wise;
1260	And, on my lie, hath stol'n him home to bed.
1261	
1262	BENVOLIO	He ran this way, and leap'd this orchard wall:
1263	Call, good Mercutio.
1264	
1265	MERCUTIO	Nay, I'll conjure too.
1266	Romeo! humours! madman! passion! lover!
1267	Appear thou in the likeness of a sigh:
1268	Speak but one rhyme, and I am satisfied;
1269	Cry but 'Ay me!' pronounce but 'love' and 'dove;'
1270	Speak to my gossip Venus one fair word,
1271	One nick-name for her purblind son and heir,
1272	Young Adam Cupid, he that shot so trim,
1273	When King Cophetua loved the beggar-maid!
1274	He heareth not, he stirreth not, he moveth not;
1275	The ape is dead, and I must conjure him.
1276	I conjure thee by Rosaline's bright eyes,
1277	By her high forehead and her scarlet lip,
1278	By her fine foot, straight leg and quivering thigh
1279	And the demesnes that there adjacent lie,
1280	That in thy likeness thou appear to us!
1281	
1282	BENVOLIO	And if he hear thee, thou wilt anger him.
1283	
1284	MERCUTIO	This cannot anger him: 'twould anger him
1285	To raise a spirit in his mistress' circle
1286	Of some strange nature, letting it there stand
1287	Till she had laid it and conjured it down;
1288	That were some spite: my invocation
1289	Is fair and honest, and in his mistress' name
1290	I conjure only but to raise up him.
1291	
1292	BENVOLIO	Come, he hath hid himself among these trees,
1293	To be consorted with the humorous night:
1294	Blind is his love and best befits the dark.
1295	
1296	MERCUTIO	If love be blind, love cannot hit the mark.
1297	Now will he sit under a medlar tree,
1298	And wish his mistress were that kind of fruit
1299	As maids call medlars, when they laugh alone.
1300	Romeo, that she were, O, that she were
1301	An open et caetera, thou a poperin pear!
1302	Romeo, good night: I'll to my truckle-bed;
1303	This field-bed is too cold for me to sleep:
1304	Come, shall we go?
1305	
1306	BENVOLIO	                  Go, then; for 'tis in vain
1307	To seek him here that means not to be found.

1320	
1321	SCENE II	Capulet's orchard.
1322	
1323	
1324	[Enter ROMEO]
1325	
1326	ROMEO	He jests at scars that never felt a wound.
1327	
1328	[JULIET appears above at a window]
1329	
1330	But, soft! what light through yonder window breaks?
1331	It is the east, and Juliet is the sun.
1332	Arise, fair sun, and kill the envious moon,
1333	Who is already sick and pale with grief,
1334	That thou her maid art far more fair than she:
1335	Be not her maid, since she is envious;
1336	Her vestal livery is but sick and green
1337	And none but fools do wear it; cast it off.
1338	It is my lady, O, it is my love!
1339	O, that she knew she were!
1340	She speaks yet she says nothing: what of that?
1341	Her eye discourses; I will answer it.
1342	I am too bold, 'tis not to me she speaks:
1343	Two of the fairest stars in all the heaven,
1344	Having some business, do entreat her eyes
1345	To twinkle in their spheres till they return.
1346	What if her eyes were there, they in her head?
1347	The brightness of her cheek would shame those stars,
1348	As daylight doth a lamp; her eyes in heaven
1349	Would through the airy region stream so bright
1350	That birds would sing and think it were not night.
1351	See, how she leans her cheek upon her hand!
1352	O, that I were a glove upon that hand,
1353	That I might touch that cheek!
1354	
1355	JULIET	Ay me!
1356	
1357	ROMEO	She speaks:
1358	O, speak again, bright angel! for thou art
1359	As glorious to this night, being o'er my head
1360	As is a winged messenger of heaven
1361	Unto the white-upturned wondering eyes
1362	Of mortals that fall back to gaze on him
1363	When he bestrides the lazy-pacing clouds
1364	And sails upon the bosom of the air.
1365	
1366	JULIET	O Romeo, Romeo! wherefore art thou Romeo?
1367	Deny thy father and refuse thy name;
1368	Or, if thou wilt not, be but sworn my love,
1369	And I'll no longer be a Capulet.
1370	
1371	ROMEO	[Aside]  Shall I hear more, or shall I speak at this?
1372	
1373	JULIET	'Tis but thy name that is my enemy;
1374	Thou art thyself, though not a Montague.
1375	What's Montague? it is nor hand, nor foot,
1376	Nor arm, nor face, nor any other part
1377	Belonging to a man. O, be some other name!
1378	What's in a name? that which we call a rose
1379	By any other name would smell as sweet;
1380	So Romeo would, were he not Romeo call'd,
1381	Retain that dear perfection which he owes
1382	Without that title. Romeo, doff thy name,
1383	And for that name which is no part of thee
1384	Take all myself.
1385	
1386	ROMEO	                  I take thee at thy word:
1387	Call me but love, and I'll be new baptized;
1388	Henceforth I never will be Romeo.
1389	
1390	JULIET	What man art thou that thus bescreen'd in night
1391	So stumblest on my counsel?
1392	
1393	ROMEO	By a name
1394	I know not how to tell thee who I am:
1395	My name, dear saint, is hateful to myself,
1396	Because it is an enemy to thee;
1397	Had I it written, I would tear the word.
1398	
1399	JULIET	My ears have not yet drunk a hundred words
1400	Of that tongue's utterance, yet I know the sound:
1401	Art thou not Romeo and a Montague?
1402	
1403	ROMEO	Neither, fair saint, if either thee dislike.
1404	
1405	JULIET	How camest thou hither, tell me, and wherefore?
1406	The orchard walls are high and hard to climb,
1407	And the place death, considering who thou art,
1408	If any of my kinsmen find thee here.
1409	
1410	ROMEO	With love's light wings did I o'er-perch these walls;
1411	For stony limits cannot hold love out,
1412	And what love can do that dares love attempt;
1413	Therefore thy kinsmen are no let to me.
1414	
1415	JULIET	If they do see thee, they will murder thee.
1416	
1417	ROMEO	Alack, there lies more peril in thine eye
1418	Than twenty of their swords: look thou but sweet,
1419	And I am proof against their enmity.
1420	
1421	JULIET	I would not for the world they saw thee here.
1422	
1423	ROMEO	I have night's cloak to hide me from their sight;
1424	And but thou love me, let them find me here:
1425	My life were better ended by their hate,
1426	Than death prorogued, wanting of thy love.
1427	
1428	JULIET	By whose direction found'st thou out this place?
1429	
1430	ROMEO	By love, who first did prompt me to inquire;
1431	He lent me counsel and I lent him eyes.
1432	I am no pilot; yet, wert thou as far
1433	As that vast shore wash'd with the farthest sea,
1434	I would adventure for such merchandise.
1435	
1436	JULIET	Thou know'st the mask of night is on my face,
1437	Else would a maiden blush bepaint my cheek
1438	For that which thou hast heard me speak to-night
1439	Fain would I dwell on form, fain, fain deny
1440	What I have spoke: but farewell compliment!
1441	Dost thou love me? I know thou wilt say 'Ay,'
1442	And I will take thy word: yet if thou swear'st,
1443	Thou mayst prove false; at lovers' perjuries
1444	Then say, Jove laughs. O gentle Romeo,
1445	If thou dost love, pronounce it faithfully:
1446	Or if thou think'st I am too quickly won,
1447	I'll frown and be perverse an say thee nay,
1448	So thou wilt woo; but else, not for the world.
1449	In truth, fair Montague, I am too fond,
1450	And therefore thou mayst think my 'havior light:
1451	But trust me, gentleman, I'll prove more true
1452	Than those that have more cunning to be strange.
1453	I should have been more strange, I must confess,
1454	But that thou overheard'st, ere I was ware,
1455	My true love's passion: therefore pardon me,
1456	And not impute this yielding to light love,
1457	Which the dark night hath so discovered.
1458	
1459	ROMEO	Lady, by yonder blessed moon I swear
1460	That tips with silver all these fruit-tree tops--
1461	
1462	JULIET	O, swear not by the moon, the inconstant moon,
1463	That monthly changes in her circled orb,
1464	Lest that thy love prove likewise variable.
1465	
1466	ROMEO	What shall I swear by?
1467	
1468	JULIET	Do not swear at all;
1469	Or, if thou wilt, swear by thy gracious self,
1470	Which is the god of my idolatry,
1471	And I'll believe thee.
1472	
1473	ROMEO	If my heart's dear love--
1474	
1475	JULIET	Well, do not swear: although I joy in thee,
1476	I have no joy of this contract to-night:
1477	It is too rash, too unadvised, too sudden;
1478	Too like the lightning, which doth cease to be
1479	Ere one can say 'It lightens.' Sweet, good night!
1480	This bud of love, by summer's ripening breath,
1481	May prove a beauteous flower when next we meet.
1482	Good night, good night! as sweet repose and rest
1483	Come to thy heart as that within my breast!
1484	
1485	ROMEO	O, wilt thou leave me so unsatisfied?
1486	
1487	JULIET	What satisfaction canst thou have to-night?
1488	
1489	ROMEO	The exchange of thy love's faithful vow for mine.
1490	
1491	JULIET	I gave thee mine before thou didst request it:
1492	And yet I would it were to give again.
1493	
1494	ROMEO	Wouldst thou withdraw it? for what purpose, love?
1495	
1496	JULIET	But to be frank, and give it thee again.
1497	And yet I wish but for the thing I have:
1498	My bounty is as boundless as the sea,
1499	My love as deep; the more I give to thee,
1500	The more I have, for both are infinite.
1501	
1502	[Nurse calls within]
1503	
1504	I hear some noise within; dear love, adieu!
1505	Anon, good nurse! Sweet Montague, be true.
1506	Stay but a little, I will come again.
1507	
1508	[Exit, above]
1509	
1510	ROMEO	O blessed, blessed night! I am afeard.
1511	Being in night, all this is but a dream,
1512	Too flattering-sweet to be substantial.
1513	
1514	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
1515	
1516	JULIET	Three words, dear Romeo, and good night indeed.
1517	If that thy bent of love be honourable,
1518	Thy purpose marriage, send me word to-morrow,
1519	By one that I'll procure to come to thee,
1520	Where and what time thou wilt perform the rite;
1521	And all my fortunes at thy foot I'll lay
1522	And follow thee my lord throughout the world.
1523	
1524	Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
1525	
1526	JULIET	I come, anon.--But if thou mean'st not well,
1527	I do beseech thee--
1528	
1529	Nurse	[Within]  Madam!
1530	
1531	JULIET	By and by, I come:--
1532	To cease thy suit, and leave me to my grief:
1533	To-morrow will I send.
1534	
1535	ROMEO	So thrive my soul--
1536	
1537	JULIET	A thousand times good night!
1538	
1539	[Exit, above]
1540	
1541	ROMEO	A thousand times the worse, to want thy light.
1542	Love goes toward love, as schoolboys from
1543	their books,
1544	But love from love, toward school with heavy looks.
1545	
1546	[Retiring]
1547	
1548	[Re-enter JULIET, above]
1549	
1550	JULIET	Hist! Romeo, hist! O, for a falconer's voice,
1551	To lure this tassel-gentle back again!
1552	Bondage is hoarse, and may not speak aloud;
1553	Else would I tear the cave where Echo lies,
1554	And make her airy tongue more hoarse than mine,
1555	With repetition of my Romeo's name.
1556	
1557	ROMEO	It is my soul that calls upon my name:
1558	How silver-sweet sound lovers' tongues by night,
1559	Like softest music to attending ears!
1560	
1561	JULIET	Romeo!
1562	
1563	ROMEO	     My dear?
1564	
1565	JULIET	                  At what o'clock to-morrow
1566	Shall I send to thee?
1567	
1568	ROMEO	At the hour of nine.
1569	
1570	JULIET	I will not fail: 'tis twenty years till then.
1571	I have forgot why I did call thee back.
1572	
1573	ROMEO	Let me stand here till thou remember it.
1574	
1575	JULIET	I shall forget, to have thee still stand there,
1576	Remembering how I love thy company.
1577	
1578	ROMEO	And I'll still stay, to have thee still forget,
1579	Forgetting any other home but this.
1580	
1581	JULIET	'Tis almost morning; I would have thee gone:
1582	And yet no further than a wanton's bird;
1583	Who lets it hop a little from her hand,
1584	Like a poor prisoner in his twisted gyves,
1585	And with a silk thread plucks it back again,
1586	So loving-jealous of his liberty.
1587	
1588	ROMEO	I would I were thy bird.
1589	
1590	JULIET	Sweet, so would I:
1591	Yet I should kill thee with much cherishing.
1592	Good night, good night! parting is such
1593	sweet sorrow,
1594	That I shall say good night till it be morrow.
1595	
1596	[Exit above]
1597	
1598	ROMEO	Sleep dwell upon thine eyes, peace in thy breast!
1599	Would I were sleep and peace, so sweet to rest!
1600	Hence will I to my ghostly father's cell,
1601	His help to crave, and my dear hap to tell.

1615	SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.
1616	
1617	
1618	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE, with a basket]
1619	
1620	FRIAR LAURENCE	The grey-eyed morn smiles on the frowning night,
1621	Chequering the eastern clouds with streaks of light,
1622	And flecked darkness like a drunkard reels
1623	From forth day's path and Titan's fiery wheels:
1624	Now, ere the sun advance his burning eye,
1625	The day to cheer and night's dank dew to dry,
1626	I must up-fill this osier cage of ours
1627	With baleful weeds and precious-juiced flowers.
1628	The earth that's nature's mother is her tomb;
1629	What is her burying grave that is her womb,
1630	And from her womb children of divers kind
1631	We sucking on her natural bosom find,
1632	Many for many virtues excellent,
1633	None but for some and yet all different.
1634	O, mickle is the powerful grace that lies
1635	In herbs, plants, stones, and their true qualities:
1636	For nought so vile that on the earth doth live
1637	But to the earth some special good doth give,
1638	Nor aught so good but strain'd from that fair use
1639	Revolts from true birth, stumbling on abuse:
1640	Virtue itself turns vice, being misapplied;
1641	And vice sometimes by action dignified.
1642	Within the infant rind of this small flower
1643	Poison hath residence and medicine power:
1644	For this, being smelt, with that part cheers each part;
1645	Being tasted, slays all senses with the heart.
1646	Two such opposed kings encamp them still
1647	In man as well as herbs, grace and rude will;
1648	And where the worser is predominant,
1649	Full soon the canker death eats up that plant.
1650	
1651	[Enter ROMEO]
1652	
1653	ROMEO	Good morrow, father.
1654	
1655	FRIAR LAURENCE	Benedicite!
1656	What early tongue so sweet saluteth me?
1657	Young son, it argues a distemper'd head
1658	So soon to bid good morrow to thy bed:
1659	Care keeps his watch in every old man's eye,
1660	And where care lodges, sleep will never lie;
1661	But where unbruised youth with unstuff'd brain
1662	Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign:
1663	Therefore thy earliness doth me assure
1664	Thou art up-roused by some distemperature;
1665	Or if not so, then here I hit it right,
1666	Our Romeo hath not been in bed to-night.
1667	
1668	ROMEO	That last is true; the sweeter rest was mine.
1669	
1670	FRIAR LAURENCE	God pardon sin! wast thou with Rosaline?
1671	
1672	ROMEO	With Rosaline, my ghostly father? no;
1673	I have forgot that name, and that name's woe.
1674	
1675	FRIAR LAURENCE	That's my good son: but where hast thou been, then?
1676	
1677	ROMEO	I'll tell thee, ere thou ask it me again.
1678	I have been feasting with mine enemy,
1679	Where on a sudden one hath wounded me,
1680	That's by me wounded: both our remedies
1681	Within thy help and holy physic lies:
1682	I bear no hatred, blessed man, for, lo,
1683	My intercession likewise steads my foe.
1684	
1685	FRIAR LAURENCE	Be plain, good son, and homely in thy drift;
1686	Riddling confession finds but riddling shrift.
1687	
1688	ROMEO	Then plainly know my heart's dear love is set
1689	On the fair daughter of rich Capulet:
1690	As mine on hers, so hers is set on mine;
1691	And all combined, save what thou must combine
1692	By holy marriage: when and where and how
1693	We met, we woo'd and made exchange of vow,
1694	I'll tell thee as we pass; but this I pray,
1695	That thou consent to marry us to-day.
1696	
1697	FRIAR LAURENCE	Holy Saint Francis, what a change is here!
1698	Is Rosaline, whom thou didst love so dear,
1699	So soon forsaken? young men's love then lies
1700	Not truly in their hearts, but in their eyes.
1701	Jesu Maria, what a deal of brine
1702	Hath wash'd thy sallow cheeks for Rosaline!
1703	How much salt water thrown away in waste,
1704	To season love, that of it doth not taste!
1705	The sun not yet thy sighs from heaven clears,
1706	Thy old groans ring yet in my ancient ears;
1707	Lo, here upon thy cheek the stain doth sit
1708	Of an old tear that is not wash'd off yet:
1709	If e'er thou wast thyself and these woes thine,
1710	Thou and these woes were all for Rosaline:
1711	And art thou changed? pronounce this sentence then,
1712	Women may fall, when there's no strength in men.
1713	
1714	ROMEO	Thou chid'st me oft for loving Rosaline.
1715	
1716	FRIAR LAURENCE	For doting, not for loving, pupil mine.
1717	
1718	ROMEO	And bad'st me bury love.
1719	
1720	FRIAR LAURENCE	Not in a grave,
1721	To lay one in, another out to have.
1722	
1723	ROMEO	I pray thee, chide not; she whom I love now
1724	Doth grace for grace and love for love allow;
1725	The other did not so.
1726	
1727	FRIAR LAURENCE	O, she knew well
1728	Thy love did read by rote and could not spell.
1729	But come, young waverer, come, go with me,
1730	In one respect I'll thy assistant be;
1731	For this alliance may so happy prove,
1732	To turn your households' rancour to pure love.
1733	
1734	ROMEO	O, let us hence; I stand on sudden haste.
1735	
1736	FRIAR LAURENCE	Wisely and slow; they stumble that run fast.

1746	ACT II
1747	
1748	
1749	
1750	SCENE IV	A street.
1751	
1752	
1753	[Enter BENVOLIO and MERCUTIO]
1754	
1755	MERCUTIO	Where the devil should this Romeo be?
1756	Came he not home to-night?
1757	
1758	BENVOLIO	Not to his father's; I spoke with his man.
1759	
1760	MERCUTIO	Ah, that same pale hard-hearted wench, that Rosaline.
1761	Torments him so, that he will sure run mad.
1762	
1763	BENVOLIO	Tybalt, the kinsman of old Capulet,
1764	Hath sent a letter to his father's house.
1765	
1766	MERCUTIO	A challenge, on my life.
1767	
1768	BENVOLIO	Romeo will answer it.
1769	
1770	MERCUTIO	Any man that can write may answer a letter.
1771	
1772	BENVOLIO	Nay, he will answer the letter's master, how he
1773	dares, being dared.
1774	
1775	MERCUTIO	Alas poor Romeo! he is already dead; stabbed with a
1776	white wench's black eye; shot through the ear with a
1777	love-song; the very pin of his heart cleft with the
1778	blind bow-boy's butt-shaft: and is he a man to
1779	encounter Tybalt?
1780	
1781	BENVOLIO	Why, what is Tybalt?
1782	
1783	MERCUTIO	More than prince of cats, I can tell you. O, he is
1784	the courageous captain of compliments. He fights as
1785	you sing prick-song, keeps time, distance, and
1786	proportion; rests me his minim rest, one, two, and
1787	the third in your bosom: the very butcher of a silk
1788	button, a duellist, a duellist; a gentleman of the
1789	very first house, of the first and second cause:
1790	ah, the immortal passado! the punto reverso! the
1791	hai!
1792	
1793	BENVOLIO	The what?
1794	
1795	MERCUTIO	The pox of such antic, lisping, affecting
1796	fantasticoes; these new tuners of accents! 'By Jesu,
1797	a very good blade! a very tall man! a very good
1798	whore!' Why, is not this a lamentable thing,
1799	grandsire, that we should be thus afflicted with
1800	these strange flies, these fashion-mongers, these
1801	perdona-mi's, who stand so much on the new form,
1802	that they cannot at ease on the old bench? O, their
1803	bones, their bones!
1804	
1805	[Enter ROMEO]
1806	
1807	BENVOLIO	Here comes Romeo, here comes Romeo.
1808	
1809	MERCUTIO	Without his roe, like a dried herring: flesh, flesh,
1810	how art thou fishified! Now is he for the numbers
1811	that Petrarch flowed in: Laura to his lady was but a
1812	kitchen-wench; marry, she had a better love to
1813	be-rhyme her; Dido a dowdy; Cleopatra a gipsy;
1814	Helen and Hero hildings and harlots; Thisbe a grey
1815	eye or so, but not to the purpose. Signior
1816	Romeo, bon jour! there's a French salutation
1817	to your French slop. You gave us the counterfeit
1818	fairly last night.
1819	
1820	ROMEO	Good morrow to you both. What counterfeit did I give you?
1821	
1822	MERCUTIO	The ship, sir, the slip; can you not conceive?
1823	
1824	ROMEO	Pardon, good Mercutio, my business was great; and in
1825	such a case as mine a man may strain courtesy.
1826	
1827	MERCUTIO	That's as much as to say, such a case as yours
1828	constrains a man to bow in the hams.
1829	
1830	ROMEO	Meaning, to court'sy.
1831	
1832	MERCUTIO	Thou hast most kindly hit it.
1833	
1834	ROMEO	A most courteous exposition.
1835	
1836	MERCUTIO	Nay, I am the very pink of courtesy.
1837	
1838	ROMEO	Pink for flower.
1839	
1840	MERCUTIO	Right.
1841	
1842	ROMEO	Why, then is my pump well flowered.
1843	
1844	MERCUTIO	Well said: follow me this jest now till thou hast
1845	worn out thy pump, that when the single sole of it
1846	is worn, the jest may remain after the wearing sole singular.
1847	
1848	ROMEO	O single-soled jest, solely singular for the
1849	singleness.
1850	
1851	MERCUTIO	Come between us, good Benvolio; my wits faint.
1852	
1853	ROMEO	Switch and spurs, switch and spurs; or I'll cry a match.
1854	
1855	MERCUTIO	Nay, if thy wits run the wild-goose chase, I have
1856	done, for thou hast more of the wild-goose in one of
1857	thy wits than, I am sure, I have in my whole five:
1858	was I with you there for the goose?
1859	
1860	ROMEO	Thou wast never with me for any thing when thou wast
1861	not there for the goose.
1862	
1863	MERCUTIO	I will bite thee by the ear for that jest.
1864	
1865	ROMEO	Nay, good goose, bite not.
1866	
1867	MERCUTIO	Thy wit is a very bitter sweeting; it is a most
1868	sharp sauce.
1869	
1870	ROMEO	And is it not well served in to a sweet goose?
1871	
1872	MERCUTIO	O here's a wit of cheveril, that stretches from an
1873	inch narrow to an ell broad!
1874	
1875	ROMEO	I stretch it out for that word 'broad;' which added
1876	to the goose, proves thee far and wide a broad goose.
1877	
1878	MERCUTIO	Why, is not this better now than groaning for love?
1879	now art thou sociable, now art thou Romeo; now art
1880	thou what thou art, by art as well as by nature:
1881	for this drivelling love is like a great natural,
1882	that runs lolling up and down to hide his bauble in a hole.
1883	
1884	BENVOLIO	Stop there, stop there.
1885	
1886	MERCUTIO	Thou desirest me to stop in my tale against the hair.
1887	
1888	BENVOLIO	Thou wouldst else have made thy tale large.
1889	
1890	MERCUTIO	O, thou art deceived; I would have made it short:
1891	for I was come to the whole depth of my tale; and
1892	meant, indeed, to occupy the argument no longer.
1893	
1894	ROMEO	Here's goodly gear!
1895	
1896	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
1897	
1898	MERCUTIO	A sail, a sail!
1899	
1900	BENVOLIO	Two, two; a shirt and a smock.
1901	
1902	Nurse	Peter!
1903	
1904	PETER	Anon!
1905	
1906	Nurse	My fan, Peter.
1907	
1908	MERCUTIO	Good Peter, to hide her face; for her fan's the
1909	fairer face.
1910	
1911	Nurse	God ye good morrow, gentlemen.
1912	
1913	MERCUTIO	God ye good den, fair gentlewoman.
1914	
1915	Nurse	Is it good den?
1916	
1917	MERCUTIO	'Tis no less, I tell you, for the bawdy hand of the
1918	dial is now upon the prick of noon.
1919	
1920	Nurse	Out upon you! what a man are you!
1921	
1922	ROMEO	One, gentlewoman, that God hath made for himself to
1923	mar.
1924	
1925	Nurse	By my troth, it is well said; 'for himself to mar,'
1926	quoth a'? Gentlemen, can any of you tell me where I
1927	may find the young Romeo?
1928	
1929	ROMEO	I can tell you; but young Romeo will be older when
1930	you have found him than he was when you sought him:
1931	I am the youngest of that name, for fault of a worse.
1932	
1933	Nurse	You say well.
1934	
1935	MERCUTIO	Yea, is the worst well? very well took, i' faith;
1936	wisely, wisely.
1937	
1938	Nurse	if you be he, sir, I desire some confidence with
1939	you.
1940	
1941	BENVOLIO	She will indite him to some supper.
1942	
1943	MERCUTIO	A bawd, a bawd, a bawd! so ho!
1944	
1945	ROMEO	What hast thou found?
1946	
1947	MERCUTIO	No hare, sir; unless a hare, sir, in a lenten pie,
1948	that is something stale and hoar ere it be spent.
1949	
1950	[Sings]
1951	
1952	An old hare hoar,
1953	And an old hare hoar,
1954	Is very good meat in lent
1955	But a hare that is hoar
1956	Is too much for a score,
1957	When it hoars ere it be spent.
1958	Romeo, will you come to your father's? we'll
1959	to dinner, thither.
1960	
1961	ROMEO	I will follow you.
1962	
1963	MERCUTIO	Farewell, ancient lady; farewell,
1964	
1965	[Singing]
1966	
1967	'lady, lady, lady.'
1968	
1969	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
1970	
1971	Nurse	Marry, farewell! I pray you, sir, what saucy
1972	merchant was this, that was so full of his ropery?
1973	
1974	ROMEO	A gentleman, nurse, that loves to hear himself talk,
1975	and will speak more in a minute than he will stand
1976	to in a month.
1977	
1978	Nurse	An a' speak any thing against me, I'll take him
1979	down, an a' were lustier than he is, and twenty such
1980	Jacks; and if I cannot, I'll find those that shall.
1981	Scurvy knave! I am none of his flirt-gills; I am
1982	none of his skains-mates. And thou must stand by
1983	too, and suffer every knave to use me at his pleasure?
1984	
1985	PETER	I saw no man use you a pleasure; if I had, my weapon
1986	should quickly have been out, I warrant you: I dare
1987	draw as soon as another man, if I see occasion in a
1988	good quarrel, and the law on my side.
1989	
1990	Nurse	Now, afore God, I am so vexed, that every part about
1991	me quivers. Scurvy knave! Pray you, sir, a word:
1992	and as I told you, my young lady bade me inquire you
1993	out; what she bade me say, I will keep to myself:
1994	but first let me tell ye, if ye should lead her into
1995	a fool's paradise, as they say, it were a very gross
1996	kind of behavior, as they say: for the gentlewoman
1997	is young; and, therefore, if you should deal double
1998	with her, truly it were an ill thing to be offered
1999	to any gentlewoman, and very weak dealing.
2000	
2001	ROMEO	Nurse, commend me to thy lady and mistress. I
2002	protest unto thee--
2003	
2004	Nurse	Good heart, and, i' faith, I will tell her as much:
2005	Lord, Lord, she will be a joyful woman.
2006	
2007	ROMEO	What wilt thou tell her, nurse? thou dost not mark me.
2008	
2009	Nurse	I will tell her, sir, that you do protest; which, as
2010	I take it, is a gentlemanlike offer.
2011	
2012	ROMEO	Bid her devise
2013	Some means to come to shrift this afternoon;
2014	And there she shall at Friar Laurence' cell
2015	Be shrived and married. Here is for thy pains.
2016	
2017	Nurse	No truly sir; not a penny.
2018	
2019	ROMEO	Go to; I say you shall.
2020	
2021	Nurse	This afternoon, sir? well, she shall be there.
2022	
2023	ROMEO	And stay, good nurse, behind the abbey wall:
2024	Within this hour my man shall be with thee
2025	And bring thee cords made like a tackled stair;
2026	Which to the high top-gallant of my joy
2027	Must be my convoy in the secret night.
2028	Farewell; be trusty, and I'll quit thy pains:
2029	Farewell; commend me to thy mistress.
2030	
2031	Nurse	Now God in heaven bless thee! Hark you, sir.
2032	
2033	ROMEO	What say'st thou, my dear nurse?
2034	
2035	Nurse	Is your man secret? Did you ne'er hear say,
2036	Two may keep counsel, putting one away?
2037	
2038	ROMEO	I warrant thee, my man's as true as steel.
2039	
2040	NURSE	Well, sir; my mistress is the sweetest lady--Lord,
2041	Lord! when 'twas a little prating thing:--O, there
2042	is a nobleman in town, one Paris, that would fain
2043	lay knife aboard; but she, good soul, had as lief
2044	see a toad, a very toad, as see him. I anger her
2045	sometimes and tell her that Paris is the properer
2046	man; but, I'll warrant you, when I say so, she looks
2047	as pale as any clout in the versal world. Doth not
2048	rosemary and Romeo begin both with a letter?
2049	
2050	ROMEO	Ay, nurse; what of that? both with an R.
2051	
2052	Nurse	Ah. mocker! that's the dog's name; R is for
2053	the--No; I know it begins with some other
2054	letter:--and she hath the prettiest sententious of
2055	it, of you and rosemary, that it would do you good
2056	to hear it.
2057	
2058	ROMEO	Commend me to thy lady.
2059	
2060	Nurse	Ay, a thousand times.
2061	
2062	[Exit Romeo]
2063	Peter!
2064	
2065	PETER	Anon!
2066	
2067	Nurse	Peter, take my fan, and go before and apace.

2081	SCENE V	Capulet's orchard.
2082	
2083	
2084	[Enter JULIET]
2085	
2086	JULIET	The clock struck nine when I did send the nurse;
2087	In half an hour she promised to return.
2088	Perchance she cannot meet him: that's not so.
2089	O, she is lame! love's heralds should be thoughts,
2090	Which ten times faster glide than the sun's beams,
2091	Driving back shadows over louring hills:
2092	Therefore do nimble-pinion'd doves draw love,
2093	And therefore hath the wind-swift Cupid wings.
2094	Now is the sun upon the highmost hill
2095	Of this day's journey, and from nine till twelve
2096	Is three long hours, yet she is not come.
2097	Had she affections and warm youthful blood,
2098	She would be as swift in motion as a ball;
2099	My words would bandy her to my sweet love,
2100	And his to me:
2101	But old folks, many feign as they were dead;
2102	Unwieldy, slow, heavy and pale as lead.
2103	O God, she comes!
2104	
2105	[Enter Nurse and PETER]
2106	
2107	O honey nurse, what news?
2108	Hast thou met with him? Send thy man away.
2109	
2110	Nurse	Peter, stay at the gate.
2111	
2112	[Exit PETER]
2113	
2114	JULIET	Now, good sweet nurse,--O Lord, why look'st thou sad?
2115	Though news be sad, yet tell them merrily;
2116	If good, thou shamest the music of sweet news
2117	By playing it to me with so sour a face.
2118	
2119	Nurse	I am a-weary, give me leave awhile:
2120	Fie, how my bones ache! what a jaunt have I had!
2121	
2122	JULIET	I would thou hadst my bones, and I thy news:
2123	Nay, come, I pray thee, speak; good, good nurse, speak.
2124	
2125	Nurse	Jesu, what haste? can you not stay awhile?
2126	Do you not see that I am out of breath?
2127	
2128	JULIET	How art thou out of breath, when thou hast breath
2129	To say to me that thou art out of breath?
2130	The excuse that thou dost make in this delay
2131	Is longer than the tale thou dost excuse.
2132	Is thy news good, or bad? answer to that;
2133	Say either, and I'll stay the circumstance:
2134	Let me be satisfied, is't good or bad?
2135	
2136	Nurse	Well, you have made a simple choice; you know not
2137	how to choose a man: Romeo! no, not he; though his
2138	face be better than any man's, yet his leg excels
2139	all men's; and for a hand, and a foot, and a body,
2140	though they be not to be talked on, yet they are
2141	past compare: he is not the flower of courtesy,
2142	but, I'll warrant him, as gentle as a lamb. Go thy
2143	ways, wench; serve God. What, have you dined at home?
2144	
2145	JULIET	No, no: but all this did I know before.
2146	What says he of our marriage? what of that?
2147	
2148	Nurse	Lord, how my head aches! what a head have I!
2149	It beats as it would fall in twenty pieces.
2150	My back o' t' other side,--O, my back, my back!
2151	Beshrew your heart for sending me about,
2152	To catch my death with jaunting up and down!
2153	
2154	JULIET	I' faith, I am sorry that thou art not well.
2155	Sweet, sweet, sweet nurse, tell me, what says my love?
2156	
2157	Nurse	Your love says, like an honest gentleman, and a
2158	courteous, and a kind, and a handsome, and, I
2159	warrant, a virtuous,--Where is your mother?
2160	
2161	JULIET	Where is my mother! why, she is within;
2162	Where should she be? How oddly thou repliest!
2163	'Your love says, like an honest gentleman,
2164	Where is your mother?'
2165	
2166	Nurse	O God's lady dear!
2167	Are you so hot? marry, come up, I trow;
2168	Is this the poultice for my aching bones?
2169	Henceforward do your messages yourself.
2170	
2171	JULIET	Here's such a coil! come, what says Romeo?
2172	
2173	Nurse	Have you got leave to go to shrift to-day?
2174	
2175	JULIET	I have.
2176	
2177	Nurse	Then hie you hence to Friar Laurence' cell;
2178	There stays a husband to make you a wife:
2179	Now comes the wanton blood up in your cheeks,
2180	They'll be in scarlet straight at any news.
2181	Hie you to church; I must another way,
2182	To fetch a ladder, by the which your love
2183	Must climb a bird's nest soon when it is dark:
2184	I am the drudge and toil in your delight,
2185	But you shall bear the burden soon at night.
2186	Go; I'll to dinner: hie you to the cell.
2187	
2188	JULIET	Hie to high fortune! Honest nurse, farewell.

2202	SCENE VI	Friar Laurence's cell.
2203	
2204	
2205	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and ROMEO]
2206	
2207	FRIAR LAURENCE	So smile the heavens upon this holy act,
2208	That after hours with sorrow chide us not!
2209	
2210	ROMEO	Amen, amen! but come what sorrow can,
2211	It cannot countervail the exchange of joy
2212	That one short minute gives me in her sight:
2213	Do thou but close our hands with holy words,
2214	Then love-devouring death do what he dare;
2215	It is enough I may but call her mine.
2216	
2217	FRIAR LAURENCE	These violent delights have violent ends
2218	And in their triumph die, like fire and powder,
2219	Which as they kiss consume: the sweetest honey
2220	Is loathsome in his own deliciousness
2221	And in the taste confounds the appetite:
2222	Therefore love moderately; long love doth so;
2223	Too swift arrives as tardy as too slow.
2224	
2225	[Enter JULIET]
2226	
2227	Here comes the lady: O, so light a foot
2228	Will ne'er wear out the everlasting flint:
2229	A lover may bestride the gossamer
2230	That idles in the wanton summer air,
2231	And yet not fall; so light is vanity.
2232	
2233	JULIET	Good even to my ghostly confessor.
2234	
2235	FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo shall thank thee, daughter, for us both.
2236	
2237	JULIET	As much to him, else is his thanks too much.
2238	
2239	ROMEO	Ah, Juliet, if the measure of thy joy
2240	Be heap'd like mine and that thy skill be more
2241	To blazon it, then sweeten with thy breath
2242	This neighbour air, and let rich music's tongue
2243	Unfold the imagined happiness that both
2244	Receive in either by this dear encounter.
2245	
2246	JULIET	Conceit, more rich in matter than in words,
2247	Brags of his substance, not of ornament:
2248	They are but beggars that can count their worth;
2249	But my true love is grown to such excess
2250	I cannot sum up sum of half my wealth.
2251	
2252	FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, come with me, and we will make short work;
2253	For, by your leaves, you shall not stay alone
2254	Till holy church incorporate two in one.
2255

2264	ACT III
2265	
2266	
2267	
2268	SCENE I	A public place.
2269	
2270	
2271	[Enter MERCUTIO, BENVOLIO, Page, and Servants]
2272	
2273	BENVOLIO	I pray thee, good Mercutio, let's retire:
2274	The day is hot, the Capulets abroad,
2275	And, if we meet, we shall not scape a brawl;
2276	For now, these hot days, is the mad blood stirring.
2277	
2278	MERCUTIO	Thou art like one of those fellows that when he
2279	enters the confines of a tavern claps me his sword
2280	upon the table and says 'God send me no need of
2281	thee!' and by the operation of the second cup draws
2282	it on the drawer, when indeed there is no need.
2283	
2284	BENVOLIO	Am I like such a fellow?
2285	
2286	MERCUTIO	Come, come, thou art as hot a Jack in thy mood as
2287	any in Italy, and as soon moved to be moody, and as
2288	soon moody to be moved.
2289	
2290	BENVOLIO	And what to?
2291	
2292	MERCUTIO	Nay, an there were two such, we should have none
2293	shortly, for one would kill the other. Thou! why,
2294	thou wilt quarrel with a man that hath a hair more,
2295	or a hair less, in his beard, than thou hast: thou
2296	wilt quarrel with a man for cracking nuts, having no
2297	other reason but because thou hast hazel eyes: what
2298	eye but such an eye would spy out such a quarrel?
2299	Thy head is as fun of quarrels as an egg is full of
2300	meat, and yet thy head hath been beaten as addle as
2301	an egg for quarrelling: thou hast quarrelled with a
2302	man for coughing in the street, because he hath
2303	wakened thy dog that hath lain asleep in the sun:
2304	didst thou not fall out with a tailor for wearing
2305	his new doublet before Easter? with another, for
2306	tying his new shoes with old riband? and yet thou
2307	wilt tutor me from quarrelling!
2308	
2309	BENVOLIO	An I were so apt to quarrel as thou art, any man
2310	should buy the fee-simple of my life for an hour and a quarter.
2311	
2312	MERCUTIO	The fee-simple! O simple!
2313	
2314	BENVOLIO	By my head, here come the Capulets.
2315	
2316	MERCUTIO	By my heel, I care not.
2317	
2318	[Enter TYBALT and others]
2319	
2320	TYBALT	Follow me close, for I will speak to them.
2321	Gentlemen, good den: a word with one of you.
2322	
2323	MERCUTIO	And but one word with one of us? couple it with
2324	something; make it a word and a blow.
2325	
2326	TYBALT	You shall find me apt enough to that, sir, an you
2327	will give me occasion.
2328	
2329	MERCUTIO	Could you not take some occasion without giving?
2330	
2331	TYBALT	Mercutio, thou consort'st with Romeo,--
2332	
2333	MERCUTIO	Consort! what, dost thou make us minstrels? an
2334	thou make minstrels of us, look to hear nothing but
2335	discords: here's my fiddlestick; here's that shall
2336	make you dance. 'Zounds, consort!
2337	
2338	BENVOLIO	We talk here in the public haunt of men:
2339	Either withdraw unto some private place,
2340	And reason coldly of your grievances,
2341	Or else depart; here all eyes gaze on us.
2342	
2343	MERCUTIO	Men's eyes were made to look, and let them gaze;
2344	I will not budge for no man's pleasure, I.
2345	
2346	[Enter ROMEO]
2347	
2348	TYBALT	Well, peace be with you, sir: here comes my man.
2349	
2350	MERCUTIO	But I'll be hanged, sir, if he wear your livery:
2351	Marry, go before to field, he'll be your follower;
2352	Your worship in that sense may call him 'man.'
2353	
2354	TYBALT	Romeo, the hate I bear thee can afford
2355	No better term than this,--thou art a villain.
2356	
2357	ROMEO	Tybalt, the reason that I have to love thee
2358	Doth much excuse the appertaining rage
2359	To such a greeting: villain am I none;
2360	Therefore farewell; I see thou know'st me not.
2361	
2362	TYBALT	Boy, this shall not excuse the injuries
2363	That thou hast done me; therefore turn and draw.
2364	
2365	ROMEO	I do protest, I never injured thee,
2366	But love thee better than thou canst devise,
2367	Till thou shalt know the reason of my love:
2368	And so, good Capulet,--which name I tender
2369	As dearly as my own,--be satisfied.
2370	
2371	MERCUTIO	O calm, dishonourable, vile submission!
2372	Alla stoccata carries it away.
2373	
2374	[Draws]
2375	
2376	Tybalt, you rat-catcher, will you walk?
2377	
2378	TYBALT	What wouldst thou have with me?
2379	
2380	MERCUTIO	Good king of cats, nothing but one of your nine
2381	lives; that I mean to make bold withal, and as you
2382	shall use me hereafter, drybeat the rest of the
2383	eight. Will you pluck your sword out of his pitcher
2384	by the ears? make haste, lest mine be about your
2385	ears ere it be out.
2386	
2387	TYBALT	I am for you.
2388	
2389	[Drawing]
2390	
2391	ROMEO	Gentle Mercutio, put thy rapier up.
2392	
2393	MERCUTIO	Come, sir, your passado.
2394	
2395	[They fight]
2396	
2397	ROMEO	Draw, Benvolio; beat down their weapons.
2398	Gentlemen, for shame, forbear this outrage!
2399	Tybalt, Mercutio, the prince expressly hath
2400	Forbidden bandying in Verona streets:
2401	Hold, Tybalt! good Mercutio!
2402	
2403	[TYBALT under ROMEO's arm stabs MERCUTIO, and flies
2404	with his followers]
2405	
2406	MERCUTIO	I am hurt.
2407	A plague o' both your houses! I am sped.
2408	Is he gone, and hath nothing?
2409	
2410	BENVOLIO	What, art thou hurt?
2411	
2412	MERCUTIO	Ay, ay, a scratch, a scratch; marry, 'tis enough.
2413	Where is my page? Go, villain, fetch a surgeon.
2414	
2415	[Exit Page]
2416	
2417	ROMEO	Courage, man; the hurt cannot be much.
2418	
2419	MERCUTIO	No, 'tis not so deep as a well, nor so wide as a
2420	church-door; but 'tis enough,'twill serve: ask for
2421	me to-morrow, and you shall find me a grave man. I
2422	am peppered, I warrant, for this world. A plague o'
2423	both your houses! 'Zounds, a dog, a rat, a mouse, a
2424	cat, to scratch a man to death! a braggart, a
2425	rogue, a villain, that fights by the book of
2426	arithmetic! Why the devil came you between us? I
2427	was hurt under your arm.
2428	
2429	ROMEO	I thought all for the best.
2430	
2431	MERCUTIO	Help me into some house, Benvolio,
2432	Or I shall faint. A plague o' both your houses!
2433	They have made worms' meat of me: I have it,
2434	And soundly too: your houses!
2435	
2436	[Exeunt MERCUTIO and BENVOLIO]
2437	
2438	ROMEO	This gentleman, the prince's near ally,
2439	My very friend, hath got his mortal hurt
2440	In my behalf; my reputation stain'd
2441	With Tybalt's slander,--Tybalt, that an hour
2442	Hath been my kinsman! O sweet Juliet,
2443	Thy beauty hath made me effeminate
2444	And in my temper soften'd valour's steel!
2445	
2446	[Re-enter BENVOLIO]
2447	
2448	BENVOLIO	O Romeo, Romeo, brave Mercutio's dead!
2449	That gallant spirit hath aspired the clouds,
2450	Which too untimely here did scorn the earth.
2451	
2452	ROMEO	This day's black fate on more days doth depend;
2453	This but begins the woe, others must end.
2454	
2455	BENVOLIO	Here comes the furious Tybalt back again.
2456	
2457	ROMEO	Alive, in triumph! and Mercutio slain!
2458	Away to heaven, respective lenity,
2459	And fire-eyed fury be my conduct now!
2460	
2461	[Re-enter TYBALT]
2462	
2463	Now, Tybalt, take the villain back again,
2464	That late thou gavest me; for Mercutio's soul
2465	Is but a little way above our heads,
2466	Staying for thine to keep him company:
2467	Either thou, or I, or both, must go with him.
2468	
2469	TYBALT	Thou, wretched boy, that didst consort him here,
2470	Shalt with him hence.
2471	
2472	ROMEO	This shall determine that.
2473	
2474	[They fight; TYBALT falls]
2475	
2476	BENVOLIO	Romeo, away, be gone!
2477	The citizens are up, and Tybalt slain.
2478	Stand not amazed: the prince will doom thee death,
2479	If thou art taken: hence, be gone, away!
2480	
2481	ROMEO	O, I am fortune's fool!
2482	
2483	BENVOLIO	Why dost thou stay?
2484	
2485	[Exit ROMEO]
2486	
2487	[Enter Citizens, &c]
2488	
2489	First Citizen	Which way ran he that kill'd Mercutio?
2490	Tybalt, that murderer, which way ran he?
2491	
2492	BENVOLIO	There lies that Tybalt.
2493	
2494	First Citizen	Up, sir, go with me;
2495	I charge thee in the princes name, obey.
2496	
2497	[Enter Prince, attended; MONTAGUE, CAPULET, their
2498	Wives, and others]
2499	
2500	PRINCE	Where are the vile beginners of this fray?
2501	
2502	BENVOLIO	O noble prince, I can discover all
2503	The unlucky manage of this fatal brawl:
2504	There lies the man, slain by young Romeo,
2505	That slew thy kinsman, brave Mercutio.
2506	
2507	LADY CAPULET	Tybalt, my cousin! O my brother's child!
2508	O prince! O cousin! husband! O, the blood is spilt
2509	O my dear kinsman! Prince, as thou art true,
2510	For blood of ours, shed blood of Montague.
2511	O cousin, cousin!
2512	
2513	PRINCE	Benvolio, who began this bloody fray?
2514	
2515	BENVOLIO	Tybalt, here slain, whom Romeo's hand did slay;
2516	Romeo that spoke him fair, bade him bethink
2517	How nice the quarrel was, and urged withal
2518	Your high displeasure: all this uttered
2519	With gentle breath, calm look, knees humbly bow'd,
2520	Could not take truce with the unruly spleen
2521	Of Tybalt deaf to peace, but that he tilts
2522	With piercing steel at bold Mercutio's breast,
2523	Who all as hot, turns deadly point to point,
2524	And, with a martial scorn, with one hand beats
2525	Cold death aside, and with the other sends
2526	It back to Tybalt, whose dexterity,
2527	Retorts it: Romeo he cries aloud,
2528	'Hold, friends! friends, part!' and, swifter than
2529	his tongue,
2530	His agile arm beats down their fatal points,
2531	And 'twixt them rushes; underneath whose arm
2532	An envious thrust from Tybalt hit the life
2533	Of stout Mercutio, and then Tybalt fled;
2534	But by and by comes back to Romeo,
2535	Who had but newly entertain'd revenge,
2536	And to 't they go like lightning, for, ere I
2537	Could draw to part them, was stout Tybalt slain.
2538	And, as he fell, did Romeo turn and fly.
2539	This is the truth, or let Benvolio die.
2540	
2541	LADY CAPULET	He is a kinsman to the Montague;
2542	Affection makes him false; he speaks not true:
2543	Some twenty of them fought in this black strife,
2544	And all those twenty could but kill one life.
2545	I beg for justice, which thou, prince, must give;
2546	Romeo slew Tybalt, Romeo must not live.
2547	
2548	PRINCE	Romeo slew him, he slew Mercutio;
2549	Who now the price of his dear blood doth owe?
2550	
2551	MONTAGUE	Not Romeo, prince, he was Mercutio's friend;
2552	His fault concludes but what the law should end,
2553	The life of Tybalt.
2554	
2555	PRINCE	And for that offence
2556	Immediately we do exile him hence:
2557	I have an interest in your hate's proceeding,
2558	My blood for your rude brawls doth lie a-bleeding;
2559	But I'll amerce you with so strong a fine
2560	That you shall all repent the loss of mine:
2561	I will be deaf to pleading and excuses;
2562	Nor tears nor prayers shall purchase out abuses:
2563	Therefore use none: let Romeo hence in haste,
2564	Else, when he's found, that hour is his last.
2565	Bear hence this body and attend our will:
2566	Mercy but murders, pardoning those that kill.
2567

2576	ACT III
2577	
2578	
2579	
2580	SCENE II	Capulet's orchard.
2581	
2582	
2583	[Enter JULIET]
2584	
2585	JULIET	Gallop apace, you fiery-footed steeds,
2586	Towards Phoebus' lodging: such a wagoner
2587	As Phaethon would whip you to the west,
2588	And bring in cloudy night immediately.
2589	Spread thy close curtain, love-performing night,
2590	That runaway's eyes may wink and Romeo
2591	Leap to these arms, untalk'd of and unseen.
2592	Lovers can see to do their amorous rites
2593	By their own beauties; or, if love be blind,
2594	It best agrees with night. Come, civil night,
2595	Thou sober-suited matron, all in black,
2596	And learn me how to lose a winning match,
2597	Play'd for a pair of stainless maidenhoods:
2598	Hood my unmann'd blood, bating in my cheeks,
2599	With thy black mantle; till strange love, grown bold,
2600	Think true love acted simple modesty.
2601	Come, night; come, Romeo; come, thou day in night;
2602	For thou wilt lie upon the wings of night
2603	Whiter than new snow on a raven's back.
2604	Come, gentle night, come, loving, black-brow'd night,
2605	Give me my Romeo; and, when he shall die,
2606	Take him and cut him out in little stars,
2607	And he will make the face of heaven so fine
2608	That all the world will be in love with night
2609	And pay no worship to the garish sun.
2610	O, I have bought the mansion of a love,
2611	But not possess'd it, and, though I am sold,
2612	Not yet enjoy'd: so tedious is this day
2613	As is the night before some festival
2614	To an impatient child that hath new robes
2615	And may not wear them. O, here comes my nurse,
2616	And she brings news; and every tongue that speaks
2617	But Romeo's name speaks heavenly eloquence.
2618	
2619	[Enter Nurse, with cords]
2620	
2621	Now, nurse, what news? What hast thou there? the cords
2622	That Romeo bid thee fetch?
2623	
2624	Nurse	Ay, ay, the cords.
2625	
2626	[Throws them down]
2627	
2628	JULIET	Ay me! what news? why dost thou wring thy hands?
2629	
2630	Nurse	Ah, well-a-day! he's dead, he's dead, he's dead!
2631	We are undone, lady, we are undone!
2632	Alack the day! he's gone, he's kill'd, he's dead!
2633	
2634	JULIET	Can heaven be so envious?
2635	
2636	Nurse	Romeo can,
2637	Though heaven cannot: O Romeo, Romeo!
2638	Who ever would have thought it? Romeo!
2639	
2640	JULIET	What devil art thou, that dost torment me thus?
2641	This torture should be roar'd in dismal hell.
2642	Hath Romeo slain himself? say thou but 'I,'
2643	And that bare vowel 'I' shall poison more
2644	Than the death-darting eye of cockatrice:
2645	I am not I, if there be such an I;
2646	Or those eyes shut, that make thee answer 'I.'
2647	If he be slain, say 'I'; or if not, no:
2648	Brief sounds determine of my weal or woe.
2649	
2650	Nurse	I saw the wound, I saw it with mine eyes,--
2651	God save the mark!--here on his manly breast:
2652	A piteous corse, a bloody piteous corse;
2653	Pale, pale as ashes, all bedaub'd in blood,
2654	All in gore-blood; I swounded at the sight.
2655	
2656	JULIET	O, break, my heart! poor bankrupt, break at once!
2657	To prison, eyes, ne'er look on liberty!
2658	Vile earth, to earth resign; end motion here;
2659	And thou and Romeo press one heavy bier!
2660	
2661	Nurse	O Tybalt, Tybalt, the best friend I had!
2662	O courteous Tybalt! honest gentleman!
2663	That ever I should live to see thee dead!
2664	
2665	JULIET	What storm is this that blows so contrary?
2666	Is Romeo slaughter'd, and is Tybalt dead?
2667	My dear-loved cousin, and my dearer lord?
2668	Then, dreadful trumpet, sound the general doom!
2669	For who is living, if those two are gone?
2670	
2671	Nurse	Tybalt is gone, and Romeo banished;
2672	Romeo that kill'd him, he is banished.
2673	
2674	JULIET	O God! did Romeo's hand shed Tybalt's blood?
2675	
2676	Nurse	It did, it did; alas the day, it did!
2677	
2678	JULIET	O serpent heart, hid with a flowering face!
2679	Did ever dragon keep so fair a cave?
2680	Beautiful tyrant! fiend angelical!
2681	Dove-feather'd raven! wolvish-ravening lamb!
2682	Despised substance of divinest show!
2683	Just opposite to what thou justly seem'st,
2684	A damned saint, an honourable villain!
2685	O nature, what hadst thou to do in hell,
2686	When thou didst bower the spirit of a fiend
2687	In moral paradise of such sweet flesh?
2688	Was ever book containing such vile matter
2689	So fairly bound? O that deceit should dwell
2690	In such a gorgeous palace!
2691	
2692	Nurse	There's no trust,
2693	No faith, no honesty in men; all perjured,
2694	All forsworn, all naught, all dissemblers.
2695	Ah, where's my man? give me some aqua vitae:
2696	These griefs, these woes, these sorrows make me old.
2697	Shame come to Romeo!
2698	
2699	JULIET	Blister'd be thy tongue
2700	For such a wish! he was not born to shame:
2701	Upon his brow shame is ashamed to sit;
2702	For 'tis a throne where honour may be crown'd
2703	Sole monarch of the universal earth.
2704	O, what a beast was I to chide at him!
2705	
2706	Nurse	Will you speak well of him that kill'd your cousin?
2707	
2708	JULIET	Shall I speak ill of him that is my husband?
2709	Ah, poor my lord, what tongue shall smooth thy name,
2710	When I, thy three-hours wife, have mangled it?
2711	But, wherefore, villain, didst thou kill my cousin?
2712	That villain cousin would have kill'd my husband:
2713	Back, foolish tears, back to your native spring;
2714	Your tributary drops belong to woe,
2715	Which you, mistaking, offer up to joy.
2716	My husband lives, that Tybalt would have slain;
2717	And Tybalt's dead, that would have slain my husband:
2718	All this is comfort; wherefore weep I then?
2719	Some word there was, worser than Tybalt's death,
2720	That murder'd me: I would forget it fain;
2721	But, O, it presses to my memory,
2722	Like damned guilty deeds to sinners' minds:
2723	'Tybalt is dead, and Romeo--banished;'
2724	That 'banished,' that one word 'banished,'
2725	Hath slain ten thousand Tybalts. Tybalt's death
2726	Was woe enough, if it had ended there:
2727	Or, if sour woe delights in fellowship
2728	And needly will be rank'd with other griefs,
2729	Why follow'd not, when she said 'Tybalt's dead,'
2730	Thy father, or thy mother, nay, or both,
2731	Which modern lamentations might have moved?
2732	But with a rear-ward following Tybalt's death,
2733	'Romeo is banished,' to speak that word,
2734	Is father, mother, Tybalt, Romeo, Juliet,
2735	All slain, all dead. 'Romeo is banished!'
2736	There is no end, no limit, measure, bound,
2737	In that word's death; no words can that woe sound.
2738	Where is my father, and my mother, nurse?
2739	
2740	Nurse	Weeping and wailing over Tybalt's corse:
2741	Will you go to them? I will bring you thither.
2742	
2743	JULIET	Wash they his wounds with tears: mine shall be spent,
2744	When theirs are dry, for Romeo's banishment.
2745	Take up those cords: poor ropes, you are beguiled,
2746	Both you and I; for Romeo is exiled:
2747	He made you for a highway to my bed;
2748	But I, a maid, die maiden-widowed.
2749	Come, cords, come, nurse; I'll to my wedding-bed;
2750	And death, not Romeo, take my maidenhead!
2751	
2752	Nurse	Hie to your chamber: I'll find Romeo
2753	To comfort you: I wot well where he is.
2754	Hark ye, your Romeo will be here at night:
2755	I'll to him; he is hid at Laurence' cell.
2756	
2757	JULIET	O, find him! give this ring to my true knight,
2758	And bid him come to take his last farewell.

2768	ACT III
2769	
2770	
2771	
2772	SCENE III	Friar Laurence's cell.
2773	
2774	
2775	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
2776	
2777	FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo, come forth; come forth, thou fearful man:
2778	Affliction is enamour'd of thy parts,
2779	And thou art wedded to calamity.
2780	
2781	[Enter ROMEO]
2782	
2783	ROMEO	Father, what news? what is the prince's doom?
2784	What sorrow craves acquaintance at my hand,
2785	That I yet know not?
2786	
2787	FRIAR LAURENCE	Too familiar
2788	Is my dear son with such sour company:
2789	I bring thee tidings of the prince's doom.
2790	
2791	ROMEO	What less than dooms-day is the prince's doom?
2792	
2793	FRIAR LAURENCE	A gentler judgment vanish'd from his lips,
2794	Not body's death, but body's banishment.
2795	
2796	ROMEO	Ha, banishment! be merciful, say 'death;'
2797	For exile hath more terror in his look,
2798	Much more than death: do not say 'banishment.'
2799	
2800	FRIAR LAURENCE	Hence from Verona art thou banished:
2801	Be patient, for the world is broad and wide.
2802	
2803	ROMEO	There is no world without Verona walls,
2804	But purgatory, torture, hell itself.
2805	Hence-banished is banish'd from the world,
2806	And world's exile is death: then banished,
2807	Is death mis-term'd: calling death banishment,
2808	Thou cutt'st my head off with a golden axe,
2809	And smilest upon the stroke that murders me.
2810	
2811	FRIAR LAURENCE	O deadly sin! O rude unthankfulness!
2812	Thy fault our law calls death; but the kind prince,
2813	Taking thy part, hath rush'd aside the law,
2814	And turn'd that black word death to banishment:
2815	This is dear mercy, and thou seest it not.
2816	
2817	ROMEO	'Tis torture, and not mercy: heaven is here,
2818	Where Juliet lives; and every cat and dog
2819	And little mouse, every unworthy thing,
2820	Live here in heaven and may look on her;
2821	But Romeo may not: more validity,
2822	More honourable state, more courtship lives
2823	In carrion-flies than Romeo: they my seize
2824	On the white wonder of dear Juliet's hand
2825	And steal immortal blessing from her lips,
2826	Who even in pure and vestal modesty,
2827	Still blush, as thinking their own kisses sin;
2828	But Romeo may not; he is banished:
2829	Flies may do this, but I from this must fly:
2830	They are free men, but I am banished.
2831	And say'st thou yet that exile is not death?
2832	Hadst thou no poison mix'd, no sharp-ground knife,
2833	No sudden mean of death, though ne'er so mean,
2834	But 'banished' to kill me?--'banished'?
2835	O friar, the damned use that word in hell;
2836	Howlings attend it: how hast thou the heart,
2837	Being a divine, a ghostly confessor,
2838	A sin-absolver, and my friend profess'd,
2839	To mangle me with that word 'banished'?
2840	
2841	FRIAR LAURENCE	Thou fond mad man, hear me but speak a word.
2842	
2843	ROMEO	O, thou wilt speak again of banishment.
2844	
2845	FRIAR LAURENCE	I'll give thee armour to keep off that word:
2846	Adversity's sweet milk, philosophy,
2847	To comfort thee, though thou art banished.
2848	
2849	ROMEO	Yet 'banished'? Hang up philosophy!
2850	Unless philosophy can make a Juliet,
2851	Displant a town, reverse a prince's doom,
2852	It helps not, it prevails not: talk no more.
2853	
2854	FRIAR LAURENCE	O, then I see that madmen have no ears.
2855	
2856	ROMEO	How should they, when that wise men have no eyes?
2857	
2858	FRIAR LAURENCE	Let me dispute with thee of thy estate.
2859	
2860	ROMEO	Thou canst not speak of that thou dost not feel:
2861	Wert thou as young as I, Juliet thy love,
2862	An hour but married, Tybalt murdered,
2863	Doting like me and like me banished,
2864	Then mightst thou speak, then mightst thou tear thy hair,
2865	And fall upon the ground, as I do now,
2866	Taking the measure of an unmade grave.
2867	
2868	[Knocking within]
2869	
2870	FRIAR LAURENCE	Arise; one knocks; good Romeo, hide thyself.
2871	
2872	ROMEO	Not I; unless the breath of heartsick groans,
2873	Mist-like, infold me from the search of eyes.
2874	
2875	[Knocking]
2876	
2877	FRIAR LAURENCE	Hark, how they knock! Who's there? Romeo, arise;
2878	Thou wilt be taken. Stay awhile! Stand up;
2879	
2880	[Knocking]
2881	
2882	Run to my study. By and by! God's will,
2883	What simpleness is this! I come, I come!
2884	
2885	[Knocking]
2886	
2887	Who knocks so hard? whence come you? what's your will?
2888	
2889	Nurse	[Within]  Let me come in, and you shall know
2890	my errand;
2891	I come from Lady Juliet.
2892	
2893	FRIAR LAURENCE	Welcome, then.
2894	
2895	[Enter Nurse]
2896	
2897	Nurse	O holy friar, O, tell me, holy friar,
2898	Where is my lady's lord, where's Romeo?
2899	
2900	FRIAR LAURENCE	There on the ground, with his own tears made drunk.
2901	
2902	Nurse	O, he is even in my mistress' case,
2903	Just in her case! O woful sympathy!
2904	Piteous predicament! Even so lies she,
2905	Blubbering and weeping, weeping and blubbering.
2906	Stand up, stand up; stand, and you be a man:
2907	For Juliet's sake, for her sake, rise and stand;
2908	Why should you fall into so deep an O?
2909	
2910	ROMEO	Nurse!
2911	
2912	Nurse	Ah sir! ah sir! Well, death's the end of all.
2913	
2914	ROMEO	Spakest thou of Juliet? how is it with her?
2915	Doth she not think me an old murderer,
2916	Now I have stain'd the childhood of our joy
2917	With blood removed but little from her own?
2918	Where is she? and how doth she? and what says
2919	My conceal'd lady to our cancell'd love?
2920	
2921	Nurse	O, she says nothing, sir, but weeps and weeps;
2922	And now falls on her bed; and then starts up,
2923	And Tybalt calls; and then on Romeo cries,
2924	And then down falls again.
2925	
2926	ROMEO	As if that name,
2927	Shot from the deadly level of a gun,
2928	Did murder her; as that name's cursed hand
2929	Murder'd her kinsman. O, tell me, friar, tell me,
2930	In what vile part of this anatomy
2931	Doth my name lodge? tell me, that I may sack
2932	The hateful mansion.
2933	
2934	[Drawing his sword]
2935	
2936	FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold thy desperate hand:
2937	Art thou a man? thy form cries out thou art:
2938	Thy tears are womanish; thy wild acts denote
2939	The unreasonable fury of a beast:
2940	Unseemly woman in a seeming man!
2941	Or ill-beseeming beast in seeming both!
2942	Thou hast amazed me: by my holy order,
2943	I thought thy disposition better temper'd.
2944	Hast thou slain Tybalt? wilt thou slay thyself?
2945	And stay thy lady too that lives in thee,
2946	By doing damned hate upon thyself?
2947	Why rail'st thou on thy birth, the heaven, and earth?
2948	Since birth, and heaven, and earth, all three do meet
2949	In thee at once; which thou at once wouldst lose.
2950	Fie, fie, thou shamest thy shape, thy love, thy wit;
2951	Which, like a usurer, abound'st in all,
2952	And usest none in that true use indeed
2953	Which should bedeck thy shape, thy love, thy wit:
2954	Thy noble shape is but a form of wax,
2955	Digressing from the valour of a man;
2956	Thy dear love sworn but hollow perjury,
2957	Killing that love which thou hast vow'd to cherish;
2958	Thy wit, that ornament to shape and love,
2959	Misshapen in the conduct of them both,
2960	Like powder in a skitless soldier's flask,
2961	Is set afire by thine own ignorance,
2962	And thou dismember'd with thine own defence.
2963	What, rouse thee, man! thy Juliet is alive,
2964	For whose dear sake thou wast but lately dead;
2965	There art thou happy: Tybalt would kill thee,
2966	But thou slew'st Tybalt; there are thou happy too:
2967	The law that threaten'd death becomes thy friend
2968	And turns it to exile; there art thou happy:
2969	A pack of blessings lights up upon thy back;
2970	Happiness courts thee in her best array;
2971	But, like a misbehaved and sullen wench,
2972	Thou pout'st upon thy fortune and thy love:
2973	Take heed, take heed, for such die miserable.
2974	Go, get thee to thy love, as was decreed,
2975	Ascend her chamber, hence and comfort her:
2976	But look thou stay not till the watch be set,
2977	For then thou canst not pass to Mantua;
2978	Where thou shalt live, till we can find a time
2979	To blaze your marriage, reconcile your friends,
2980	Beg pardon of the prince, and call thee back
2981	With twenty hundred thousand times more joy
2982	Than thou went'st forth in lamentation.
2983	Go before, nurse: commend me to thy lady;
2984	And bid her hasten all the house to bed,
2985	Which heavy sorrow makes them apt unto:
2986	Romeo is coming.
2987	
2988	Nurse	O Lord, I could have stay'd here all the night
2989	To hear good counsel: O, what learning is!
2990	My lord, I'll tell my lady you will come.
2991	
2992	ROMEO	Do so, and bid my sweet prepare to chide.
2993	
2994	Nurse	Here, sir, a ring she bid me give you, sir:
2995	Hie you, make haste, for it grows very late.
2996	
2997	[Exit]
2998	
2999	ROMEO	How well my comfort is revived by this!
3000	
3001	FRIAR LAURENCE	Go hence; good night; and here stands all your state:
3002	Either be gone before the watch be set,
3003	Or by the break of day disguised from hence:
3004	Sojourn in Mantua; I'll find out your man,
3005	And he shall signify from time to time
3006	Every good hap to you that chances here:
3007	Give me thy hand; 'tis late: farewell; good night.
3008	
3009	ROMEO	But that a joy past joy calls out on me,
3010	It were a grief, so brief to part with thee: Farewell.

3027	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and PARIS]
3028	
3029	CAPULET	Things have fall'n out, sir, so unluckily,
3030	That we have had no time to move our daughter:
3031	Look you, she loved her kinsman Tybalt dearly,
3032	And so did I:--Well, we were born to die.
3033	'Tis very late, she'll not come down to-night:
3034	I promise you, but for your company,
3035	I would have been a-bed an hour ago.
3036	
3037	PARIS	These times of woe afford no time to woo.
3038	Madam, good night: commend me to your daughter.
3039	
3040	LADY CAPULET	I will, and know her mind early to-morrow;
3041	To-night she is mew'd up to her heaviness.
3042	
3043	CAPULET	Sir Paris, I will make a desperate tender
3044	Of my child's love: I think she will be ruled
3045	In all respects by me; nay, more, I doubt it not.
3046	Wife, go you to her ere you go to bed;
3047	Acquaint her here of my son Paris' love;
3048	And bid her, mark you me, on Wednesday next--
3049	But, soft! what day is this?
3050	
3051	PARIS	Monday, my lord,
3052	
3053	CAPULET	Monday! ha, ha! Well, Wednesday is too soon,
3054	O' Thursday let it be: o' Thursday, tell her,
3055	She shall be married to this noble earl.
3056	Will you be ready? do you like this haste?
3057	We'll keep no great ado,--a friend or two;
3058	For, hark you, Tybalt being slain so late,
3059	It may be thought we held him carelessly,
3060	Being our kinsman, if we revel much:
3061	Therefore we'll have some half a dozen friends,
3062	And there an end. But what say you to Thursday?
3063	
3064	PARIS	My lord, I would that Thursday were to-morrow.
3065	
3066	CAPULET	Well get you gone: o' Thursday be it, then.
3067	Go you to Juliet ere you go to bed,
3068	Prepare her, wife, against this wedding-day.
3069	Farewell, my lord. Light to my chamber, ho!
3070	Afore me! it is so very very late,
3071	That we may call it early by and by.
3072	Good night.

3087	
3088	
3089	[Enter ROMEO and JULIET above, at the window]
3090	
3091	JULIET	Wilt thou be gone? it is not yet near day:
3092	It was the nightingale, and not the lark,
3093	That pierced the fearful hollow of thine ear;
3094	Nightly she sings on yon pomegranate-tree:
3095	Believe me, love, it was the nightingale.
3096	
3097	ROMEO	It was the lark, the herald of the morn,
3098	No nightingale: look, love, what envious streaks
3099	Do lace the severing clouds in yonder east:
3100	Night's candles are burnt out, and jocund day
3101	Stands tiptoe on the misty mountain tops.
3102	I must be gone and live, or stay and die.
3103	
3104	JULIET	Yon light is not day-light, I know it, I:
3105	It is some meteor that the sun exhales,
3106	To be to thee this night a torch-bearer,
3107	And light thee on thy way to Mantua:
3108	Therefore stay yet; thou need'st not to be gone.
3109	
3110	ROMEO	Let me be ta'en, let me be put to death;
3111	I am content, so thou wilt have it so.
3112	I'll say yon grey is not the morning's eye,
3113	'Tis but the pale reflex of Cynthia's brow;
3114	Nor that is not the lark, whose notes do beat
3115	The vaulty heaven so high above our heads:
3116	I have more care to stay than will to go:
3117	Come, death, and welcome! Juliet wills it so.
3118	How is't, my soul? let's talk; it is not day.
3119	
3120	JULIET	It is, it is: hie hence, be gone, away!
3121	It is the lark that sings so out of tune,
3122	Straining harsh discords and unpleasing sharps.
3123	Some say the lark makes sweet division;
3124	This doth not so, for she divideth us:
3125	Some say the lark and loathed toad change eyes,
3126	O, now I would they had changed voices too!
3127	Since arm from arm that voice doth us affray,
3128	Hunting thee hence with hunt's-up to the day,
3129	O, now be gone; more light and light it grows.
3130	
3131	ROMEO	More light and light; more dark and dark our woes!
3132	
3133	[Enter Nurse, to the chamber]
3134	
3135	Nurse	Madam!
3136	
3137	JULIET	Nurse?

3139	Nurse	Your lady mother is coming to your chamber:
3140	The day is broke; be wary, look about.
3141	
3142	[Exit]
3143	
3144	JULIET	Then, window, let day in, and let life out.
3145	
3146	ROMEO	Farewell, farewell! one kiss, and I'll descend.
3147	
3148	[He goeth down]
3149	
3150	JULIET	Art thou gone so? love, lord, ay, husband, friend!
3151	I must hear from thee every day in the hour,
3152	For in a minute there are many days:
3153	O, by this count I shall be much in years
3154	Ere I again behold my Romeo!
3155	
3156	ROMEO	Farewell!
3157	I will omit no opportunity
3158	That may convey my greetings, love, to thee.
3159	
3160	JULIET	O think'st thou we shall ever meet again?
3161	
3162	ROMEO	I doubt it not; and all these woes shall serve
3163	For sweet discourses in our time to come.
3164	
3165	JULIET	O God, I have an ill-divining soul!
3166	Methinks I see thee, now thou art below,
3167	As one dead in the bottom of a tomb:
3168	Either my eyesight fails, or thou look'st pale.
3169	
3170	ROMEO	And trust me, love, in my eye so do you:
3171	Dry sorrow drinks our blood. Adieu, adieu!
3172	
3173	[Exit]
3174	
3175	JULIET	O fortune, fortune! all men call thee fickle:
3176	If thou art fickle, what dost thou with him.
3177	That is renown'd for faith? Be fickle, fortune;
3178	For then, I hope, thou wilt not keep him long,
3179	But send him back.
3180	
3181	LADY CAPULET	[Within]         Ho, daughter! are you up?
3182	
3183	JULIET	Who is't that calls? is it my lady mother?
3184	Is she not down so late, or up so early?
3185	What unaccustom'd cause procures her hither?
3186	
3187	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
3188	
3189	LADY CAPULET	Why, how now, Juliet!
3190	
3191	JULIET	Madam, I am not well.
3192	
3193	LADY CAPULET	Evermore weeping for your cousin's death?
3194	What, wilt thou wash him from his grave with tears?
3195	An if thou couldst, thou couldst not make him live;
3196	Therefore, have done: some grief shows much of love;
3197	But much of grief shows still some want of wit.
3198	
3199	JULIET	Yet let me weep for such a feeling loss.
3200	
3201	LADY CAPULET	So shall you feel the loss, but not the friend
3202	Which you weep for.
3203	
3204	JULIET	Feeling so the loss,
3205	Cannot choose but ever weep the friend.
3206	
3207	LADY CAPULET	Well, girl, thou weep'st not so much for his death,
3208	As that the villain lives which slaughter'd him.
3209	
3210	JULIET	What villain madam?
3211	
3212	LADY CAPULET	That same villain, Romeo.
3213	
3214	JULIET	[Aside]  Villain and he be many miles asunder.--
3215	God Pardon him! I do, with all my heart;
3216	And yet no man like he doth grieve my heart.
3217	
3218	LADY CAPULET	That is, because the traitor murderer lives.
3219	
3220	JULIET	Ay, madam, from the reach of these my hands:
3221	Would none but I might venge my cousin's death!
3222	
3223	LADY CAPULET	We will have vengeance for it, fear thou not:
3224	Then weep no more. I'll send to one in Mantua,
3225	Where that same banish'd runagate doth live,
3226	Shall give him such an unaccustom'd dram,
3227	That he shall soon keep Tybalt company:
3228	And then, I hope, thou wilt be satisfied.
3229	
3230	JULIET	Indeed, I never shall be satisfied
3231	With Romeo, till I behold him--dead--
3232	Is my poor heart for a kinsman vex'd.
3233	Madam, if you could find out but a man
3234	To bear a poison, I would temper it;
3235	That Romeo should, upon receipt thereof,
3236	Soon sleep in quiet. O, how my heart abhors
3237	To hear him named, and cannot come to him.
3238	To wreak the love I bore my cousin
3239	Upon his body that slaughter'd him!
3240	
3241	LADY CAPULET	Find thou the means, and I'll find such a man.
3242	But now I'll tell thee joyful tidings, girl.
3243	
3244	JULIET	And joy comes well in such a needy time:
3245	What are they, I beseech your ladyship?
3246	
3247	LADY CAPULET	Well, well, thou hast a careful father, child;
3248	One who, to put thee from thy heaviness,
3249	Hath sorted out a sudden day of joy,
3250	That thou expect'st not nor I look'd not for.
3251	
3252	JULIET	Madam, in happy time, what day is that?
3253	
3254	LADY CAPULET	Marry, my child, early next Thursday morn,
3255	The gallant, young and noble gentleman,
3256	The County Paris, at Saint Peter's Church,
3257	Shall happily make thee there a joyful bride.
3258	
3259	JULIET	Now, by Saint Peter's Church and Peter too,
3260	He shall not make me there a joyful bride.
3261	I wonder at this haste; that I must wed
3262	Ere he, that should be husband, comes to woo.
3263	I pray you, tell my lord and father, madam,
3264	I will not marry yet; and, when I do, I swear,
3265	It shall be Romeo, whom you know I hate,
3266	Rather than Paris. These are news indeed!
3267	
3268	LADY CAPULET	Here comes your father; tell him so yourself,
3269	And see how he will take it at your hands.
3270	
3271	[Enter CAPULET and Nurse]
3272	
3273	CAPULET	When the sun sets, the air doth drizzle dew;
3274	But for the sunset of my brother's son
3275	It rains downright.
3276	How now! a conduit, girl? what, still in tears?
3277	Evermore showering? In one little body
3278	Thou counterfeit'st a bark, a sea, a wind;
3279	For still thy eyes, which I may call the sea,
3280	Do ebb and flow with tears; the bark thy body is,
3281	Sailing in this salt flood; the winds, thy sighs;
3282	Who, raging with thy tears, and they with them,
3283	Without a sudden calm, will overset
3284	Thy tempest-tossed body. How now, wife!
3285	Have you deliver'd to her our decree?
3286	
3287	LADY CAPULET	Ay, sir; but she will none, she gives you thanks.
3288	I would the fool were married to her grave!
3289	
3290	CAPULET	Soft! take me with you, take me with you, wife.
3291	How! will she none? doth she not give us thanks?
3292	Is she not proud? doth she not count her blest,
3293	Unworthy as she is, that we have wrought
3294	So worthy a gentleman to be her bridegroom?
3295	
3296	JULIET	Not proud, you have; but thankful, that you have:
3297	Proud can I never be of what I hate;
3298	But thankful even for hate, that is meant love.
3299	
3300	CAPULET	How now, how now, chop-logic! What is this?
3301	'Proud,' and 'I thank you,' and 'I thank you not;'
3302	And yet 'not proud,' mistress minion, you,
3303	Thank me no thankings, nor, proud me no prouds,
3304	But fettle your fine joints 'gainst Thursday next,
3305	To go with Paris to Saint Peter's Church,
3306	Or I will drag thee on a hurdle thither.
3307	Out, you green-sickness carrion! out, you baggage!
3308	You tallow-face!
3309	
3310	LADY CAPULET	                  Fie, fie! what, are you mad?
3311	
3312	JULIET	Good father, I beseech you on my knees,
3313	Hear me with patience but to speak a word.
3314	
3315	CAPULET	Hang thee, young baggage! disobedient wretch!
3316	I tell thee what: get thee to church o' Thursday,
3317	Or never after look me in the face:
3318	Speak not, reply not, do not answer me;
3319	My fingers itch. Wife, we scarce thought us blest
3320	That God had lent us but this only child;
3321	But now I see this one is one too much,
3322	And that we have a curse in having her:
3323	Out on her, hilding!
3324	
3325	Nurse	God in heaven bless her!
3326	You are to blame, my lord, to rate her so.
3327	
3328	CAPULET	And why, my lady wisdom? hold your tongue,
3329	Good prudence; smatter with your gossips, go.
3330	
3331	Nurse	I speak no treason.
3332	
3333	CAPULET	O, God ye god-den.
3334	
3335	Nurse	May not one speak?
3336	
3337	CAPULET	                  Peace, you mumbling fool!
3338	Utter your gravity o'er a gossip's bowl;
3339	For here we need it not.
3340	
3341	LADY CAPULET	You are too hot.
3342	
3343	CAPULET	God's bread! it makes me mad:
3344	Day, night, hour, tide, time, work, play,
3345	Alone, in company, still my care hath been
3346	To have her match'd: and having now provided
3347	A gentleman of noble parentage,
3348	Of fair demesnes, youthful, and nobly train'd,
3349	Stuff'd, as they say, with honourable parts,
3350	Proportion'd as one's thought would wish a man;
3351	And then to have a wretched puling fool,
3352	A whining mammet, in her fortune's tender,
3353	To answer 'I'll not wed; I cannot love,
3354	I am too young; I pray you, pardon me.'
3355	But, as you will not wed, I'll pardon you:
3356	Graze where you will you shall not house with me:
3357	Look to't, think on't, I do not use to jest.
3358	Thursday is near; lay hand on heart, advise:
3359	An you be mine, I'll give you to my friend;
3360	And you be not, hang, beg, starve, die in
3361	the streets,
3362	For, by my soul, I'll ne'er acknowledge thee,
3363	Nor what is mine shall never do thee good:
3364	Trust to't, bethink you; I'll not be forsworn.
3365	
3366	[Exit]
3367	
3368	JULIET	Is there no pity sitting in the clouds,
3369	That sees into the bottom of my grief?
3370	O, sweet my mother, cast me not away!
3371	Delay this marriage for a month, a week;
3372	Or, if you do not, make the bridal bed
3373	In that dim monument where Tybalt lies.
3374	
3375	LADY CAPULET	Talk not to me, for I'll not speak a word:
3376	Do as thou wilt, for I have done with thee.
3377	
3378	[Exit]
3379	
3380	JULIET	O God!--O nurse, how shall this be prevented?
3381	My husband is on earth, my faith in heaven;
3382	How shall that faith return again to earth,
3383	Unless that husband send it me from heaven
3384	By leaving earth? comfort me, counsel me.
3385	Alack, alack, that heaven should practise stratagems
3386	Upon so soft a subject as myself!
3387	What say'st thou? hast thou not a word of joy?
3388	Some comfort, nurse.
3389	
3390	Nurse	Faith, here it is.
3391	Romeo is banish'd; and all the world to nothing,
3392	That he dares ne'er come back to challenge you;
3393	Or, if he do, it needs must be by stealth.
3394	Then, since the case so stands as now it doth,
3395	I think it best you married with the county.
3396	O, he's a lovely gentleman!
3397	Romeo's a dishclout to him: an eagle, madam,
3398	Hath not so green, so quick, so fair an eye
3399	As Paris hath. Beshrew my very heart,
3400	I think you are happy in this second match,
3401	For it excels your first: or if it did not,
3402	Your first is dead; or 'twere as good he were,
3403	As living here and you no use of him.
3404	
3405	JULIET	Speakest thou from thy heart?
3406	
3407	Nurse	And from my soul too;
3408	Or else beshrew them both.
3409	
3410	JULIET	Amen!
3411	
3412	Nurse	What?
3413	
3414	JULIET	Well, thou hast comforted me marvellous much.
3415	Go in: and tell my lady I am gone,
3416	Having displeased my father, to Laurence' cell,
3417	To make confession and to be absolved.
3418	
3419	Nurse	Marry, I will; and this is wisely done.
3420	
3421	[Exit]
3422	
3423	JULIET	Ancient damnation! O most wicked fiend!
3424	Is it more sin to wish me thus forsworn,
3425	Or to dispraise my lord with that same tongue
3426	Which she hath praised him with above compare
3427	So many thousand times? Go, counsellor;
3428	Thou and my bosom henceforth shall be twain.
3429	I'll to the friar, to know his remedy:
3430	If all else fail, myself have power to die.

3444	SCENE I	Friar Laurence's cell.
3445	
3446	
3447	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE and PARIS]
3448	
3449	FRIAR LAURENCE	On Thursday, sir? the time is very short.
3450	
3451	PARIS	My father Capulet will have it so;
3452	And I am nothing slow to slack his haste.
3453	
3454	FRIAR LAURENCE	You say you do not know the lady's mind:
3455	Uneven is the course, I like it not.
3456	
3457	PARIS	Immoderately she weeps for Tybalt's death,
3458	And therefore have I little talk'd of love;
3459	For Venus smiles not in a house of tears.
3460	Now, sir, her father counts it dangerous
3461	That she doth give her sorrow so much sway,
3462	And in his wisdom hastes our marriage,
3463	To stop the inundation of her tears;
3464	Which, too much minded by herself alone,
3465	May be put from her by society:
3466	Now do you know the reason of this haste.
3467	
3468	FRIAR LAURENCE	[Aside]  I would I knew not why it should be slow'd.
3469	Look, sir, here comes the lady towards my cell.
3470	
3471	[Enter JULIET]
3472	
3473	PARIS	Happily met, my lady and my wife!
3474	
3475	JULIET	That may be, sir, when I may be a wife.
3476	
3477	PARIS	That may be must be, love, on Thursday next.
3478	
3479	JULIET	What must be shall be.
3480	
3481	FRIAR LAURENCE	That's a certain text.
3482	
3483	PARIS	Come you to make confession to this father?
3484	
3485	JULIET	To answer that, I should confess to you.
3486	
3487	PARIS	Do not deny to him that you love me.
3488	
3489	JULIET	I will confess to you that I love him.
3490	
3491	PARIS	So will ye, I am sure, that you love me.
3492	
3493	JULIET	If I do so, it will be of more price,
3494	Being spoke behind your back, than to your face.
3495	
3496	PARIS	Poor soul, thy face is much abused with tears.
3497	
3498	JULIET	The tears have got small victory by that;
3499	For it was bad enough before their spite.
3500	
3501	PARIS	Thou wrong'st it, more than tears, with that report.
3502	
3503	JULIET	That is no slander, sir, which is a truth;
3504	And what I spake, I spake it to my face.
3505	
3506	PARIS	Thy face is mine, and thou hast slander'd it.
3507	
3508	JULIET	It may be so, for it is not mine own.
3509	Are you at leisure, holy father, now;
3510	Or shall I come to you at evening mass?
3511	
3512	FRIAR LAURENCE	My leisure serves me, pensive daughter, now.
3513	My lord, we must entreat the time alone.
3514	
3515	PARIS	God shield I should disturb devotion!
3516	Juliet, on Thursday early will I rouse ye:
3517	Till then, adieu; and keep this holy kiss.
3518	
3519	[Exit]
3520	
3521	JULIET	O shut the door! and when thou hast done so,
3522	Come weep with me; past hope, past cure, past help!
3523	
3524	FRIAR LAURENCE	Ah, Juliet, I already know thy grief;
3525	It strains me past the compass of my wits:
3526	I hear thou must, and nothing may prorogue it,
3527	On Thursday next be married to this county.
3528	
3529	JULIET	Tell me not, friar, that thou hear'st of this,
3530	Unless thou tell me how I may prevent it:
3531	If, in thy wisdom, thou canst give no help,
3532	Do thou but call my resolution wise,
3533	And with this knife I'll help it presently.
3534	God join'd my heart and Romeo's, thou our hands;
3535	And ere this hand, by thee to Romeo seal'd,
3536	Shall be the label to another deed,
3537	Or my true heart with treacherous revolt
3538	Turn to another, this shall slay them both:
3539	Therefore, out of thy long-experienced time,
3540	Give me some present counsel, or, behold,
3541	'Twixt my extremes and me this bloody knife
3542	Shall play the umpire, arbitrating that
3543	Which the commission of thy years and art
3544	Could to no issue of true honour bring.
3545	Be not so long to speak; I long to die,
3546	If what thou speak'st speak not of remedy.
3547	
3548	FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, daughter: I do spy a kind of hope,
3549	Which craves as desperate an execution.
3550	As that is desperate which we would prevent.
3551	If, rather than to marry County Paris,
3552	Thou hast the strength of will to slay thyself,
3553	Then is it likely thou wilt undertake
3554	A thing like death to chide away this shame,
3555	That copest with death himself to scape from it:
3556	And, if thou darest, I'll give thee remedy.
3557	
3558	JULIET	O, bid me leap, rather than marry Paris,
3559	From off the battlements of yonder tower;
3560	Or walk in thievish ways; or bid me lurk
3561	Where serpents are; chain me with roaring bears;
3562	Or shut me nightly in a charnel-house,
3563	O'er-cover'd quite with dead men's rattling bones,
3564	With reeky shanks and yellow chapless skulls;
3565	Or bid me go into a new-made grave
3566	And hide me with a dead man in his shroud;
3567	Things that, to hear them told, have made me tremble;
3568	And I will do it without fear or doubt,
3569	To live an unstain'd wife to my sweet love.
3570	
3571	FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold, then; go home, be merry, give consent
3572	To marry Paris: Wednesday is to-morrow:
3573	To-morrow night look that thou lie alone;
3574	Let not thy nurse lie with thee in thy chamber:
3575	Take thou this vial, being then in bed,
3576	And this distilled liquor drink thou off;
3577	When presently through all thy veins shall run
3578	A cold and drowsy humour, for no pulse
3579	Shall keep his native progress, but surcease:
3580	No warmth, no breath, shall testify thou livest;
3581	The roses in thy lips and cheeks shall fade
3582	To paly ashes, thy eyes' windows fall,
3583	Like death, when he shuts up the day of life;
3584	Each part, deprived of supple government,
3585	Shall, stiff and stark and cold, appear like death:
3586	And in this borrow'd likeness of shrunk death
3587	Thou shalt continue two and forty hours,
3588	And then awake as from a pleasant sleep.
3589	Now, when the bridegroom in the morning comes
3590	To rouse thee from thy bed, there art thou dead:
3591	Then, as the manner of our country is,
3592	In thy best robes uncover'd on the bier
3593	Thou shalt be borne to that same ancient vault
3594	Where all the kindred of the Capulets lie.
3595	In the mean time, against thou shalt awake,
3596	Shall Romeo by my letters know our drift,
3597	And hither shall he come: and he and I
3598	Will watch thy waking, and that very night
3599	Shall Romeo bear thee hence to Mantua.
3600	And this shall free thee from this present shame;
3601	If no inconstant toy, nor womanish fear,
3602	Abate thy valour in the acting it.
3603	
3604	JULIET	Give me, give me! O, tell not me of fear!
3605	
3606	FRIAR LAURENCE	Hold; get you gone, be strong and prosperous
3607	In this resolve: I'll send a friar with speed
3608	To Mantua, with my letters to thy lord.
3609	
3610	JULIET	Love give me strength! and strength shall help afford.
3611	Farewell, dear father!

3637	Second Servant	You shall have none ill, sir; for I'll try if they
3638	can lick their fingers.
3639	
3640	CAPULET	How canst thou try them so?
3641	
3642	Second Servant	Marry, sir, 'tis an ill cook that cannot lick his

3664	JULIET	Where I have learn'd me to repent the sin
3665	Of disobedient opposition
3666	To you and your behests, and am enjoin'd
3667	By holy Laurence to fall prostrate here,
3668	And beg your pardon: pardon, I beseech you!
3669	Henceforward I am ever ruled by you.
3670	
3671	CAPULET	Send for the county; go tell him of this:
3672	I'll have this knot knit up to-morrow morning.
3673	
3674	JULIET	I met the youthful lord at Laurence' cell;
3675	And gave him what becomed love I might,
3676	Not step o'er the bounds of modesty.
3677	
3678	CAPULET	Why, I am glad on't; this is well: stand up:
3679	This is as't should be. Let me see the county;
3680	Ay, marry, go, I say, and fetch him hither.
3681	Now, afore God! this reverend holy friar,
3682	Our whole city is much bound to him.
3683	
3684	JULIET	Nurse, will you go with me into my closet,
3685	To help me sort such needful ornaments
3686	As you think fit to furnish me to-morrow?
3687	
3688	LADY CAPULET	No, not till Thursday; there is time enough.
3689	
3690	CAPULET	Go, nurse, go with her: we'll to church to-morrow.
3691	
3692	[Exeunt JULIET and Nurse]
3693	
3694	LADY  CAPULET	We shall be short in our provision:
3695	'Tis now near night.
3696	
3697	CAPULET	Tush, I will stir about,
3698	And all things shall be well, I warrant thee, wife:
3699	Go thou to Juliet, help to deck up her;
3700	I'll not to bed to-night; let me alone;
3701	I'll play the housewife for this once. What, ho!
3702	They are all forth. Well, I will walk myself
3703	To County Paris, to prepare him up
3704	Against to-morrow: my heart is wondrous light,
3705	Since this same wayward girl is so reclaim'd.

3722	[Enter JULIET and Nurse]
3723	
3724	JULIET	Ay, those attires are best: but, gentle nurse,
3725	I pray thee, leave me to myself to-night,
3726	For I have need of many orisons
3727	To move the heavens to smile upon my state,
3728	Which, well thou know'st, is cross, and full of sin.
3729	
3730	[Enter LADY CAPULET]
3731	
3732	LADY CAPULET	What, are you busy, ho? need you my help?
3733	
3734	JULIET	No, madam; we have cull'd such necessaries
3735	As are behoveful for our state to-morrow:
3736	So please you, let me now be left alone,
3737	And let the nurse this night sit up with you;
3738	For, I am sure, you have your hands full all,
3739	In this so sudden business.
3740	
3741	LADY CAPULET	Good night:
3742	Get thee to bed, and rest; for thou hast need.
3743	
3744	[Exeunt LADY CAPULET and Nurse]
3745	
3746	JULIET	Farewell! God knows when we shall meet again.
3747	I have a faint cold fear thrills through my veins,
3748	That almost freezes up the heat of life:
3749	I'll call them back again to comfort me:
3750	Nurse! What should she do here?
3751	My dismal scene I needs must act alone.
3752	Come, vial.
3753	What if this mixture do not work at all?
3754	Shall I be married then to-morrow morning?
3755	No, no: this shall forbid it: lie thou there.
3756	
3757	[Laying down her dagger]
3758	
3759	What if it be a poison, which the friar
3760	Subtly hath minister'd to have me dead,
3761	Lest in this marriage he should be dishonour'd,
3762	Because he married me before to Romeo?
3763	I fear it is: and yet, methinks, it should not,
3764	For he hath still been tried a holy man.
3765	How if, when I am laid into the tomb,
3766	I wake before the time that Romeo
3767	Come to redeem me? there's a fearful point!
3768	Shall I not, then, be stifled in the vault,
3769	To whose foul mouth no healthsome air breathes in,
3770	And there die strangled ere my Romeo comes?
3771	Or, if I live, is it not very like,
3772	The horrible conceit of death and night,
3773	Together with the terror of the place,--
3774	As in a vault, an ancient receptacle,
3775	Where, for these many hundred years, the bones
3776	Of all my buried ancestors are packed:
3777	Where bloody Tybalt, yet but green in earth,
3778	Lies festering in his shroud; where, as they say,
3779	At some hours in the night spirits resort;--
3780	Alack, alack, is it not like that I,
3781	So early waking, what with loathsome smells,
3782	And shrieks like mandrakes' torn out of the earth,
3783	That living mortals, hearing them, run mad:--
3784	O, if I wake, shall I not be distraught,
3785	Environed with all these hideous fears?
3786	And madly play with my forefather's joints?
3787	And pluck the mangled Tybalt from his shroud?
3788	And, in this rage, with some great kinsman's bone,
3789	As with a club, dash out my desperate brains?
3790	O, look! methinks I see my cousin's ghost
3791	Seeking out Romeo, that did spit his body
3792	Upon a rapier's point: stay, Tybalt, stay!
3793	Romeo, I come! this do I drink to thee.

3820	Look to the baked meats, good Angelica:
3821	Spare not for the cost.
3822	
3823	Nurse	Go, you cot-quean, go,
3824	Get you to bed; faith, You'll be sick to-morrow
3825	For this night's watching.
3826	
3827	CAPULET	No, not a whit: what! I have watch'd ere now
3828	All night for lesser cause, and ne'er been sick.
3829	
3830	LADY CAPULET	Ay, you have been a mouse-hunt in your time;

3853	And never trouble Peter for the matter.

3856	
3857	CAPULET	Mass, and well said; a merry whoreson, ha!

3891	Why, lamb! why, lady! fie, you slug-a-bed!
3892	Why, love, I say! madam! sweet-heart! why, bride!
3893	What, not a word? you take your pennyworths now;
3894	Sleep for a week; for the next night, I warrant,
3895	The County Paris hath set up his rest,
3896	That you shall rest but little. God forgive me,
3897	Marry, and amen, how sound is she asleep!
3898	I must needs wake her. Madam, madam, madam!
3899	Ay, let the county take you in your bed;
3900	He'll fright you up, i' faith. Will it not be?

3902	[Undraws the curtains]

3930	LADY CAPULET	Alack the day, she's dead, she's dead, she's dead!
3931	
3932	CAPULET	Ha! let me see her: out, alas! she's cold:
3933	Her blood is settled, and her joints are stiff;
3934	Life and these lips have long been separated:
3935	Death lies on her like an untimely frost
3936	Upon the sweetest flower of all the field.
3937	
3938	Nurse	O lamentable day!
3939	
3940	LADY CAPULET	                  O woful time!
3941	
3942	CAPULET	Death, that hath ta'en her hence to make me wail,
3943	Ties up my tongue, and will not let me speak.
3944

3946	
3947	FRIAR LAURENCE	Come, is the bride ready to go to church?
3948	
3949	CAPULET	Ready to go, but never to return.
3950	O son! the night before thy wedding-day
3951	Hath Death lain with thy wife. There she lies,
3952	Flower as she was, deflowered by him.
3953	Death is my son-in-law, Death is my heir;
3954	My daughter he hath wedded: I will die,
3955	And leave him all; life, living, all is Death's.
3956	
3957	PARIS	Have I thought long to see this morning's face,
3958	And doth it give me such a sight as this?
3959	
3960	LADY CAPULET	Accursed, unhappy, wretched, hateful day!
3961	Most miserable hour that e'er time saw
3962	In lasting labour of his pilgrimage!
3963	But one, poor one, one poor and loving child,
3964	But one thing to rejoice and solace in,
3965	And cruel death hath catch'd it from my sight!
3966	
3967	Nurse	O woe! O woful, woful, woful day!
3968	Most lamentable day, most woful day,
3969	That ever, ever, I did yet behold!
3970	O day! O day! O day! O hateful day!
3971	Never was seen so black a day as this:
3972	O woful day, O woful day!
3973	
3974	PARIS	Beguiled, divorced, wronged, spited, slain!
3975	Most detestable death, by thee beguil'd,
3976	By cruel cruel thee quite overthrown!
3977	O love! O life! not life, but love in death!
3978	
3979	CAPULET	Despised, distressed, hated, martyr'd, kill'd!
3980	Uncomfortable time, why camest thou now
3981	To murder, murder our solemnity?
3982	O child! O child! my soul, and not my child!
3983	Dead art thou! Alack! my child is dead;
3984	And with my child my joys are buried.
3985	
3986	FRIAR LAURENCE	Peace, ho, for shame! confusion's cure lives not
3987	In these confusions. Heaven and yourself
3988	Had part in this fair maid; now heaven hath all,
3989	And all the better is it for the maid:
3990	Your part in her you could not keep from death,
3991	But heaven keeps his part in eternal life.
3992	The most you sought was her promotion;
3993	For 'twas your heaven she should be advanced:
3994	And weep ye now, seeing she is advanced
3995	Above the clouds, as high as heaven itself?
3996	O, in this love, you love your child so ill,
3997	That you run mad, seeing that she is well:
3998	She's not well married that lives married long;
3999	But she's best married that dies married young.
4000	Dry up your tears, and stick your rosemary
4001	On this fair corse; and, as the custom is,
4002	In all her best array bear her to church:
4003	For though fond nature bids us an lament,
4004	Yet nature's tears are reason's merriment.
4005	
4006	CAPULET	All things that we ordained festival,
4007	Turn from their office to black funeral;
4008	Our instruments to melancholy bells,
4009	Our wedding cheer to a sad burial feast,
4010	Our solemn hymns to sullen dirges change,
4011	Our bridal flowers serve for a buried corse,
4012	And all things change them to the contrary.
4013	
4014	FRIAR LAURENCE	Sir, go you in; and, madam, go with him;
4015	And go, Sir Paris; every one prepare
4016	To follow this fair corse unto her grave:
4017	The heavens do lour upon you for some ill;
4018	Move them no more by crossing their high will.
4019

4022	First Musician	Faith, we may put up our pipes, and be gone.

4032	
4033	PETER	Musicians, O, musicians, 'Heart's ease, Heart's
4034	ease:' O, an you will have me live, play 'Heart's ease.'
4035	
4036	First Musician	Why 'Heart's ease?'
4037	
4038	PETER	O, musicians, because my heart itself plays 'My
4039	heart is full of woe:' O, play me some merry dump,
4040	to comfort me.
4041	
4042	First Musician	Not a dump we; 'tis no time to play now.
4043	
4044	PETER	You will not, then?
4045	
4046	First Musician	No.
4047	
4048	PETER	I will then give it you soundly.
4049	
4050	First Musician	What will you give us?
4051	
4052	PETER	No money, on my faith, but the gleek;
4053	I will give you the minstrel.
4054	
4055	First Musician	Then I will give you the serving-creature.
4056	
4057	PETER	Then will I lay the serving-creature's dagger on
4058	your pate. I will carry no crotchets: I'll re you,
4059	I'll fa you; do you note me?
4060	
4061	First Musician	An you re us and fa us, you note us.
4062	
4063	Second Musician	Pray you, put up your dagger, and put out your wit.
4064	
4065	PETER	Then have at you with my wit! I will dry-beat you
4066	with an iron wit, and put up my iron dagger. Answer
4067	me like men:
4068	'When griping grief the heart doth wound,
4069	And doleful dumps the mind oppress,
4070	Then music with her silver sound'--
4071	why 'silver sound'? why 'music with her silver
4072	sound'? What say you, Simon Catling?
4073	
4074	Musician	Marry, sir, because silver hath a sweet sound.
4075	
4076	PETER	Pretty! What say you, Hugh Rebeck?
4077	
4078	Second Musician	I say 'silver sound,' because musicians sound for silver.
4079	
4080	PETER	Pretty too! What say you, James Soundpost?
4081	
4082	Third Musician	Faith, I know not what to say.
4083	
4084	PETER	O, I cry you mercy; you are the singer: I will say
4085	for you. It is 'music with her silver sound,'
4086	because musicians have no gold for sounding:
4087	'Then music with her silver sound
4088	With speedy help doth lend redress.'
4089	
4090	[Exit]
4091	
4092	First Musician	What a pestilent knave is this same!

4112	[Enter ROMEO]
4113	
4114	ROMEO	If I may trust the flattering truth of sleep,
4115	My dreams presage some joyful news at hand:
4116	My bosom's lord sits lightly in his throne;
4117	And all this day an unaccustom'd spirit
4118	Lifts me above the ground with cheerful thoughts.
4119	I dreamt my lady came and found me dead--
4120	Strange dream, that gives a dead man leave
4121	to think!--
4122	And breathed such life with kisses in my lips,
4123	That I revived, and was an emperor.
4124	Ah me! how sweet is love itself possess'd,
4125	When but love's shadows are so rich in joy!
4126	
4127	[Enter BALTHASAR, booted]
4128	
4129	News from Verona!--How now, Balthasar!
4130	Dost thou not bring me letters from the friar?
4131	How doth my lady? Is my father well?
4132	How fares my Juliet? that I ask again;
4133	For nothing can be ill, if she be well.
4134	
4135	BALTHASAR	Then she is well, and nothing can be ill:
4136	Her body sleeps in Capel's monument,
4137	And her immortal part with angels lives.
4138	I saw her laid low in her kindred's vault,
4139	And presently took post to tell it you:
4140	O, pardon me for bringing these ill news,
4141	Since you did leave it for my office, sir.
4142	
4143	ROMEO	Is it even so? then I defy you, stars!
4144	Thou know'st my lodging: get me ink and paper,
4145	And hire post-horses; I will hence to-night.
4146	
4147	BALTHASAR	I do beseech you, sir, have patience:
4148	Your looks are pale and wild, and do import
4149	Some misadventure.
4150	
4151	ROMEO	                  Tush, thou art deceived:
4152	Leave me, and do the thing I bid thee do.
4153	Hast thou no letters to me from the friar?
4154	
4155	BALTHASAR	No, my good lord.
4156	
4157	ROMEO	                  No matter: get thee gone,
4158	And hire those horses; I'll be with thee straight.
4159	
4160	[Exit BALTHASAR]
4161	
4162	Well, Juliet, I will lie with thee to-night.
4163	Let's see for means: O mischief, thou art swift
4164	To enter in the thoughts of desperate men!
4165	I do remember an apothecary,--
4166	And hereabouts he dwells,--which late I noted
4167	In tatter'd weeds, with overwhelming brows,
4168	Culling of simples; meagre were his looks,
4169	Sharp misery had worn him to the bones:
4170	And in his needy shop a tortoise hung,
4171	An alligator stuff'd, and other skins
4172	Of ill-shaped fishes; and about his shelves
4173	A beggarly account of empty boxes,
4174	Green earthen pots, bladders and musty seeds,
4175	Remnants of packthread and old cakes of roses,
4176	Were thinly scatter'd, to make up a show.
4177	Noting this penury, to myself I said
4178	'An if a man did need a poison now,
4179	Whose sale is present death in Mantua,
4180	Here lives a caitiff wretch would sell it him.'
4181	O, this same thought did but forerun my need;
4182	And this same needy man must sell it me.
4183	As I remember, this should be the house.
4184	Being holiday, the beggar's shop is shut.
4185	What, ho! apothecary!
4186	
4187	[Enter Apothecary]
4188	
4189	Apothecary	Who calls so loud?
4190	
4191	ROMEO	Come hither, man. I see that thou art poor:
4192	Hold, there is forty ducats: let me have
4193	A dram of poison, such soon-speeding gear
4194	As will disperse itself through all the veins
4195	That the life-weary taker may fall dead
4196	And that the trunk may be discharged of breath
4197	As violently as hasty powder fired
4198	Doth hurry from the fatal cannon's womb.
4199	
4200	Apothecary	Such mortal drugs I have; but Mantua's law
4201	Is death to any he that utters them.
4202	
4203	ROMEO	Art thou so bare and full of wretchedness,
4204	And fear'st to die? famine is in thy cheeks,
4205	Need and oppression starveth in thine eyes,
4206	Contempt and beggary hangs upon thy back;
4207	The world is not thy friend nor the world's law;
4208	The world affords no law to make thee rich;
4209	Then be not poor, but break it, and take this.
4210	
4211	Apothecary	My poverty, but not my will, consents.
4212	
4213	ROMEO	I pay thy poverty, and not thy will.
4214	
4215	Apothecary	Put this in any liquid thing you will,
4216	And drink it off; and, if you had the strength
4217	Of twenty men, it would dispatch you straight.
4218	
4219	ROMEO	There is thy gold, worse poison to men's souls,
4220	Doing more murders in this loathsome world,
4221	Than these poor compounds that thou mayst not sell.
4222	I sell thee poison; thou hast sold me none.
4223	Farewell: buy food, and get thyself in flesh.
4224	Come, cordial and not poison, go with me
4225	To Juliet's grave; for there must I use thee.

4237	
4238	
4239	SCENE II	Friar Laurence's cell.
4240	
4241	
4242	[Enter FRIAR JOHN]
4243	
4244	FRIAR JOHN	Holy Franciscan friar! brother, ho!
4245	
4246	[Enter FRIAR LAURENCE]
4247	
4248	FRIAR LAURENCE	This same should be the voice of Friar John.
4249	Welcome from Mantua: what says Romeo?
4250	Or, if his mind be writ, give me his letter.
4251	
4252	FRIAR JOHN	Going to find a bare-foot brother out
4253	One of our order, to associate me,
4254	Here in this city visiting the sick,
4255	And finding him, the searchers of the town,
4256	Suspecting that we both were in a house
4257	Where the infectious pestilence did reign,
4258	Seal'd up the doors, and would not let us forth;
4259	So that my speed to Mantua there was stay'd.
4260	
4261	FRIAR LAURENCE	Who bare my letter, then, to Romeo?
4262	
4263	FRIAR JOHN	I could not send it,--here it is again,--
4264	Nor get a messenger to bring it thee,
4265	So fearful were they of infection.
4266	
4267	FRIAR LAURENCE	Unhappy fortune! by my brotherhood,
4268	The letter was not nice but full of charge
4269	Of dear import, and the neglecting it
4270	May do much danger. Friar John, go hence;
4271	Get me an iron crow, and bring it straight
4272	Unto my cell.
4273	
4274	FRIAR JOHN	Brother, I'll go and bring it thee.
4275	
4276	[Exit]
4277	
4278	FRIAR LAURENCE	Now must I to the monument alone;
4279	Within three hours will fair Juliet wake:
4280	She will beshrew me much that Romeo
4281	Hath had no notice of these accidents;
4282	But I will write again to Mantua,
4283	And keep her at my cell till Romeo come;
4284	Poor living corse, closed in a dead man's tomb!
4285

4294	ACT V
4295	
4296	
4297	
4298	SCENE III	A churchyard; in it a tomb belonging to the Capulets.
4299	
4300	
4301	[Enter PARIS, and his Page bearing flowers and a torch]
4302	
4303	PARIS	Give me thy torch, boy: hence, and stand aloof:
4304	Yet put it out, for I would not be seen.
4305	Under yond yew-trees lay thee all along,
4306	Holding thine ear close to the hollow ground;
4307	So shall no foot upon the churchyard tread,
4308	Being loose, unfirm, with digging up of graves,
4309	But thou shalt hear it: whistle then to me,
4310	As signal that thou hear'st something approach.
4311	Give me those flowers. Do as I bid thee, go.
4312	
4313	PAGE	[Aside]  I am almost afraid to stand alone
4314	Here in the churchyard; yet I will adventure.
4315	
4316	[Retires]
4317	
4318	PARIS	Sweet flower, with flowers thy bridal bed I strew,--
4319	O woe! thy canopy is dust and stones;--
4320	Which with sweet water nightly I will dew,
4321	Or, wanting that, with tears distill'd by moans:
4322	The obsequies that I for thee will keep
4323	Nightly shall be to strew thy grave and weep.
4324	
4325	[The Page whistles]
4326	
4327	The boy gives warning something doth approach.
4328	What cursed foot wanders this way to-night,
4329	To cross my obsequies and true love's rite?
4330	What with a torch! muffle me, night, awhile.
4331	
4332	[Retires]
4333	
4334	[Enter ROMEO and BALTHASAR, with a torch,
4335	mattock, &c]
4336	
4337	ROMEO	Give me that mattock and the wrenching iron.
4338	Hold, take this letter; early in the morning
4339	See thou deliver it to my lord and father.
4340	Give me the light: upon thy life, I charge thee,
4341	Whate'er thou hear'st or seest, stand all aloof,
4342	And do not interrupt me in my course.
4343	Why I descend into this bed of death,
4344	Is partly to behold my lady's face;
4345	But chiefly to take thence from her dead finger
4346	A precious ring, a ring that I must use
4347	In dear employment: therefore hence, be gone:
4348	But if thou, jealous, dost return to pry
4349	In what I further shall intend to do,
4350	By heaven, I will tear thee joint by joint
4351	And strew this hungry churchyard with thy limbs:
4352	The time and my intents are savage-wild,
4353	More fierce and more inexorable far
4354	Than empty tigers or the roaring sea.
4355	
4356	BALTHASAR	I will be gone, sir, and not trouble you.
4357	
4358	ROMEO	So shalt thou show me friendship. Take thou that:
4359	Live, and be prosperous: and farewell, good fellow.
4360	
4361	BALTHASAR	[Aside]  For all this same, I'll hide me hereabout:
4362	His looks I fear, and his intents I doubt.
4363	
4364	[Retires]
4365	
4366	ROMEO	Thou detestable maw, thou womb of death,
4367	Gorged with the dearest morsel of the earth,
4368	Thus I enforce thy rotten jaws to open,
4369	And, in despite, I'll cram thee with more food!
4370	
4371	[Opens the tomb]
4372	
4373	PARIS	This is that banish'd haughty Montague,
4374	That murder'd my love's cousin, with which grief,
4375	It is supposed, the fair creature died;
4376	And here is come to do some villanous shame
4377	To the dead bodies: I will apprehend him.
4378	
4379	[Comes forward]
4380	
4381	Stop thy unhallow'd toil, vile Montague!
4382	Can vengeance be pursued further than death?
4383	Condemned villain, I do apprehend thee:
4384	Obey, and go with me; for thou must die.
4385	
4386	ROMEO	I must indeed; and therefore came I hither.
4387	Good gentle youth, tempt not a desperate man;
4388	Fly hence, and leave me: think upon these gone;
4389	Let them affright thee. I beseech thee, youth,
4390	Put not another sin upon my head,
4391	By urging me to fury: O, be gone!
4392	By heaven, I love thee better than myself;
4393	For I come hither arm'd against myself:
4394	Stay not, be gone; live, and hereafter say,
4395	A madman's mercy bade thee run away.
4396	
4397	PARIS	I do defy thy conjurations,
4398	And apprehend thee for a felon here.
4399	
4400	ROMEO	Wilt thou provoke me? then have at thee, boy!
4401	
4402	[They fight]
4403	
4404	PAGE	O Lord, they fight! I will go call the watch.
4405	
4406	[Exit]
4407	
4408	PARIS	O, I am slain!
4409	
4410	[Falls]
4411	
4412	If thou be merciful,
4413	Open the tomb, lay me with Juliet.
4414	
4415	[Dies]
4416	
4417	ROMEO	In faith, I will. Let me peruse this face.
4418	Mercutio's kinsman, noble County Paris!
4419	What said my man, when my betossed soul
4420	Did not attend him as we rode? I think
4421	He told me Paris should have married Juliet:
4422	Said he not so? or did I dream it so?
4423	Or am I mad, hearing him talk of Juliet,
4424	To think it was so? O, give me thy hand,
4425	One writ with me in sour misfortune's book!
4426	I'll bury thee in a triumphant grave;
4427	A grave? O no! a lantern, slaughter'd youth,
4428	For here lies Juliet, and her beauty makes
4429	This vault a feasting presence full of light.
4430	Death, lie thou there, by a dead man interr'd.
4431	
4432	[Laying PARIS in the tomb]
4433	
4434	How oft when men are at the point of death
4435	Have they been merry! which their keepers call
4436	A lightning before death: O, how may I
4437	Call this a lightning? O my love! my wife!
4438	Death, that hath suck'd the honey of thy breath,
4439	Hath had no power yet upon thy beauty:
4440	Thou art not conquer'd; beauty's ensign yet
4441	Is crimson in thy lips and in thy cheeks,
4442	And death's pale flag is not advanced there.
4443	Tybalt, liest thou there in thy bloody sheet?
4444	O, what more favour can I do to thee,
4445	Than with that hand that cut thy youth in twain
4446	To sunder his that was thine enemy?
4447	Forgive me, cousin! Ah, dear Juliet,
4448	Why art thou yet so fair? shall I believe
4449	That unsubstantial death is amorous,
4450	And that the lean abhorred monster keeps
4451	Thee here in dark to be his paramour?
4452	For fear of that, I still will stay with thee;
4453	And never from this palace of dim night
4454	Depart again: here, here will I remain
4455	With worms that are thy chamber-maids; O, here
4456	Will I set up my everlasting rest,
4457	And shake the yoke of inauspicious stars
4458	From this world-wearied flesh. Eyes, look your last!
4459	Arms, take your last embrace! and, lips, O you
4460	The doors of breath, seal with a righteous kiss
4461	A dateless bargain to engrossing death!
4462	Come, bitter conduct, come, unsavoury guide!
4463	Thou desperate pilot, now at once run on
4464	The dashing rocks thy sea-sick weary bark!
4465	Here's to my love!
4466	
4467	[Drinks]
4468	
4469	O true apothecary!
4470	Thy drugs are quick. Thus with a kiss I die.
4471	
4472	[Dies]
4473	
4474	[Enter, at the other end of the churchyard, FRIAR
4475	LAURENCE, with a lantern, crow, and spade]
4476	
4477	FRIAR LAURENCE	Saint Francis be my speed! how oft to-night
4478	Have my old feet stumbled at graves! Who's there?
4479	
4480	BALTHASAR	Here's one, a friend, and one that knows you well.
4481	
4482	FRIAR LAURENCE	Bliss be upon you! Tell me, good my friend,
4483	What torch is yond, that vainly lends his light
4484	To grubs and eyeless skulls? as I discern,
4485	It burneth in the Capel's monument.
4486	
4487	BALTHASAR	It doth so, holy sir; and there's my master,
4488	One that you love.
4489	
4490	FRIAR LAURENCE	                  Who is it?
4491	
4492	BALTHASAR	Romeo.
4493	
4494	FRIAR LAURENCE	How long hath he been there?
4495	
4496	BALTHASAR	Full half an hour.
4497	
4498	FRIAR LAURENCE	Go with me to the vault.
4499	
4500	BALTHASAR	I dare not, sir
4501	My master knows not but I am gone hence;
4502	And fearfully did menace me with death,
4503	If I did stay to look on his intents.
4504	
4505	FRIAR LAURENCE	Stay, then; I'll go alone. Fear comes upon me:
4506	O, much I fear some ill unlucky thing.
4507	
4508	BALTHASAR	As I did sleep under this yew-tree here,
4509	I dreamt my master and another fought,
4510	And that my master slew him.
4511	
4512	FRIAR LAURENCE	Romeo!
4513	
4514	[Advances]
4515	
4516	Alack, alack, what blood is this, which stains
4517	The stony entrance of this sepulchre?
4518	What mean these masterless and gory swords
4519	To lie discolour'd by this place of peace?
4520	
4521	[Enters the tomb]
4522	
4523	Romeo! O, pale! Who else? what, Paris too?
4524	And steep'd in blood? Ah, what an unkind hour
4525	Is guilty of this lamentable chance!
4526	The lady stirs.
4527	
4528	[JULIET wakes]
4529	
4530	JULIET	O comfortable friar! where is my lord?
4531	I do remember well where I should be,
4532	And there I am. Where is my Romeo?
4533	
4534	[Noise within]
4535	
4536	FRIAR LAURENCE	I hear some noise. Lady, come from that nest
4537	Of death, contagion, and unnatural sleep:
4538	A greater power than we can contradict
4539	Hath thwarted our intents. Come, come away.
4540	Thy husband in thy bosom there lies dead;
4541	And Paris too. Come, I'll dispose of thee
4542	Among a sisterhood of holy nuns:
4543	Stay not to question, for the watch is coming;
4544	Come, go, good Juliet,
4545	
4546	[Noise again]
4547	
4548	I dare no longer stay.
4549	
4550	JULIET	Go, get thee hence, for I will not away.
4551	
4552	[Exit FRIAR LAURENCE]
4553	
4554	What's here? a cup, closed in my true love's hand?
4555	Poison, I see, hath been his timeless end:
4556	O churl! drunk all, and left no friendly drop
4557	To help me after? I will kiss thy lips;
4558	Haply some poison yet doth hang on them,
4559	To make die with a restorative.
4560	
4561	[Kisses him]
4562	
4563	Thy lips are warm.
4564	
4565	First Watchman	[Within]  Lead, boy: which way?
4566	
4567	JULIET	Yea, noise? then I'll be brief. O happy dagger!
4568	
4569	[Snatching ROMEO's dagger]
4570	
4571	This is thy sheath;
4572	
4573	[Stabs herself]
4574	
4575	there rust, and let me die.
4576	
4577	[Falls on ROMEO's body, and dies]
4578	
4579	[Enter Watch, with the Page of PARIS]
4580	
4581	PAGE	This is the place; there, where the torch doth burn.
4582	
4583	First Watchman	The ground is bloody; search about the churchyard:
4584	Go, some of you, whoe'er you find attach.
4585	Pitiful sight! here lies the county slain,
4586	And Juliet bleeding, warm, and newly dead,
4587	Who here hath lain these two days buried.
4588	Go, tell the prince: run to the Capulets:
4589	Raise up the Montagues: some others search:
4590	We see the ground whereon these woes do lie;
4591	But the true ground of all these piteous woes
4592	We cannot without circumstance descry.
4593	
4594	[Re-enter some of the Watch, with BALTHASAR]
4595	
4596	Second Watchman	Here's Romeo's man; we found him in the churchyard.
4597	
4598	First Watchman	Hold him in safety, till the prince come hither.
4599	
4600	[Re-enter others of the Watch, with FRIAR LAURENCE]
4601	
4602	Third Watchman	Here is a friar, that trembles, sighs and weeps:
4603	We took this mattock and this spade from him,
4604	As he was coming from this churchyard side.
4605	
4606	First Watchman	A great suspicion: stay the friar too.
4607	
4608	[Enter the PRINCE and Attendants]
4609	
4610	PRINCE	What misadventure is so early up,
4611	That calls our person from our morning's rest?
4612	
4613	[Enter CAPULET, LADY CAPULET, and others]
4614	
4615	CAPULET	What should it be, that they so shriek abroad?
4616	
4617	LADY CAPULET	The people in the street cry Romeo,
4618	Some Juliet, and some Paris; and all run,
4619	With open outcry toward our monument.
4620	
4621	PRINCE	What fear is this which startles in our ears?
4622	
4623	First Watchman	Sovereign, here lies the County Paris slain;
4624	And Romeo dead; and Juliet, dead before,
4625	Warm and new kill'd.
4626	
4627	PRINCE	Search, seek, and know how this foul murder comes.
4628	
4629	First Watchman	Here is a friar, and slaughter'd Romeo's man;
4630	With instruments upon them, fit to open
4631	These dead men's tombs.
4632	
4633	CAPULET	O heavens! O wife, look how our daughter bleeds!
4634	This dagger hath mista'en--for, lo, his house
4635	Is empty on the back of Montague,--
4636	And it mis-sheathed in my daughter's bosom!
4637	
4638	LADY CAPULET	O me! this sight of death is as a bell,
4639	That warns my old age to a sepulchre.
4640	
4641	[Enter MONTAGUE and others]
4642	
4643	PRINCE	Come, Montague; for thou art early up,
4644	To see thy son and heir more early down.
4645	
4646	MONTAGUE	Alas, my liege, my wife is dead to-night;
4647	Grief of my son's exile hath stopp'd her breath:
4648	What further woe conspires against mine age?
4649	
4650	PRINCE	Look, and thou shalt see.
4651	
4652	MONTAGUE	O thou untaught! what manners is in this?
4653	To press before thy father to a grave?
4654	
4655	PRINCE	Seal up the mouth of outrage for a while,
4656	Till we can clear these ambiguities,
4657	And know their spring, their head, their
4658	true descent;
4659	And then will I be general of your woes,
4660	And lead you even to death: meantime forbear,
4661	And let mischance be slave to patience.
4662	Bring forth the parties of suspicion.
4663	
4664	FRIAR LAURENCE	I am the greatest, able to do least,
4665	Yet most suspected, as the time and place
4666	Doth make against me of this direful murder;
4667	And here I stand, both to impeach and purge
4668	Myself condemned and myself excused.
4669	
4670	PRINCE	Then say at once what thou dost know in this.
4671	
4672	FRIAR LAURENCE	I will be brief, for my short date of breath
4673	Is not so long as is a tedious tale.
4674	Romeo, there dead, was husband to that Juliet;
4675	And she, there dead, that Romeo's faithful wife:
4676	I married them; and their stol'n marriage-day
4677	Was Tybalt's dooms-day, whose untimely death
4678	Banish'd the new-made bridegroom from the city,
4679	For whom, and not for Tybalt, Juliet pined.
4680	You, to remove that siege of grief from her,
4681	Betroth'd and would have married her perforce
4682	To County Paris: then comes she to me,
4683	And, with wild looks, bid me devise some mean
4684	To rid her from this second marriage,
4685	Or in my cell there would she kill herself.
4686	Then gave I her, so tutor'd by my art,
4687	A sleeping potion; which so took effect
4688	As I intended, for it wrought on her
4689	The form of death: meantime I writ to Romeo,
4690	That he should hither come as this dire night,
4691	To help to take her from her borrow'd grave,
4692	Being the time the potion's force should cease.
4693	But he which bore my letter, Friar John,
4694	Was stay'd by accident, and yesternight
4695	Return'd my letter back. Then all alone
4696	At the prefixed hour of her waking,
4697	Came I to take her from her kindred's vault;
4698	Meaning to keep her closely at my cell,
4699	Till I conveniently could send to Romeo:
4700	But when I came, some minute ere the time
4701	Of her awaking, here untimely lay
4702	The noble Paris and true Romeo dead.
4703	She wakes; and I entreated her come forth,
4704	And bear this work of heaven with patience:
4705	But then a noise did scare me from the tomb;
4706	And she, too desperate, would not go with me,
4707	But, as it seems, did violence on herself.
4708	All this I know; and to the marriage
4709	Her nurse is privy: and, if aught in this
4710	Miscarried by my fault, let my old life
4711	Be sacrificed, some hour before his time,
4712	Unto the rigour of severest law.
4713	
4714	PRINCE	We still have known thee for a holy man.
4715	Where's Romeo's man? what can he say in this?
4716	
4717	BALTHASAR	I brought my master news of Juliet's death;
4718	And then in post he came from Mantua
4719	To this same place, to this same monument.
4720	This letter he early bid me give his father,
4721	And threatened me with death, going in the vault,
4722	I departed not and left him there.
4723	
4724	PRINCE	Give me the letter; I will look on it.
4725	Where is the county's page, that raised the watch?
4726	Sirrah, what made your master in this place?
4727	
4728	PAGE	He came with flowers to strew his lady's grave;
4729	And bid me stand aloof, and so I did:
4730	Anon comes one with light to ope the tomb;
4731	And by and by my master drew on him;
4732	And then I ran away to call the watch.
4733	
4734	PRINCE	This letter doth make good the friar's words,
4735	Their course of love, the tidings of her death:
4736	And here he writes that he did buy a poison
4737	Of a poor 'pothecary, and therewithal
4738	Came to this vault to die, and lie with Juliet.
4739	Where be these enemies? Capulet! Montague!
4740	See, what a scourge is laid upon your hate,
4741	That heaven finds means to kill your joys with love.
4742	And I for winking at your discords too
4743	Have lost a brace of kinsmen: all are punish'd.
4744	
4745	CAPULET	O brother Montague, give me thy hand:
4746	This is my daughter's jointure, for no more
4747	Can I demand.
4748	
4749	MONTAGUE	                  But I can give thee more:
4750	For I will raise her statue in pure gold;
4751	That while Verona by that name is known,
4752	There shall no figure at such rate be set
4753	As that of true and faithful Juliet.
4754	
4755	CAPULET	As rich shall Romeo's by his lady's lie;
4756	Poor sacrifices of our enmity!
4757	
4758	PRINCE	A glooming peace this morning with it brings;
4759	The sun, for sorrow, will not show his head:
4760	Go hence, to have more talk of these sad things;
4761	Some shall be pardon'd, and some punished:
4762	For never was a story of more woe
4763	Than this of Juliet and her Romeo.
4764	
4765	[Exeunt]

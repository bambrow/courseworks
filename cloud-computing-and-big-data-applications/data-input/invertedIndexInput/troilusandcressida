78	PROLOGUE
79	
80	
81	In Troy, there lies the scene. From isles of Greece
82	The princes orgulous, their high blood chafed,
83	Have to the port of Athens sent their ships,
84	Fraught with the ministers and instruments
85	Of cruel war: sixty and nine, that wore
86	Their crownets regal, from the Athenian bay
87	Put forth toward Phrygia; and their vow is made
88	To ransack Troy, within whose strong immures
89	The ravish'd Helen, Menelaus' queen,
90	With wanton Paris sleeps; and that's the quarrel.
91	To Tenedos they come;
92	And the deep-drawing barks do there disgorge
93	Their warlike fraughtage: now on Dardan plains
94	The fresh and yet unbruised Greeks do pitch
95	Their brave pavilions: Priam's six-gated city,
96	Dardan, and Tymbria, Helias, Chetas, Troien,
97	And Antenorides, with massy staples
98	And corresponsive and fulfilling bolts,
99	Sperr up the sons of Troy.
100	Now expectation, tickling skittish spirits,
101	On one and other side, Trojan and Greek,
102	Sets all on hazard: and hither am I come
103	A prologue arm'd, but not in confidence
104	Of author's pen or actor's voice, but suited
105	In like conditions as our argument,
106	To tell you, fair beholders, that our play
107	Leaps o'er the vaunt and firstlings of those broils,
108	Beginning in the middle, starting thence away
109	To what may be digested in a play.
110	Like or find fault; do as your pleasures are:
111	Now good or bad, 'tis but the chance of war.

117	
118	
119	ACT I
120	
121	
122	
123	SCENE I	Troy. Before Priam's palace.
124	
125	
126	[Enter TROILUS armed, and PANDARUS]
127	
128	TROILUS	Call here my varlet; I'll unarm again:
129	Why should I war without the walls of Troy,
130	That find such cruel battle here within?
131	Each Trojan that is master of his heart,
132	Let him to field; Troilus, alas! hath none.
133	
134	PANDARUS	Will this gear ne'er be mended?
135	
136	TROILUS	The Greeks are strong and skilful to their strength,
137	Fierce to their skill and to their fierceness valiant;
138	But I am weaker than a woman's tear,
139	Tamer than sleep, fonder than ignorance,
140	Less valiant than the virgin in the night
141	And skilless as unpractised infancy.
142	
143	PANDARUS	Well, I have told you enough of this: for my part,
144	I'll not meddle nor make no further. He that will
145	have a cake out of the wheat must needs tarry the grinding.
146	
147	TROILUS	Have I not tarried?
148	
149	PANDARUS	Ay, the grinding; but you must tarry
150	the bolting.
151	
152	TROILUS	Have I not tarried?
153	
154	PANDARUS	Ay, the bolting, but you must tarry the leavening.
155	
156	TROILUS	Still have I tarried.
157	
158	PANDARUS	Ay, to the leavening; but here's yet in the word
159	'hereafter' the kneading, the making of the cake, the
160	heating of the oven and the baking; nay, you must
161	stay the cooling too, or you may chance to burn your lips.
162	
163	TROILUS	Patience herself, what goddess e'er she be,
164	Doth lesser blench at sufferance than I do.
165	At Priam's royal table do I sit;
166	And when fair Cressid comes into my thoughts,--
167	So, traitor! 'When she comes!' When is she thence?
168	
169	PANDARUS	Well, she looked yesternight fairer than ever I saw
170	her look, or any woman else.
171	
172	TROILUS	I was about to tell thee:--when my heart,
173	As wedged with a sigh, would rive in twain,
174	Lest Hector or my father should perceive me,
175	I have, as when the sun doth light a storm,
176	Buried this sigh in wrinkle of a smile:
177	But sorrow, that is couch'd in seeming gladness,
178	Is like that mirth fate turns to sudden sadness.
179	
180	PANDARUS	An her hair were not somewhat darker than Helen's--
181	well, go to--there were no more comparison between
182	the women: but, for my part, she is my kinswoman; I
183	would not, as they term it, praise her: but I would
184	somebody had heard her talk yesterday, as I did. I
185	will not dispraise your sister Cassandra's wit, but--
186	
187	TROILUS	O Pandarus! I tell thee, Pandarus,--
188	When I do tell thee, there my hopes lie drown'd,
189	Reply not in how many fathoms deep
190	They lie indrench'd. I tell thee I am mad
191	In Cressid's love: thou answer'st 'she is fair;'
192	Pour'st in the open ulcer of my heart
193	Her eyes, her hair, her cheek, her gait, her voice,
194	Handlest in thy discourse, O, that her hand,
195	In whose comparison all whites are ink,
196	Writing their own reproach, to whose soft seizure
197	The cygnet's down is harsh and spirit of sense
198	Hard as the palm of ploughman: this thou tell'st me,
199	As true thou tell'st me, when I say I love her;
200	But, saying thus, instead of oil and balm,
201	Thou lay'st in every gash that love hath given me
202	The knife that made it.
203	
204	PANDARUS	I speak no more than truth.
205	
206	TROILUS	Thou dost not speak so much.
207	
208	PANDARUS	Faith, I'll not meddle in't. Let her be as she is:
209	if she be fair, 'tis the better for her; an she be
210	not, she has the mends in her own hands.
211	
212	TROILUS	Good Pandarus, how now, Pandarus!
213	
214	PANDARUS	I have had my labour for my travail; ill-thought on of
215	her and ill-thought on of you; gone between and
216	between, but small thanks for my labour.
217	
218	TROILUS	What, art thou angry, Pandarus? what, with me?
219	
220	PANDARUS	Because she's kin to me, therefore she's not so fair
221	as Helen: an she were not kin to me, she would be as
222	fair on Friday as Helen is on Sunday. But what care
223	I? I care not an she were a black-a-moor; 'tis all one to me.
224	
225	TROILUS	Say I she is not fair?
226	
227	PANDARUS	I do not care whether you do or no. She's a fool to
228	stay behind her father; let her to the Greeks; and so
229	I'll tell her the next time I see her: for my part,
230	I'll meddle nor make no more i' the matter.
231	
232	TROILUS	Pandarus,--
233	
234	PANDARUS	Not I.
235	
236	TROILUS	Sweet Pandarus,--
237	
238	PANDARUS	Pray you, speak no more to me: I will leave all as I
239	found it, and there an end.
240	
241	[Exit PANDARUS. An alarum]
242	
243	TROILUS	Peace, you ungracious clamours! peace, rude sounds!
244	Fools on both sides! Helen must needs be fair,
245	When with your blood you daily paint her thus.
246	I cannot fight upon this argument;
247	It is too starved a subject for my sword.
248	But Pandarus,--O gods, how do you plague me!
249	I cannot come to Cressid but by Pandar;
250	And he's as tetchy to be woo'd to woo.
251	As she is stubborn-chaste against all suit.
252	Tell me, Apollo, for thy Daphne's love,
253	What Cressid is, what Pandar, and what we?
254	Her bed is India; there she lies, a pearl:
255	Between our Ilium and where she resides,
256	Let it be call'd the wild and wandering flood,
257	Ourself the merchant, and this sailing Pandar
258	Our doubtful hope, our convoy and our bark.
259	
260	[Alarum. Enter AENEAS]
261	
262	AENEAS	How now, Prince Troilus! wherefore not afield?
263	
264	TROILUS	Because not there: this woman's answer sorts,
265	For womanish it is to be from thence.
266	What news, AEneas, from the field to-day?
267	
268	AENEAS	That Paris is returned home and hurt.
269	
270	TROILUS	By whom, AEneas?
271	
272	AENEAS	                  Troilus, by Menelaus.
273	
274	TROILUS	Let Paris bleed; 'tis but a scar to scorn;
275	Paris is gored with Menelaus' horn.
276	
277	[Alarum]
278	
279	AENEAS	Hark, what good sport is out of town to-day!
280	
281	TROILUS	Better at home, if 'would I might' were 'may.'
282	But to the sport abroad: are you bound thither?
283	
284	AENEAS	In all swift haste.
285	
286	TROILUS	Come, go we then together.
287	
288	[Exeunt]

293	TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
294	
295	
296	ACT I
297	
298	
299	
300	SCENE II	The Same. A street.
301	
302	
303	[Enter CRESSIDA and ALEXANDER]
304	
305	CRESSIDA	Who were those went by?
306	
307	ALEXANDER	Queen Hecuba and Helen.
308	
309	CRESSIDA	And whither go they?
310	
311	ALEXANDER	Up to the eastern tower,
312	Whose height commands as subject all the vale,
313	To see the battle. Hector, whose patience
314	Is, as a virtue, fix'd, to-day was moved:
315	He chid Andromache and struck his armourer,
316	And, like as there were husbandry in war,
317	Before the sun rose he was harness'd light,
318	And to the field goes he; where every flower
319	Did, as a prophet, weep what it foresaw
320	In Hector's wrath.
321	
322	CRESSIDA	                  What was his cause of anger?
323	
324	ALEXANDER	The noise goes, this: there is among the Greeks
325	A lord of Trojan blood, nephew to Hector;
326	They call him Ajax.
327	
328	CRESSIDA	Good; and what of him?
329	
330	ALEXANDER	They say he is a very man per se,
331	And stands alone.
332	
333	CRESSIDA	So do all men, unless they are drunk, sick, or have no legs.
334	
335	ALEXANDER	This man, lady, hath robbed many beasts of their
336	particular additions; he is as valiant as the lion,
337	churlish as the bear, slow as the elephant: a man
338	into whom nature hath so crowded humours that his
339	valour is crushed into folly, his folly sauced with
340	discretion: there is no man hath a virtue that he
341	hath not a glimpse of, nor any man an attaint but he
342	carries some stain of it: he is melancholy without
343	cause, and merry against the hair: he hath the
344	joints of every thing, but everything so out of joint
345	that he is a gouty Briareus, many hands and no use,
346	or purblind Argus, all eyes and no sight.
347	
348	CRESSIDA	But how should this man, that makes
349	me smile, make Hector angry?
350	
351	ALEXANDER	They say he yesterday coped Hector in the battle and
352	struck him down, the disdain and shame whereof hath
353	ever since kept Hector fasting and waking.
354	
355	CRESSIDA	Who comes here?
356	
357	ALEXANDER	Madam, your uncle Pandarus.
358	
359	[Enter PANDARUS]
360	
361	CRESSIDA	Hector's a gallant man.
362	
363	ALEXANDER	As may be in the world, lady.
364	
365	PANDARUS	What's that? what's that?
366	
367	CRESSIDA	Good morrow, uncle Pandarus.
368	
369	PANDARUS	Good morrow, cousin Cressid: what do you talk of?
370	Good morrow, Alexander. How do you, cousin? When
371	were you at Ilium?
372	
373	CRESSIDA	This morning, uncle.
374	
375	PANDARUS	What were you talking of when I came? Was Hector
376	armed and gone ere ye came to Ilium? Helen was not
377	up, was she?
378	
379	CRESSIDA	Hector was gone, but Helen was not up.
380	
381	PANDARUS	Even so: Hector was stirring early.
382	
383	CRESSIDA	That were we talking of, and of his anger.
384	
385	PANDARUS	Was he angry?
386	
387	CRESSIDA	So he says here.
388	
389	PANDARUS	True, he was so: I know the cause too: he'll lay
390	about him to-day, I can tell them that: and there's
391	Troilus will not come far behind him: let them take
392	heed of Troilus, I can tell them that too.
393	
394	CRESSIDA	What, is he angry too?
395	
396	PANDARUS	Who, Troilus? Troilus is the better man of the two.
397	
398	CRESSIDA	O Jupiter! there's no comparison.
399	
400	PANDARUS	What, not between Troilus and Hector? Do you know a
401	man if you see him?
402	
403	CRESSIDA	Ay, if I ever saw him before and knew him.
404	
405	PANDARUS	Well, I say Troilus is Troilus.
406	
407	CRESSIDA	Then you say as I say; for, I am sure, he is not Hector.
408	
409	PANDARUS	No, nor Hector is not Troilus in some degrees.
410	
411	CRESSIDA	'Tis just to each of them; he is himself.
412	
413	PANDARUS	Himself! Alas, poor Troilus! I would he were.
414	
415	CRESSIDA	So he is.
416	
417	PANDARUS	Condition, I had gone barefoot to India.
418	
419	CRESSIDA	He is not Hector.
420	
421	PANDARUS	Himself! no, he's not himself: would a' were
422	himself! Well, the gods are above; time must friend
423	or end: well, Troilus, well: I would my heart were
424	in her body. No, Hector is not a better man than Troilus.
425	
426	CRESSIDA	Excuse me.
427	
428	PANDARUS	He is elder.
429	
430	CRESSIDA	Pardon me, pardon me.
431	
432	PANDARUS	Th' other's not come to't; you shall tell me another
433	tale, when th' other's come to't. Hector shall not
434	have his wit this year.
435	
436	CRESSIDA	He shall not need it, if he have his own.
437	
438	PANDARUS	Nor his qualities.
439	
440	CRESSIDA	No matter.
441	
442	PANDARUS	Nor his beauty.
443	
444	CRESSIDA	'Twould not become him; his own's better.
445	
446	PANDARUS	You have no judgment, niece: Helen
447	herself swore th' other day, that Troilus, for
448	a brown favour--for so 'tis, I must confess,--
449	not brown neither,--
450	
451	CRESSIDA	No, but brown.
452	
453	PANDARUS	'Faith, to say truth, brown and not brown.
454	
455	CRESSIDA	To say the truth, true and not true.
456	
457	PANDARUS	She praised his complexion above Paris.
458	
459	CRESSIDA	Why, Paris hath colour enough.
460	
461	PANDARUS	So he has.
462	
463	CRESSIDA	Then Troilus should have too much: if she praised
464	him above, his complexion is higher than his; he
465	having colour enough, and the other higher, is too
466	flaming a praise for a good complexion. I had as
467	lief Helen's golden tongue had commended Troilus for
468	a copper nose.
469	
470	PANDARUS	I swear to you. I think Helen loves him better than Paris.
471	
472	CRESSIDA	Then she's a merry Greek indeed.
473	
474	PANDARUS	Nay, I am sure she does. She came to him th' other
475	day into the compassed window,--and, you know, he
476	has not past three or four hairs on his chin,--
477	
478	CRESSIDA	Indeed, a tapster's arithmetic may soon bring his
479	particulars therein to a total.
480	
481	PANDARUS	Why, he is very young: and yet will he, within
482	three pound, lift as much as his brother Hector.
483	
484	CRESSIDA	Is he so young a man and so old a lifter?
485	
486	PANDARUS	But to prove to you that Helen loves him: she came
487	and puts me her white hand to his cloven chin--
488	
489	CRESSIDA	Juno have mercy! how came it cloven?
490	
491	PANDARUS	Why, you know 'tis dimpled: I think his smiling
492	becomes him better than any man in all Phrygia.
493	
494	CRESSIDA	O, he smiles valiantly.
495	
496	PANDARUS	Does he not?
497	
498	CRESSIDA	O yes, an 'twere a cloud in autumn.
499	
500	PANDARUS	Why, go to, then: but to prove to you that Helen
501	loves Troilus,--
502	
503	CRESSIDA	Troilus will stand to the proof, if you'll
504	prove it so.
505	
506	PANDARUS	Troilus! why, he esteems her no more than I esteem
507	an addle egg.
508	
509	CRESSIDA	If you love an addle egg as well as you love an idle
510	head, you would eat chickens i' the shell.
511	
512	PANDARUS	I cannot choose but laugh, to think how she tickled
513	his chin: indeed, she has a marvellous white hand, I
514	must needs confess,--
515	
516	CRESSIDA	Without the rack.
517	
518	PANDARUS	And she takes upon her to spy a white hair on his chin.
519	
520	CRESSIDA	Alas, poor chin! many a wart is richer.
521	
522	PANDARUS	But there was such laughing! Queen Hecuba laughed
523	that her eyes ran o'er.
524	
525	CRESSIDA	With mill-stones.
526	
527	PANDARUS	And Cassandra laughed.
528	
529	CRESSIDA	But there was more temperate fire under the pot of
530	her eyes: did her eyes run o'er too?
531	
532	PANDARUS	And Hector laughed.
533	
534	CRESSIDA	At what was all this laughing?
535	
536	PANDARUS	Marry, at the white hair that Helen spied on Troilus' chin.
537	
538	CRESSIDA	An't had been a green hair, I should have laughed
539	too.
540	
541	PANDARUS	They laughed not so much at the hair as at his pretty answer.
542	
543	CRESSIDA	What was his answer?
544	
545	PANDARUS	Quoth she, 'Here's but two and fifty hairs on your
546	chin, and one of them is white.
547	
548	CRESSIDA	This is her question.
549	
550	PANDARUS	That's true; make no question of that. 'Two and
551	fifty hairs' quoth he, 'and one white: that white
552	hair is my father, and all the rest are his sons.'
553	'Jupiter!' quoth she, 'which of these hairs is Paris,
554	my husband? 'The forked one,' quoth he, 'pluck't
555	out, and give it him.' But there was such laughing!
556	and Helen so blushed, an Paris so chafed, and all the
557	rest so laughed, that it passed.
558	
559	CRESSIDA	So let it now; for it has been while going by.
560	
561	PANDARUS	Well, cousin. I told you a thing yesterday; think on't.
562	
563	CRESSIDA	So I do.
564	
565	PANDARUS	I'll be sworn 'tis true; he will weep you, an 'twere
566	a man born in April.
567	
568	CRESSIDA	And I'll spring up in his tears, an 'twere a nettle
569	against May.
570	
571	[A retreat sounded]
572	
573	PANDARUS	Hark! they are coming from the field: shall we
574	stand up here, and see them as they pass toward
575	Ilium? good niece, do, sweet niece Cressida.
576	
577	CRESSIDA	At your pleasure.
578	
579	PANDARUS	Here, here, here's an excellent place; here we may
580	see most bravely: I'll tell you them all by their
581	names as they pass by; but mark Troilus above the rest.
582	
583	CRESSIDA	Speak not so loud.
584	
585	[AENEAS passes]
586	
587	PANDARUS	That's AEneas: is not that a brave man? he's one of
588	the flowers of Troy, I can tell you: but mark
589	Troilus; you shall see anon.
590	
591	[ANTENOR passes]
592	
593	CRESSIDA	Who's that?
594	
595	PANDARUS	That's Antenor: he has a shrewd wit, I can tell you;
596	and he's a man good enough, he's one o' the soundest
597	judgments in whosoever, and a proper man of person.
598	When comes Troilus? I'll show you Troilus anon: if
599	he see me, you shall see him nod at me.
600	
601	CRESSIDA	Will he give you the nod?
602	
603	PANDARUS	You shall see.
604	
605	CRESSIDA	If he do, the rich shall have more.
606	
607	[HECTOR passes]
608	
609	PANDARUS	That's Hector, that, that, look you, that; there's a
610	fellow! Go thy way, Hector! There's a brave man,
611	niece. O brave Hector! Look how he looks! there's
612	a countenance! is't not a brave man?
613	
614	CRESSIDA	O, a brave man!
615	
616	PANDARUS	Is a' not? it does a man's heart good. Look you
617	what hacks are on his helmet! look you yonder, do
618	you see? look you there: there's no jesting;
619	there's laying on, take't off who will, as they say:
620	there be hacks!
621	
622	CRESSIDA	Be those with swords?
623	
624	PANDARUS	Swords! any thing, he cares not; an the devil come
625	to him, it's all one: by God's lid, it does one's
626	heart good. Yonder comes Paris, yonder comes Paris.
627	
628	[PARIS passes]
629	
630	Look ye yonder, niece; is't not a gallant man too,
631	is't not? Why, this is brave now. Who said he came
632	hurt home to-day? he's not hurt: why, this will do
633	Helen's heart good now, ha! Would I could see
634	Troilus now! You shall see Troilus anon.
635	
636	[HELENUS passes]
637	
638	CRESSIDA	Who's that?
639	
640	PANDARUS	That's Helenus. I marvel where Troilus is. That's
641	Helenus. I think he went not forth to-day. That's Helenus.
642	
643	CRESSIDA	Can Helenus fight, uncle?
644	
645	PANDARUS	Helenus? no. Yes, he'll fight indifferent well. I
646	marvel where Troilus is. Hark! do you not hear the
647	people cry 'Troilus'? Helenus is a priest.
648	
649	CRESSIDA	What sneaking fellow comes yonder?
650	
651	[TROILUS passes]
652	
653	PANDARUS	Where? yonder? that's Deiphobus. 'Tis Troilus!
654	there's a man, niece! Hem! Brave Troilus! the
655	prince of chivalry!
656	
657	CRESSIDA	Peace, for shame, peace!
658	
659	PANDARUS	Mark him; note him. O brave Troilus! Look well upon
660	him, niece: look you how his sword is bloodied, and
661	his helm more hacked than Hector's, and how he looks,
662	and how he goes! O admirable youth! he ne'er saw
663	three and twenty. Go thy way, Troilus, go thy way!
664	Had I a sister were a grace, or a daughter a goddess,
665	he should take his choice. O admirable man! Paris?
666	Paris is dirt to him; and, I warrant, Helen, to
667	change, would give an eye to boot.
668	
669	CRESSIDA	Here come more.
670	
671	[Forces pass]
672	
673	PANDARUS	Asses, fools, dolts! chaff and bran, chaff and bran!
674	porridge after meat! I could live and die i' the
675	eyes of Troilus. Ne'er look, ne'er look: the eagles
676	are gone: crows and daws, crows and daws! I had
677	rather be such a man as Troilus than Agamemnon and
678	all Greece.
679	
680	CRESSIDA	There is among the Greeks Achilles, a better man than Troilus.
681	
682	PANDARUS	Achilles! a drayman, a porter, a very camel.
683	
684	CRESSIDA	Well, well.
685	
686	PANDARUS	'Well, well!' why, have you any discretion? have
687	you any eyes? Do you know what a man is? Is not
688	birth, beauty, good shape, discourse, manhood,
689	learning, gentleness, virtue, youth, liberality,
690	and such like, the spice and salt that season a man?
691	
692	CRESSIDA	Ay, a minced man: and then to be baked with no date
693	in the pie, for then the man's date's out.
694	
695	PANDARUS	You are such a woman! one knows not at what ward you
696	lie.
697	
698	CRESSIDA	Upon my back, to defend my belly; upon my wit, to
699	defend my wiles; upon my secrecy, to defend mine
700	honesty; my mask, to defend my beauty; and you, to
701	defend all these: and at all these wards I lie, at a
702	thousand watches.
703	
704	PANDARUS	Say one of your watches.
705	
706	CRESSIDA	Nay, I'll watch you for that; and that's one of the
707	chiefest of them too: if I cannot ward what I would
708	not have hit, I can watch you for telling how I took
709	the blow; unless it swell past hiding, and then it's
710	past watching.
711	
712	PANDARUS	You are such another!
713	
714	[Enter Troilus's Boy]
715	
716	Boy	Sir, my lord would instantly speak with you.
717	
718	PANDARUS	Where?
719	
720	Boy	At your own house; there he unarms him.
721	
722	PANDARUS	Good boy, tell him I come.
723	
724	[Exit boy]
725	
726	I doubt he be hurt. Fare ye well, good niece.
727	
728	CRESSIDA	Adieu, uncle.
729	
730	PANDARUS	I'll be with you, niece, by and by.
731	
732	CRESSIDA	To bring, uncle?
733	
734	PANDARUS	Ay, a token from Troilus.
735	
736	CRESSIDA	By the same token, you are a bawd.
737	
738	[Exit PANDARUS]
739	
740	Words, vows, gifts, tears, and love's full sacrifice,
741	He offers in another's enterprise;
742	But more in Troilus thousand fold I see
743	Than in the glass of Pandar's praise may be;
744	Yet hold I off. Women are angels, wooing:
745	Things won are done; joy's soul lies in the doing.
746	That she beloved knows nought that knows not this:
747	Men prize the thing ungain'd more than it is:
748	That she was never yet that ever knew
749	Love got so sweet as when desire did sue.
750	Therefore this maxim out of love I teach:
751	Achievement is command; ungain'd, beseech:
752	Then though my heart's content firm love doth bear,
753	Nothing of that shall from mine eyes appear.
754	
755	[Exeunt]
756	
757

759	
760	TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
761	
762	
763	ACT I
764	
765	
766	
767	SCENE III	The Grecian camp. Before Agamemnon's tent.
768	
769	
770	[Sennet. Enter AGAMEMNON, NESTOR, ULYSSES,
771	MENELAUS, and others]
772	
773	AGAMEMNON	Princes,
774	What grief hath set the jaundice on your cheeks?
775	The ample proposition that hope makes
776	In all designs begun on earth below
777	Fails in the promised largeness: cheques and disasters
778	Grow in the veins of actions highest rear'd,
779	As knots, by the conflux of meeting sap,
780	Infect the sound pine and divert his grain
781	Tortive and errant from his course of growth.
782	Nor, princes, is it matter new to us
783	That we come short of our suppose so far
784	That after seven years' siege yet Troy walls stand;
785	Sith every action that hath gone before,
786	Whereof we have record, trial did draw
787	Bias and thwart, not answering the aim,
788	And that unbodied figure of the thought
789	That gave't surmised shape. Why then, you princes,
790	Do you with cheeks abash'd behold our works,
791	And call them shames? which are indeed nought else
792	But the protractive trials of great Jove
793	To find persistive constancy in men:
794	The fineness of which metal is not found
795	In fortune's love; for then the bold and coward,
796	The wise and fool, the artist and unread,
797	The hard and soft seem all affined and kin:
798	But, in the wind and tempest of her frown,
799	Distinction, with a broad and powerful fan,
800	Puffing at all, winnows the light away;
801	And what hath mass or matter, by itself
802	Lies rich in virtue and unmingled.
803	
804	NESTOR	With due observance of thy godlike seat,
805	Great Agamemnon, Nestor shall apply
806	Thy latest words. In the reproof of chance
807	Lies the true proof of men: the sea being smooth,
808	How many shallow bauble boats dare sail
809	Upon her patient breast, making their way
810	With those of nobler bulk!
811	But let the ruffian Boreas once enrage
812	The gentle Thetis, and anon behold
813	The strong-ribb'd bark through liquid mountains cut,
814	Bounding between the two moist elements,
815	Like Perseus' horse: where's then the saucy boat
816	Whose weak untimber'd sides but even now
817	Co-rivall'd greatness? Either to harbour fled,
818	Or made a toast for Neptune. Even so
819	Doth valour's show and valour's worth divide
820	In storms of fortune; for in her ray and brightness
821	The herd hath more annoyance by the breeze
822	Than by the tiger; but when the splitting wind
823	Makes flexible the knees of knotted oaks,
824	And flies fled under shade, why, then the thing of courage
825	As roused with rage with rage doth sympathize,
826	And with an accent tuned in selfsame key
827	Retorts to chiding fortune.
828	
829	ULYSSES	Agamemnon,
830	Thou great commander, nerve and bone of Greece,
831	Heart of our numbers, soul and only spirit.
832	In whom the tempers and the minds of all
833	Should be shut up, hear what Ulysses speaks.
834	Besides the applause and approbation To which,
835	
836	[To AGAMEMNON]
837	
838	most mighty for thy place and sway,
839	
840	[To NESTOR]
841	
842	And thou most reverend for thy stretch'd-out life
843	I give to both your speeches, which were such
844	As Agamemnon and the hand of Greece
845	Should hold up high in brass, and such again
846	As venerable Nestor, hatch'd in silver,
847	Should with a bond of air, strong as the axle-tree
848	On which heaven rides, knit all the Greekish ears
849	To his experienced tongue, yet let it please both,
850	Thou great, and wise, to hear Ulysses speak.
851	
852	AGAMEMNON	Speak, prince of Ithaca; and be't of less expect
853	That matter needless, of importless burden,
854	Divide thy lips, than we are confident,
855	When rank Thersites opes his mastic jaws,
856	We shall hear music, wit and oracle.
857	
858	ULYSSES	Troy, yet upon his basis, had been down,
859	And the great Hector's sword had lack'd a master,
860	But for these instances.
861	The specialty of rule hath been neglected:
862	And, look, how many Grecian tents do stand
863	Hollow upon this plain, so many hollow factions.
864	When that the general is not like the hive
865	To whom the foragers shall all repair,
866	What honey is expected? Degree being vizarded,
867	The unworthiest shows as fairly in the mask.
868	The heavens themselves, the planets and this centre
869	Observe degree, priority and place,
870	Insisture, course, proportion, season, form,
871	Office and custom, in all line of order;
872	And therefore is the glorious planet Sol
873	In noble eminence enthroned and sphered
874	Amidst the other; whose medicinable eye
875	Corrects the ill aspects of planets evil,
876	And posts, like the commandment of a king,
877	Sans cheque to good and bad: but when the planets
878	In evil mixture to disorder wander,
879	What plagues and what portents! what mutiny!
880	What raging of the sea! shaking of earth!
881	Commotion in the winds! frights, changes, horrors,
882	Divert and crack, rend and deracinate
883	The unity and married calm of states
884	Quite from their fixure! O, when degree is shaked,
885	Which is the ladder to all high designs,
886	Then enterprise is sick! How could communities,
887	Degrees in schools and brotherhoods in cities,
888	Peaceful commerce from dividable shores,
889	The primogenitive and due of birth,
890	Prerogative of age, crowns, sceptres, laurels,
891	But by degree, stand in authentic place?
892	Take but degree away, untune that string,
893	And, hark, what discord follows! each thing meets
894	In mere oppugnancy: the bounded waters
895	Should lift their bosoms higher than the shores
896	And make a sop of all this solid globe:
897	Strength should be lord of imbecility,
898	And the rude son should strike his father dead:
899	Force should be right; or rather, right and wrong,
900	Between whose endless jar justice resides,
901	Should lose their names, and so should justice too.
902	Then every thing includes itself in power,
903	Power into will, will into appetite;
904	And appetite, an universal wolf,
905	So doubly seconded with will and power,
906	Must make perforce an universal prey,
907	And last eat up himself. Great Agamemnon,
908	This chaos, when degree is suffocate,
909	Follows the choking.
910	And this neglection of degree it is
911	That by a pace goes backward, with a purpose
912	It hath to climb. The general's disdain'd
913	By him one step below, he by the next,
914	That next by him beneath; so every step,
915	Exampled by the first pace that is sick
916	Of his superior, grows to an envious fever
917	Of pale and bloodless emulation:
918	And 'tis this fever that keeps Troy on foot,
919	Not her own sinews. To end a tale of length,
920	Troy in our weakness stands, not in her strength.
921	
922	NESTOR	Most wisely hath Ulysses here discover'd
923	The fever whereof all our power is sick.
924	
925	AGAMEMNON	The nature of the sickness found, Ulysses,
926	What is the remedy?
927	
928	ULYSSES	The great Achilles, whom opinion crowns
929	The sinew and the forehand of our host,
930	Having his ear full of his airy fame,
931	Grows dainty of his worth, and in his tent
932	Lies mocking our designs: with him Patroclus
933	Upon a lazy bed the livelong day
934	Breaks scurril jests;
935	And with ridiculous and awkward action,
936	Which, slanderer, he imitation calls,
937	He pageants us. Sometime, great Agamemnon,
938	Thy topless deputation he puts on,
939	And, like a strutting player, whose conceit
940	Lies in his hamstring, and doth think it rich
941	To hear the wooden dialogue and sound
942	'Twixt his stretch'd footing and the scaffoldage,--
943	Such to-be-pitied and o'er-wrested seeming
944	He acts thy greatness in: and when he speaks,
945	'Tis like a chime a-mending; with terms unsquared,
946	Which, from the tongue of roaring Typhon dropp'd
947	Would seem hyperboles. At this fusty stuff
948	The large Achilles, on his press'd bed lolling,
949	From his deep chest laughs out a loud applause;
950	Cries 'Excellent! 'tis Agamemnon just.
951	Now play me Nestor; hem, and stroke thy beard,
952	As he being drest to some oration.'
953	That's done, as near as the extremest ends
954	Of parallels, as like as Vulcan and his wife:
955	Yet god Achilles still cries 'Excellent!
956	'Tis Nestor right. Now play him me, Patroclus,
957	Arming to answer in a night alarm.'
958	And then, forsooth, the faint defects of age
959	Must be the scene of mirth; to cough and spit,
960	And, with a palsy-fumbling on his gorget,
961	Shake in and out the rivet: and at this sport
962	Sir Valour dies; cries 'O, enough, Patroclus;
963	Or give me ribs of steel! I shall split all
964	In pleasure of my spleen.' And in this fashion,
965	All our abilities, gifts, natures, shapes,
966	Severals and generals of grace exact,
967	Achievements, plots, orders, preventions,
968	Excitements to the field, or speech for truce,
969	Success or loss, what is or is not, serves
970	As stuff for these two to make paradoxes.
971	
972	NESTOR	And in the imitation of these twain--
973	Who, as Ulysses says, opinion crowns
974	With an imperial voice--many are infect.
975	Ajax is grown self-will'd, and bears his head
976	In such a rein, in full as proud a place
977	As broad Achilles; keeps his tent like him;
978	Makes factious feasts; rails on our state of war,
979	Bold as an oracle, and sets Thersites,
980	A slave whose gall coins slanders like a mint,
981	To match us in comparisons with dirt,
982	To weaken and discredit our exposure,
983	How rank soever rounded in with danger.
984	
985	ULYSSES	They tax our policy, and call it cowardice,
986	Count wisdom as no member of the war,
987	Forestall prescience, and esteem no act
988	But that of hand: the still and mental parts,
989	That do contrive how many hands shall strike,
990	When fitness calls them on, and know by measure
991	Of their observant toil the enemies' weight,--
992	Why, this hath not a finger's dignity:
993	They call this bed-work, mappery, closet-war;
994	So that the ram that batters down the wall,
995	For the great swing and rudeness of his poise,
996	They place before his hand that made the engine,
997	Or those that with the fineness of their souls
998	By reason guide his execution.
999	
1000	NESTOR	Let this be granted, and Achilles' horse
1001	Makes many Thetis' sons.
1002	
1003	[A tucket]
1004	
1005	AGAMEMNON	What trumpet? look, Menelaus.
1006	
1007	MENELAUS	From Troy.
1008	
1009	[Enter AENEAS]
1010	
1011	AGAMEMNON	What would you 'fore our tent?
1012	
1013	AENEAS	Is this great Agamemnon's tent, I pray you?
1014	
1015	AGAMEMNON	Even this.
1016	
1017	AENEAS	May one, that is a herald and a prince,
1018	Do a fair message to his kingly ears?
1019	
1020	AGAMEMNON	With surety stronger than Achilles' arm
1021	'Fore all the Greekish heads, which with one voice
1022	Call Agamemnon head and general.
1023	
1024	AENEAS	Fair leave and large security. How may
1025	A stranger to those most imperial looks
1026	Know them from eyes of other mortals?
1027	
1028	AGAMEMNON	How!
1029	
1030	AENEAS	Ay;
1031	I ask, that I might waken reverence,
1032	And bid the cheek be ready with a blush
1033	Modest as morning when she coldly eyes
1034	The youthful Phoebus:
1035	Which is that god in office, guiding men?
1036	Which is the high and mighty Agamemnon?
1037	
1038	AGAMEMNON	This Trojan scorns us; or the men of Troy
1039	Are ceremonious courtiers.
1040	
1041	AENEAS	Courtiers as free, as debonair, unarm'd,
1042	As bending angels; that's their fame in peace:
1043	But when they would seem soldiers, they have galls,
1044	Good arms, strong joints, true swords; and,
1045	Jove's accord,
1046	Nothing so full of heart. But peace, AEneas,
1047	Peace, Trojan; lay thy finger on thy lips!
1048	The worthiness of praise distains his worth,
1049	If that the praised himself bring the praise forth:
1050	But what the repining enemy commends,
1051	That breath fame blows; that praise, sole sure,
1052	transcends.
1053	
1054	AGAMEMNON	Sir, you of Troy, call you yourself AEneas?
1055	
1056	AENEAS	Ay, Greek, that is my name.
1057	
1058	AGAMEMNON	What's your affair I pray you?
1059	
1060	AENEAS	Sir, pardon; 'tis for Agamemnon's ears.
1061	
1062	AGAMEMNON	He hears naught privately that comes from Troy.
1063	
1064	AENEAS	Nor I from Troy come not to whisper him:
1065	I bring a trumpet to awake his ear,
1066	To set his sense on the attentive bent,
1067	And then to speak.
1068	
1069	AGAMEMNON	                  Speak frankly as the wind;
1070	It is not Agamemnon's sleeping hour:
1071	That thou shalt know. Trojan, he is awake,
1072	He tells thee so himself.
1073	
1074	AENEAS	Trumpet, blow loud,
1075	Send thy brass voice through all these lazy tents;
1076	And every Greek of mettle, let him know,
1077	What Troy means fairly shall be spoke aloud.
1078	
1079	[Trumpet sounds]
1080	
1081	We have, great Agamemnon, here in Troy
1082	A prince call'd Hector,--Priam is his father,--
1083	Who in this dull and long-continued truce
1084	Is rusty grown: he bade me take a trumpet,
1085	And to this purpose speak. Kings, princes, lords!
1086	If there be one among the fair'st of Greece
1087	That holds his honour higher than his ease,
1088	That seeks his praise more than he fears his peril,
1089	That knows his valour, and knows not his fear,
1090	That loves his mistress more than in confession,
1091	With truant vows to her own lips he loves,
1092	And dare avow her beauty and her worth
1093	In other arms than hers,--to him this challenge.
1094	Hector, in view of Trojans and of Greeks,
1095	Shall make it good, or do his best to do it,
1096	He hath a lady, wiser, fairer, truer,
1097	Than ever Greek did compass in his arms,
1098	And will to-morrow with his trumpet call
1099	Midway between your tents and walls of Troy,
1100	To rouse a Grecian that is true in love:
1101	If any come, Hector shall honour him;
1102	If none, he'll say in Troy when he retires,
1103	The Grecian dames are sunburnt and not worth
1104	The splinter of a lance. Even so much.
1105	
1106	AGAMEMNON	This shall be told our lovers, Lord AEneas;
1107	If none of them have soul in such a kind,
1108	We left them all at home: but we are soldiers;
1109	And may that soldier a mere recreant prove,
1110	That means not, hath not, or is not in love!
1111	If then one is, or hath, or means to be,
1112	That one meets Hector; if none else, I am he.
1113	
1114	NESTOR	Tell him of Nestor, one that was a man
1115	When Hector's grandsire suck'd: he is old now;
1116	But if there be not in our Grecian host
1117	One noble man that hath one spark of fire,
1118	To answer for his love, tell him from me
1119	I'll hide my silver beard in a gold beaver
1120	And in my vantbrace put this wither'd brawn,
1121	And meeting him will tell him that my lady
1122	Was fairer than his grandam and as chaste
1123	As may be in the world: his youth in flood,
1124	I'll prove this truth with my three drops of blood.
1125	
1126	AENEAS	Now heavens forbid such scarcity of youth!
1127	
1128	ULYSSES	Amen.
1129	
1130	AGAMEMNON	Fair Lord AEneas, let me touch your hand;
1131	To our pavilion shall I lead you, sir.
1132	Achilles shall have word of this intent;
1133	So shall each lord of Greece, from tent to tent:
1134	Yourself shall feast with us before you go
1135	And find the welcome of a noble foe.
1136	
1137	[Exeunt all but ULYSSES and NESTOR]
1138	
1139	ULYSSES	Nestor!
1140	
1141	NESTOR	What says Ulysses?
1142	
1143	ULYSSES	I have a young conception in my brain;
1144	Be you my time to bring it to some shape.
1145	
1146	NESTOR	What is't?
1147	
1148	ULYSSES	This 'tis:
1149	Blunt wedges rive hard knots: the seeded pride
1150	That hath to this maturity blown up
1151	In rank Achilles must or now be cropp'd,
1152	Or, shedding, breed a nursery of like evil,
1153	To overbulk us all.
1154	
1155	NESTOR	Well, and how?
1156	
1157	ULYSSES	This challenge that the gallant Hector sends,
1158	However it is spread in general name,
1159	Relates in purpose only to Achilles.
1160	
1161	NESTOR	The purpose is perspicuous even as substance,
1162	Whose grossness little characters sum up:
1163	And, in the publication, make no strain,
1164	But that Achilles, were his brain as barren
1165	As banks of Libya,--though, Apollo knows,
1166	'Tis dry enough,--will, with great speed of judgment,
1167	Ay, with celerity, find Hector's purpose
1168	Pointing on him.
1169	
1170	ULYSSES	And wake him to the answer, think you?
1171	
1172	NESTOR	Yes, 'tis most meet: whom may you else oppose,
1173	That can from Hector bring his honour off,
1174	If not Achilles? Though't be a sportful combat,
1175	Yet in the trial much opinion dwells;
1176	For here the Trojans taste our dear'st repute
1177	With their finest palate: and trust to me, Ulysses,
1178	Our imputation shall be oddly poised
1179	In this wild action; for the success,
1180	Although particular, shall give a scantling
1181	Of good or bad unto the general;
1182	And in such indexes, although small pricks
1183	To their subsequent volumes, there is seen
1184	The baby figure of the giant mass
1185	Of things to come at large. It is supposed
1186	He that meets Hector issues from our choice
1187	And choice, being mutual act of all our souls,
1188	Makes merit her election, and doth boil,
1189	As 'twere from us all, a man distill'd
1190	Out of our virtues; who miscarrying,
1191	What heart receives from hence the conquering part,
1192	To steel a strong opinion to themselves?
1193	Which entertain'd, limbs are his instruments,
1194	In no less working than are swords and bows
1195	Directive by the limbs.
1196	
1197	ULYSSES	Give pardon to my speech:
1198	Therefore 'tis meet Achilles meet not Hector.
1199	Let us, like merchants, show our foulest wares,
1200	And think, perchance, they'll sell; if not,
1201	The lustre of the better yet to show,
1202	Shall show the better. Do not consent
1203	That ever Hector and Achilles meet;
1204	For both our honour and our shame in this
1205	Are dogg'd with two strange followers.
1206	
1207	NESTOR	I see them not with my old eyes: what are they?
1208	
1209	ULYSSES	What glory our Achilles shares from Hector,
1210	Were he not proud, we all should share with him:
1211	But he already is too insolent;
1212	And we were better parch in Afric sun
1213	Than in the pride and salt scorn of his eyes,
1214	Should he 'scape Hector fair: if he were foil'd,
1215	Why then, we did our main opinion crush
1216	In taint of our best man. No, make a lottery;
1217	And, by device, let blockish Ajax draw
1218	The sort to fight with Hector: among ourselves
1219	Give him allowance for the better man;
1220	For that will physic the great Myrmidon
1221	Who broils in loud applause, and make him fall
1222	His crest that prouder than blue Iris bends.
1223	If the dull brainless Ajax come safe off,
1224	We'll dress him up in voices: if he fail,
1225	Yet go we under our opinion still
1226	That we have better men. But, hit or miss,
1227	Our project's life this shape of sense assumes:
1228	Ajax employ'd plucks down Achilles' plumes.
1229	
1230	NESTOR	Ulysses,
1231	Now I begin to relish thy advice;
1232	And I will give a taste of it forthwith
1233	To Agamemnon: go we to him straight.
1234	Two curs shall tame each other: pride alone
1235	Must tarre the mastiffs on, as 'twere their bone.

1248	
1249	SCENE I	A part of the Grecian camp.
1250	
1251	
1252	[Enter AJAX and THERSITES]
1253	
1254	AJAX	Thersites!
1255	
1256	THERSITES	Agamemnon, how if he had boils? full, all over,
1257	generally?
1258	
1259	AJAX	Thersites!
1260	
1261	THERSITES	And those boils did run? say so: did not the
1262	general run then? were not that a botchy core?
1263	
1264	AJAX	Dog!
1265	
1266	THERSITES	Then would come some matter from him; I see none now.
1267	
1268	AJAX	Thou bitch-wolf's son, canst thou not hear?
1269	
1270	[Beating him]
1271	
1272	Feel, then.
1273	
1274	THERSITES	The plague of Greece upon thee, thou mongrel
1275	beef-witted lord!
1276	
1277	AJAX	Speak then, thou vinewedst leaven, speak: I will
1278	beat thee into handsomeness.
1279	
1280	THERSITES	I shall sooner rail thee into wit and holiness: but,
1281	I think, thy horse will sooner con an oration than
1282	thou learn a prayer without book. Thou canst strike,
1283	canst thou? a red murrain o' thy jade's tricks!
1284	
1285	AJAX	Toadstool, learn me the proclamation.
1286	
1287	THERSITES	Dost thou think I have no sense, thou strikest me thus?
1288	
1289	AJAX	The proclamation!
1290	
1291	THERSITES	Thou art proclaimed a fool, I think.
1292	
1293	AJAX	Do not, porpentine, do not: my fingers itch.
1294	
1295	THERSITES	I would thou didst itch from head to foot and I had
1296	the scratching of thee; I would make thee the
1297	loathsomest scab in Greece. When thou art forth in
1298	the incursions, thou strikest as slow as another.
1299	
1300	AJAX	I say, the proclamation!
1301	
1302	THERSITES	Thou grumblest and railest every hour on Achilles,
1303	and thou art as full of envy at his greatness as
1304	Cerberus is at Proserpine's beauty, ay, that thou
1305	barkest at him.
1306	
1307	AJAX	Mistress Thersites!
1308	
1309	THERSITES	Thou shouldest strike him.
1310	
1311	AJAX	Cobloaf!
1312	
1313	THERSITES	He would pun thee into shivers with his fist, as a
1314	sailor breaks a biscuit.
1315	
1316	AJAX	[Beating him]  You whoreson cur!
1317	
1318	THERSITES	Do, do.
1319	
1320	AJAX	Thou stool for a witch!
1321	
1322	THERSITES	Ay, do, do; thou sodden-witted lord! thou hast no
1323	more brain than I have in mine elbows; an assinego
1324	may tutor thee: thou scurvy-valiant ass! thou art
1325	here but to thrash Trojans; and thou art bought and
1326	sold among those of any wit, like a barbarian slave.
1327	If thou use to beat me, I will begin at thy heel, and
1328	tell what thou art by inches, thou thing of no
1329	bowels, thou!
1330	
1331	AJAX	You dog!
1332	
1333	THERSITES	You scurvy lord!
1334	
1335	AJAX	[Beating him]  You cur!
1336	
1337	THERSITES	Mars his idiot! do, rudeness; do, camel; do, do.
1338	
1339	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]
1340	
1341	ACHILLES	Why, how now, Ajax! wherefore do you thus? How now,
1342	Thersites! what's the matter, man?
1343	
1344	THERSITES	You see him there, do you?
1345	
1346	ACHILLES	Ay; what's the matter?
1347	
1348	THERSITES	Nay, look upon him.
1349	
1350	ACHILLES	So I do: what's the matter?
1351	
1352	THERSITES	Nay, but regard him well.
1353	
1354	ACHILLES	'Well!' why, I do so.
1355	
1356	THERSITES	But yet you look not well upon him; for whosoever you
1357	take him to be, he is Ajax.
1358	
1359	ACHILLES	I know that, fool.
1360	
1361	THERSITES	Ay, but that fool knows not himself.
1362	
1363	AJAX	Therefore I beat thee.
1364	
1365	THERSITES	Lo, lo, lo, lo, what modicums of wit he utters! his
1366	evasions have ears thus long. I have bobbed his
1367	brain more than he has beat my bones: I will buy
1368	nine sparrows for a penny, and his pia mater is not
1369	worth the nineth part of a sparrow. This lord,
1370	Achilles, Ajax, who wears his wit in his belly and
1371	his guts in his head, I'll tell you what I say of
1372	him.
1373	
1374	ACHILLES	What?
1375	
1376	THERSITES	I say, this Ajax--
1377	
1378	[Ajax offers to beat him]
1379	
1380	ACHILLES	Nay, good Ajax.
1381	
1382	THERSITES	Has not so much wit--
1383	
1384	ACHILLES	Nay, I must hold you.
1385	
1386	THERSITES	As will stop the eye of Helen's needle, for whom he
1387	comes to fight.
1388	
1389	ACHILLES	Peace, fool!
1390	
1391	THERSITES	I would have peace and quietness, but the fool will
1392	not: he there: that he: look you there.
1393	
1394	AJAX	O thou damned cur! I shall--
1395	
1396	ACHILLES	Will you set your wit to a fool's?
1397	
1398	THERSITES	No, I warrant you; for a fools will shame it.
1399	
1400	PATROCLUS	Good words, Thersites.
1401	
1402	ACHILLES	What's the quarrel?
1403	
1404	AJAX	I bade the vile owl go learn me the tenor of the
1405	proclamation, and he rails upon me.
1406	
1407	THERSITES	I serve thee not.
1408	
1409	AJAX	Well, go to, go to.
1410	
1411	THERSITES	I serve here voluntarily.
1412	
1413	ACHILLES	Your last service was sufferance, 'twas not
1414	voluntary: no man is beaten voluntary: Ajax was
1415	here the voluntary, and you as under an impress.
1416	
1417	THERSITES	E'en so; a great deal of your wit, too, lies in your
1418	sinews, or else there be liars. Hector have a great
1419	catch, if he knock out either of your brains: a'
1420	were as good crack a fusty nut with no kernel.
1421	
1422	ACHILLES	What, with me too, Thersites?
1423	
1424	THERSITES	There's Ulysses and old Nestor, whose wit was mouldy
1425	ere your grandsires had nails on their toes, yoke you
1426	like draught-oxen and make you plough up the wars.
1427	
1428	ACHILLES	What, what?
1429	
1430	THERSITES	Yes, good sooth: to, Achilles! to, Ajax! to!
1431	
1432	AJAX	I shall cut out your tongue.
1433	
1434	THERSITES	'Tis no matter! I shall speak as much as thou
1435	afterwards.
1436	
1437	PATROCLUS	No more words, Thersites; peace!
1438	
1439	THERSITES	I will hold my peace when Achilles' brach bids me, shall I?
1440	
1441	ACHILLES	There's for you, Patroclus.
1442	
1443	THERSITES	I will see you hanged, like clotpoles, ere I come
1444	any more to your tents: I will keep where there is
1445	wit stirring and leave the faction of fools.
1446	
1447	[Exit]
1448	
1449	PATROCLUS	A good riddance.
1450	
1451	ACHILLES	Marry, this, sir, is proclaim'd through all our host:
1452	That Hector, by the fifth hour of the sun,
1453	Will with a trumpet 'twixt our tents and Troy
1454	To-morrow morning call some knight to arms
1455	That hath a stomach; and such a one that dare
1456	Maintain--I know not what: 'tis trash. Farewell.
1457	
1458	AJAX	Farewell. Who shall answer him?
1459	
1460	ACHILLES	I know not: 'tis put to lottery; otherwise
1461	He knew his man.
1462	
1463	AJAX	O, meaning you. I will go learn more of it.

1471	
1472	
1473	ACT II
1474	
1475	
1476	
1477	SCENE II	Troy. A room in Priam's palace.
1478	
1479	
1480	[Enter PRIAM, HECTOR, TROILUS, PARIS, and HELENUS]
1481	
1482	PRIAM	After so many hours, lives, speeches spent,
1483	Thus once again says Nestor from the Greeks:
1484	'Deliver Helen, and all damage else--
1485	As honour, loss of time, travail, expense,
1486	Wounds, friends, and what else dear that is consumed
1487	In hot digestion of this cormorant war--
1488	Shall be struck off.' Hector, what say you to't?
1489	
1490	HECTOR	Though no man lesser fears the Greeks than I
1491	As far as toucheth my particular,
1492	Yet, dread Priam,
1493	There is no lady of more softer bowels,
1494	More spongy to suck in the sense of fear,
1495	More ready to cry out 'Who knows what follows?'
1496	Than Hector is: the wound of peace is surety,
1497	Surety secure; but modest doubt is call'd
1498	The beacon of the wise, the tent that searches
1499	To the bottom of the worst. Let Helen go:
1500	Since the first sword was drawn about this question,
1501	Every tithe soul, 'mongst many thousand dismes,
1502	Hath been as dear as Helen; I mean, of ours:
1503	If we have lost so many tenths of ours,
1504	To guard a thing not ours nor worth to us,
1505	Had it our name, the value of one ten,
1506	What merit's in that reason which denies
1507	The yielding of her up?
1508	
1509	TROILUS	Fie, fie, my brother!
1510	Weigh you the worth and honour of a king
1511	So great as our dread father in a scale
1512	Of common ounces? will you with counters sum
1513	The past proportion of his infinite?
1514	And buckle in a waist most fathomless
1515	With spans and inches so diminutive
1516	As fears and reasons? fie, for godly shame!
1517	
1518	HELENUS	No marvel, though you bite so sharp at reasons,
1519	You are so empty of them. Should not our father
1520	Bear the great sway of his affairs with reasons,
1521	Because your speech hath none that tells him so?
1522	
1523	TROILUS	You are for dreams and slumbers, brother priest;
1524	You fur your gloves with reason. Here are
1525	your reasons:
1526	You know an enemy intends you harm;
1527	You know a sword employ'd is perilous,
1528	And reason flies the object of all harm:
1529	Who marvels then, when Helenus beholds
1530	A Grecian and his sword, if he do set
1531	The very wings of reason to his heels
1532	And fly like chidden Mercury from Jove,
1533	Or like a star disorb'd? Nay, if we talk of reason,
1534	Let's shut our gates and sleep: manhood and honour
1535	Should have hare-hearts, would they but fat
1536	their thoughts
1537	With this cramm'd reason: reason and respect
1538	Make livers pale and lustihood deject.
1539	
1540	HECTOR	Brother, she is not worth what she doth cost
1541	The holding.
1542	
1543	TROILUS	                  What is aught, but as 'tis valued?
1544	
1545	HECTOR	But value dwells not in particular will;
1546	It holds his estimate and dignity
1547	As well wherein 'tis precious of itself
1548	As in the prizer: 'tis mad idolatry
1549	To make the service greater than the god
1550	And the will dotes that is attributive
1551	To what infectiously itself affects,
1552	Without some image of the affected merit.
1553	
1554	TROILUS	I take to-day a wife, and my election
1555	Is led on in the conduct of my will;
1556	My will enkindled by mine eyes and ears,
1557	Two traded pilots 'twixt the dangerous shores
1558	Of will and judgment: how may I avoid,
1559	Although my will distaste what it elected,
1560	The wife I chose? there can be no evasion
1561	To blench from this and to stand firm by honour:
1562	We turn not back the silks upon the merchant,
1563	When we have soil'd them, nor the remainder viands
1564	We do not throw in unrespective sieve,
1565	Because we now are full. It was thought meet
1566	Paris should do some vengeance on the Greeks:
1567	Your breath of full consent bellied his sails;
1568	The seas and winds, old wranglers, took a truce
1569	And did him service: he touch'd the ports desired,
1570	And for an old aunt whom the Greeks held captive,
1571	He brought a Grecian queen, whose youth and freshness
1572	Wrinkles Apollo's, and makes stale the morning.
1573	Why keep we her? the Grecians keep our aunt:
1574	Is she worth keeping? why, she is a pearl,
1575	Whose price hath launch'd above a thousand ships,
1576	And turn'd crown'd kings to merchants.
1577	If you'll avouch 'twas wisdom Paris went--
1578	As you must needs, for you all cried 'Go, go,'--
1579	If you'll confess he brought home noble prize--
1580	As you must needs, for you all clapp'd your hands
1581	And cried 'Inestimable!'--why do you now
1582	The issue of your proper wisdoms rate,
1583	And do a deed that fortune never did,
1584	Beggar the estimation which you prized
1585	Richer than sea and land? O, theft most base,
1586	That we have stol'n what we do fear to keep!
1587	But, thieves, unworthy of a thing so stol'n,
1588	That in their country did them that disgrace,
1589	We fear to warrant in our native place!
1590	
1591	CASSANDRA	[Within]  Cry, Trojans, cry!
1592	
1593	PRIAM	What noise? what shriek is this?
1594	
1595	TROILUS	'Tis our mad sister, I do know her voice.
1596	
1597	CASSANDRA	[Within]  Cry, Trojans!
1598	
1599	HECTOR	It is Cassandra.
1600	
1601	[Enter CASSANDRA, raving]
1602	
1603	CASSANDRA	Cry, Trojans, cry! lend me ten thousand eyes,
1604	And I will fill them with prophetic tears.
1605	
1606	HECTOR	Peace, sister, peace!
1607	
1608	CASSANDRA	Virgins and boys, mid-age and wrinkled eld,
1609	Soft infancy, that nothing canst but cry,
1610	Add to my clamours! let us pay betimes
1611	A moiety of that mass of moan to come.
1612	Cry, Trojans, cry! practise your eyes with tears!
1613	Troy must not be, nor goodly Ilion stand;
1614	Our firebrand brother, Paris, burns us all.
1615	Cry, Trojans, cry! a Helen and a woe:
1616	Cry, cry! Troy burns, or else let Helen go.
1617	
1618	[Exit]
1619	
1620	HECTOR	Now, youthful Troilus, do not these high strains
1621	Of divination in our sister work
1622	Some touches of remorse? or is your blood
1623	So madly hot that no discourse of reason,
1624	Nor fear of bad success in a bad cause,
1625	Can qualify the same?
1626	
1627	TROILUS	Why, brother Hector,
1628	We may not think the justness of each act
1629	Such and no other than event doth form it,
1630	Nor once deject the courage of our minds,
1631	Because Cassandra's mad: her brain-sick raptures
1632	Cannot distaste the goodness of a quarrel
1633	Which hath our several honours all engaged
1634	To make it gracious. For my private part,
1635	I am no more touch'd than all Priam's sons:
1636	And Jove forbid there should be done amongst us
1637	Such things as might offend the weakest spleen
1638	To fight for and maintain!
1639	
1640	PARIS	Else might the world convince of levity
1641	As well my undertakings as your counsels:
1642	But I attest the gods, your full consent
1643	Gave wings to my propension and cut off
1644	All fears attending on so dire a project.
1645	For what, alas, can these my single arms?
1646	What Propugnation is in one man's valour,
1647	To stand the push and enmity of those
1648	This quarrel would excite? Yet, I protest,
1649	Were I alone to pass the difficulties
1650	And had as ample power as I have will,
1651	Paris should ne'er retract what he hath done,
1652	Nor faint in the pursuit.
1653	
1654	PRIAM	Paris, you speak
1655	Like one besotted on your sweet delights:
1656	You have the honey still, but these the gall;
1657	So to be valiant is no praise at all.
1658	
1659	PARIS	Sir, I propose not merely to myself
1660	The pleasures such a beauty brings with it;
1661	But I would have the soil of her fair rape
1662	Wiped off, in honourable keeping her.
1663	What treason were it to the ransack'd queen,
1664	Disgrace to your great worths and shame to me,
1665	Now to deliver her possession up
1666	On terms of base compulsion! Can it be
1667	That so degenerate a strain as this
1668	Should once set footing in your generous bosoms?
1669	There's not the meanest spirit on our party
1670	Without a heart to dare or sword to draw
1671	When Helen is defended, nor none so noble
1672	Whose life were ill bestow'd or death unfamed
1673	Where Helen is the subject; then, I say,
1674	Well may we fight for her whom, we know well,
1675	The world's large spaces cannot parallel.
1676	
1677	HECTOR	Paris and Troilus, you have both said well,
1678	And on the cause and question now in hand
1679	Have glozed, but superficially: not much
1680	Unlike young men, whom Aristotle thought
1681	Unfit to hear moral philosophy:
1682	The reasons you allege do more conduce
1683	To the hot passion of distemper'd blood
1684	Than to make up a free determination
1685	'Twixt right and wrong, for pleasure and revenge
1686	Have ears more deaf than adders to the voice
1687	Of any true decision. Nature craves
1688	All dues be render'd to their owners: now,
1689	What nearer debt in all humanity
1690	Than wife is to the husband? If this law
1691	Of nature be corrupted through affection,
1692	And that great minds, of partial indulgence
1693	To their benumbed wills, resist the same,
1694	There is a law in each well-order'd nation
1695	To curb those raging appetites that are
1696	Most disobedient and refractory.
1697	If Helen then be wife to Sparta's king,
1698	As it is known she is, these moral laws
1699	Of nature and of nations speak aloud
1700	To have her back return'd: thus to persist
1701	In doing wrong extenuates not wrong,
1702	But makes it much more heavy. Hector's opinion
1703	Is this in way of truth; yet ne'ertheless,
1704	My spritely brethren, I propend to you
1705	In resolution to keep Helen still,
1706	For 'tis a cause that hath no mean dependance
1707	Upon our joint and several dignities.
1708	
1709	TROILUS	Why, there you touch'd the life of our design:
1710	Were it not glory that we more affected
1711	Than the performance of our heaving spleens,
1712	I would not wish a drop of Trojan blood
1713	Spent more in her defence. But, worthy Hector,
1714	She is a theme of honour and renown,
1715	A spur to valiant and magnanimous deeds,
1716	Whose present courage may beat down our foes,
1717	And fame in time to come canonize us;
1718	For, I presume, brave Hector would not lose
1719	So rich advantage of a promised glory
1720	As smiles upon the forehead of this action
1721	For the wide world's revenue.
1722	
1723	HECTOR	I am yours,
1724	You valiant offspring of great Priamus.
1725	I have a roisting challenge sent amongst
1726	The dun and factious nobles of the Greeks
1727	Will strike amazement to their drowsy spirits:
1728	I was advertised their great general slept,
1729	Whilst emulation in the army crept:
1730	This, I presume, will wake him.
1731

1739	
1740	ACT II
1741	
1742	
1743	
1744	SCENE III	The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
1745	
1746	
1747	[Enter THERSITES, solus]
1748	
1749	THERSITES	How now, Thersites! what lost in the labyrinth of
1750	thy fury! Shall the elephant Ajax carry it thus? He
1751	beats me, and I rail at him: O, worthy satisfaction!
1752	would it were otherwise; that I could beat him,
1753	whilst he railed at me. 'Sfoot, I'll learn to
1754	conjure and raise devils, but I'll see some issue of
1755	my spiteful execrations. Then there's Achilles, a
1756	rare enginer! If Troy be not taken till these two
1757	undermine it, the walls will stand till they fall of
1758	themselves. O thou great thunder-darter of Olympus,
1759	forget that thou art Jove, the king of gods and,
1760	Mercury, lose all the serpentine craft of thy
1761	caduceus, if ye take not that little, little less
1762	than little wit from them that they have! which
1763	short-armed ignorance itself knows is so abundant
1764	scarce, it will not in circumvention deliver a fly
1765	from a spider, without drawing their massy irons and
1766	cutting the web. After this, the vengeance on the
1767	whole camp! or rather, the bone-ache! for that,
1768	methinks, is the curse dependent on those that war
1769	for a placket. I have said my prayers and devil Envy
1770	say Amen. What ho! my Lord Achilles!
1771	
1772	[Enter PATROCLUS]
1773	
1774	PATROCLUS	Who's there? Thersites! Good Thersites, come in and rail.
1775	
1776	THERSITES	If I could have remembered a gilt counterfeit, thou
1777	wouldst not have slipped out of my contemplation: but
1778	it is no matter; thyself upon thyself! The common
1779	curse of mankind, folly and ignorance, be thine in
1780	great revenue! heaven bless thee from a tutor, and
1781	discipline come not near thee! Let thy blood be thy
1782	direction till thy death! then if she that lays thee
1783	out says thou art a fair corse, I'll be sworn and
1784	sworn upon't she never shrouded any but lazars.
1785	Amen. Where's Achilles?
1786	
1787	PATROCLUS	What, art thou devout? wast thou in prayer?
1788	
1789	THERSITES	Ay: the heavens hear me!
1790	
1791	[Enter ACHILLES]
1792	
1793	ACHILLES	Who's there?
1794	
1795	PATROCLUS	Thersites, my lord.
1796	
1797	ACHILLES	Where, where? Art thou come? why, my cheese, my
1798	digestion, why hast thou not served thyself in to
1799	my table so many meals? Come, what's Agamemnon?
1800	
1801	THERSITES	Thy commander, Achilles. Then tell me, Patroclus,
1802	what's Achilles?
1803	
1804	PATROCLUS	Thy lord, Thersites: then tell me, I pray thee,
1805	what's thyself?
1806	
1807	THERSITES	Thy knower, Patroclus: then tell me, Patroclus,
1808	what art thou?
1809	
1810	PATROCLUS	Thou mayst tell that knowest.
1811	
1812	ACHILLES	O, tell, tell.
1813	
1814	THERSITES	I'll decline the whole question. Agamemnon commands
1815	Achilles; Achilles is my lord; I am Patroclus'
1816	knower, and Patroclus is a fool.
1817	
1818	PATROCLUS	You rascal!
1819	
1820	THERSITES	Peace, fool! I have not done.
1821	
1822	ACHILLES	He is a privileged man. Proceed, Thersites.
1823	
1824	THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool; Achilles is a fool; Thersites
1825	is a fool, and, as aforesaid, Patroclus is a fool.
1826	
1827	ACHILLES	Derive this; come.
1828	
1829	THERSITES	Agamemnon is a fool to offer to command Achilles;
1830	Achilles is a fool to be commanded of Agamemnon;
1831	Thersites is a fool to serve such a fool, and
1832	Patroclus is a fool positive.
1833	
1834	PATROCLUS	Why am I a fool?
1835	
1836	THERSITES	Make that demand of the prover. It suffices me thou
1837	art. Look you, who comes here?
1838	
1839	ACHILLES	Patroclus, I'll speak with nobody.
1840	Come in with me, Thersites.
1841	
1842	[Exit]
1843	
1844	THERSITES	Here is such patchery, such juggling and such
1845	knavery! all the argument is a cuckold and a
1846	whore; a good quarrel to draw emulous factions
1847	and bleed to death upon. Now, the dry serpigo on
1848	the subject! and war and lechery confound all!
1849	
1850	[Exit]
1851	
1852	[Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, NESTOR, DIOMEDES, and AJAX]
1853	
1854	AGAMEMNON	Where is Achilles?
1855	
1856	PATROCLUS	Within his tent; but ill disposed, my lord.
1857	
1858	AGAMEMNON	Let it be known to him that we are here.
1859	He shent our messengers; and we lay by
1860	Our appertainments, visiting of him:
1861	Let him be told so; lest perchance he think
1862	We dare not move the question of our place,
1863	Or know not what we are.
1864	
1865	PATROCLUS	I shall say so to him.
1866	
1867	[Exit]
1868	
1869	ULYSSES	We saw him at the opening of his tent:
1870	He is not sick.
1871	
1872	AJAX	Yes, lion-sick, sick of proud heart: you may call it
1873	melancholy, if you will favour the man; but, by my
1874	head, 'tis pride: but why, why? let him show us the
1875	cause. A word, my lord.
1876	
1877	[Takes AGAMEMNON aside]
1878	
1879	NESTOR	What moves Ajax thus to bay at him?
1880	
1881	ULYSSES	Achilles hath inveigled his fool from him.
1882	
1883	NESTOR	Who, Thersites?
1884	
1885	ULYSSES	He.
1886	
1887	NESTOR	Then will Ajax lack matter, if he have lost his argument.
1888	
1889	ULYSSES	No, you see, he is his argument that has his
1890	argument, Achilles.
1891	
1892	NESTOR	All the better; their fraction is more our wish than
1893	their faction: but it was a strong composure a fool
1894	could disunite.
1895	
1896	ULYSSES	The amity that wisdom knits not, folly may easily
1897	untie. Here comes Patroclus.
1898	
1899	[Re-enter PATROCLUS]
1900	
1901	NESTOR	No Achilles with him.
1902	
1903	ULYSSES	The elephant hath joints, but none for courtesy:
1904	his legs are legs for necessity, not for flexure.
1905	
1906	PATROCLUS	Achilles bids me say, he is much sorry,
1907	If any thing more than your sport and pleasure
1908	Did move your greatness and this noble state
1909	To call upon him; he hopes it is no other
1910	But for your health and your digestion sake,
1911	And after-dinner's breath.
1912	
1913	AGAMEMNON	Hear you, Patroclus:
1914	We are too well acquainted with these answers:
1915	But his evasion, wing'd thus swift with scorn,
1916	Cannot outfly our apprehensions.
1917	Much attribute he hath, and much the reason
1918	Why we ascribe it to him; yet all his virtues,
1919	Not virtuously on his own part beheld,
1920	Do in our eyes begin to lose their gloss,
1921	Yea, like fair fruit in an unwholesome dish,
1922	Are like to rot untasted. Go and tell him,
1923	We come to speak with him; and you shall not sin,
1924	If you do say we think him over-proud
1925	And under-honest, in self-assumption greater
1926	Than in the note of judgment; and worthier
1927	than himself
1928	Here tend the savage strangeness he puts on,
1929	Disguise the holy strength of their command,
1930	And underwrite in an observing kind
1931	His humorous predominance; yea, watch
1932	His pettish lunes, his ebbs, his flows, as if
1933	The passage and whole carriage of this action
1934	Rode on his tide. Go tell him this, and add,
1935	That if he overhold his price so much,
1936	We'll none of him; but let him, like an engine
1937	Not portable, lie under this report:
1938	'Bring action hither, this cannot go to war:
1939	A stirring dwarf we do allowance give
1940	Before a sleeping giant.' Tell him so.
1941	
1942	PATROCLUS	I shall; and bring his answer presently.
1943	
1944	[Exit]
1945	
1946	AGAMEMNON	In second voice we'll not be satisfied;
1947	We come to speak with him. Ulysses, enter you.
1948	
1949	[Exit ULYSSES]
1950	
1951	AJAX	What is he more than another?
1952	
1953	AGAMEMNON	No more than what he thinks he is.
1954	
1955	AJAX	Is he so much? Do you not think he thinks himself a
1956	better man than I am?
1957	
1958	AGAMEMNON	No question.
1959	
1960	AJAX	Will you subscribe his thought, and say he is?
1961	
1962	AGAMEMNON	No, noble Ajax; you are as strong, as valiant, as
1963	wise, no less noble, much more gentle, and altogether
1964	more tractable.
1965	
1966	AJAX	Why should a man be proud? How doth pride grow? I
1967	know not what pride is.
1968	
1969	AGAMEMNON	Your mind is the clearer, Ajax, and your virtues the
1970	fairer. He that is proud eats up himself: pride is
1971	his own glass, his own trumpet, his own chronicle;
1972	and whatever praises itself but in the deed, devours
1973	the deed in the praise.
1974	
1975	AJAX	I do hate a proud man, as I hate the engendering of toads.
1976	
1977	NESTOR	Yet he loves himself: is't not strange?
1978	
1979	[Aside]
1980	
1981	[Re-enter ULYSSES]
1982	
1983	ULYSSES	Achilles will not to the field to-morrow.
1984	
1985	AGAMEMNON	What's his excuse?
1986	
1987	ULYSSES	                  He doth rely on none,
1988	But carries on the stream of his dispose
1989	Without observance or respect of any,
1990	In will peculiar and in self-admission.
1991	
1992	AGAMEMNON	Why will he not upon our fair request
1993	Untent his person and share the air with us?
1994	
1995	ULYSSES	Things small as nothing, for request's sake only,
1996	He makes important: possess'd he is with greatness,
1997	And speaks not to himself but with a pride
1998	That quarrels at self-breath: imagined worth
1999	Holds in his blood such swoln and hot discourse
2000	That 'twixt his mental and his active parts
2001	Kingdom'd Achilles in commotion rages
2002	And batters down himself: what should I say?
2003	He is so plaguy proud that the death-tokens of it
2004	Cry 'No recovery.'
2005	
2006	AGAMEMNON	                  Let Ajax go to him.
2007	Dear lord, go you and greet him in his tent:
2008	'Tis said he holds you well, and will be led
2009	At your request a little from himself.
2010	
2011	ULYSSES	O Agamemnon, let it not be so!
2012	We'll consecrate the steps that Ajax makes
2013	When they go from Achilles: shall the proud lord
2014	That bastes his arrogance with his own seam
2015	And never suffers matter of the world
2016	Enter his thoughts, save such as do revolve
2017	And ruminate himself, shall he be worshipp'd
2018	Of that we hold an idol more than he?
2019	No, this thrice worthy and right valiant lord
2020	Must not so stale his palm, nobly acquired;
2021	Nor, by my will, assubjugate his merit,
2022	As amply titled as Achilles is,
2023	By going to Achilles:
2024	That were to enlard his fat already pride
2025	And add more coals to Cancer when he burns
2026	With entertaining great Hyperion.
2027	This lord go to him! Jupiter forbid,
2028	And say in thunder 'Achilles go to him.'
2029	
2030	NESTOR	[Aside to DIOMEDES]  O, this is well; he rubs the
2031	vein of him.
2032	
2033	DIOMEDES	[Aside to NESTOR]  And how his silence drinks up
2034	this applause!
2035	
2036	AJAX	If I go to him, with my armed fist I'll pash him o'er the face.
2037	
2038	AGAMEMNON	O, no, you shall not go.
2039	
2040	AJAX	An a' be proud with me, I'll pheeze his pride:
2041	Let me go to him.
2042	
2043	ULYSSES	Not for the worth that hangs upon our quarrel.
2044	
2045	AJAX	A paltry, insolent fellow!
2046	
2047	NESTOR	How he describes himself!
2048	
2049	AJAX	Can he not be sociable?
2050	
2051	ULYSSES	The raven chides blackness.
2052	
2053	AJAX	I'll let his humours blood.
2054	
2055	AGAMEMNON	He will be the physician that should be the patient.
2056	
2057	AJAX	An all men were o' my mind,--
2058	
2059	ULYSSES	Wit would be out of fashion.
2060	
2061	AJAX	A' should not bear it so, a' should eat swords first:
2062	shall pride carry it?
2063	
2064	NESTOR	An 'twould, you'ld carry half.
2065	
2066	ULYSSES	A' would have ten shares.
2067	
2068	AJAX	I will knead him; I'll make him supple.
2069	
2070	NESTOR	He's not yet through warm: force him with praises:
2071	pour in, pour in; his ambition is dry.
2072	
2073	ULYSSES	[To AGAMEMNON]  My lord, you feed too much on this dislike.
2074	
2075	NESTOR	Our noble general, do not do so.
2076	
2077	DIOMEDES	You must prepare to fight without Achilles.
2078	
2079	ULYSSES	Why, 'tis this naming of him does him harm.
2080	Here is a man--but 'tis before his face;
2081	I will be silent.
2082	
2083	NESTOR	                  Wherefore should you so?
2084	He is not emulous, as Achilles is.
2085	
2086	ULYSSES	Know the whole world, he is as valiant.
2087	
2088	AJAX	A whoreson dog, that shall pelter thus with us!
2089	Would he were a Trojan!
2090	
2091	NESTOR	What a vice were it in Ajax now,--
2092	
2093	ULYSSES	If he were proud,--
2094	
2095	DIOMEDES	Or covetous of praise,--
2096	
2097	ULYSSES	Ay, or surly borne,--
2098	
2099	DIOMEDES	Or strange, or self-affected!
2100	
2101	ULYSSES	Thank the heavens, lord, thou art of sweet composure;
2102	Praise him that got thee, she that gave thee suck:
2103	Famed be thy tutor, and thy parts of nature
2104	Thrice famed, beyond all erudition:
2105	But he that disciplined thy arms to fight,
2106	Let Mars divide eternity in twain,
2107	And give him half: and, for thy vigour,
2108	Bull-bearing Milo his addition yield
2109	To sinewy Ajax. I will not praise thy wisdom,
2110	Which, like a bourn, a pale, a shore, confines
2111	Thy spacious and dilated parts: here's Nestor;
2112	Instructed by the antiquary times,
2113	He must, he is, he cannot but be wise:
2114	Put pardon, father Nestor, were your days
2115	As green as Ajax' and your brain so temper'd,
2116	You should not have the eminence of him,
2117	But be as Ajax.
2118	
2119	AJAX	                  Shall I call you father?
2120	
2121	NESTOR	Ay, my good son.
2122	
2123	DIOMEDES	                  Be ruled by him, Lord Ajax.
2124	
2125	ULYSSES	There is no tarrying here; the hart Achilles
2126	Keeps thicket. Please it our great general
2127	To call together all his state of war;
2128	Fresh kings are come to Troy: to-morrow
2129	We must with all our main of power stand fast:
2130	And here's a lord,--come knights from east to west,
2131	And cull their flower, Ajax shall cope the best.
2132	
2133	AGAMEMNON	Go we to council. Let Achilles sleep:
2134	Light boats sail swift, though greater hulks draw deep.
2135

2142	
2143	
2144	ACT III
2145	
2146	
2147	
2148	SCENE I	Troy. Priam's palace.
2149	
2150	
2151	[Enter a Servant and PANDARUS]
2152	
2153	PANDARUS	Friend, you! pray you, a word: do not you follow
2154	the young Lord Paris?
2155	
2156	Servant	Ay, sir, when he goes before me.
2157	
2158	PANDARUS	You depend upon him, I mean?
2159	
2160	Servant	Sir, I do depend upon the lord.
2161	
2162	PANDARUS	You depend upon a noble gentleman; I must needs
2163	praise him.
2164	
2165	Servant	The lord be praised!
2166	
2167	PANDARUS	You know me, do you not?
2168	
2169	Servant	Faith, sir, superficially.
2170	
2171	PANDARUS	Friend, know me better; I am the Lord Pandarus.
2172	
2173	Servant	I hope I shall know your honour better.
2174	
2175	PANDARUS	I do desire it.
2176	
2177	Servant	You are in the state of grace.
2178	
2179	PANDARUS	Grace! not so, friend: honour and lordship are my titles.
2180	
2181	[Music within]
2182	
2183	What music is this?
2184	
2185	Servant	I do but partly know, sir: it is music in parts.
2186	
2187	PANDARUS	Know you the musicians?
2188	
2189	Servant	Wholly, sir.
2190	
2191	PANDARUS	Who play they to?
2192	
2193	Servant	To the hearers, sir.
2194	
2195	PANDARUS	At whose pleasure, friend
2196	
2197	Servant	At mine, sir, and theirs that love music.
2198	
2199	PANDARUS	Command, I mean, friend.
2200	
2201	Servant	Who shall I command, sir?
2202	
2203	PANDARUS	Friend, we understand not one another: I am too
2204	courtly and thou art too cunning. At whose request
2205	do these men play?
2206	
2207	Servant	That's to 't indeed, sir: marry, sir, at the request
2208	of Paris my lord, who's there in person; with him,
2209	the mortal Venus, the heart-blood of beauty, love's
2210	invisible soul,--
2211	
2212	PANDARUS	Who, my cousin Cressida?
2213	
2214	Servant	No, sir, Helen: could you not find out that by her
2215	attributes?
2216	
2217	PANDARUS	It should seem, fellow, that thou hast not seen the
2218	Lady Cressida. I come to speak with Paris from the
2219	Prince Troilus: I will make a complimental assault
2220	upon him, for my business seethes.
2221	
2222	Servant	Sodden business! there's a stewed phrase indeed!
2223	
2224	[Enter PARIS and HELEN, attended]
2225	
2226	PANDARUS	Fair be to you, my lord, and to all this fair
2227	company! fair desires, in all fair measure,
2228	fairly guide them! especially to you, fair queen!
2229	fair thoughts be your fair pillow!
2230	
2231	HELEN	Dear lord, you are full of fair words.
2232	
2233	PANDARUS	You speak your fair pleasure, sweet queen. Fair
2234	prince, here is good broken music.
2235	
2236	PARIS	You have broke it, cousin: and, by my life, you
2237	shall make it whole again; you shall piece it out
2238	with a piece of your performance. Nell, he is full
2239	of harmony.
2240	
2241	PANDARUS	Truly, lady, no.
2242	
2243	HELEN	O, sir,--
2244	
2245	PANDARUS	Rude, in sooth; in good sooth, very rude.
2246	
2247	PARIS	Well said, my lord! well, you say so in fits.
2248	
2249	PANDARUS	I have business to my lord, dear queen. My lord,
2250	will you vouchsafe me a word?
2251	
2252	HELEN	Nay, this shall not hedge us out: we'll hear you
2253	sing, certainly.
2254	
2255	PANDARUS	Well, sweet queen. you are pleasant with me. But,
2256	marry, thus, my lord: my dear lord and most esteemed
2257	friend, your brother Troilus,--
2258	
2259	HELEN	My Lord Pandarus; honey-sweet lord,--
2260	
2261	PANDARUS	Go to, sweet queen, to go:--commends himself most
2262	affectionately to you,--
2263	
2264	HELEN	You shall not bob us out of our melody: if you do,
2265	our melancholy upon your head!
2266	
2267	PANDARUS	Sweet queen, sweet queen! that's a sweet queen, i' faith.
2268	
2269	HELEN	And to make a sweet lady sad is a sour offence.
2270	
2271	PANDARUS	Nay, that shall not serve your turn; that shall not,
2272	in truth, la. Nay, I care not for such words; no,
2273	no. And, my lord, he desires you, that if the king
2274	call for him at supper, you will make his excuse.
2275	
2276	HELEN	My Lord Pandarus,--
2277	
2278	PANDARUS	What says my sweet queen, my very very sweet queen?
2279	
2280	PARIS	What exploit's in hand? where sups he to-night?
2281	
2282	HELEN	Nay, but, my lord,--
2283	
2284	PANDARUS	What says my sweet queen? My cousin will fall out
2285	with you. You must not know where he sups.
2286	
2287	PARIS	I'll lay my life, with my disposer Cressida.
2288	
2289	PANDARUS	No, no, no such matter; you are wide: come, your
2290	disposer is sick.
2291	
2292	PARIS	Well, I'll make excuse.
2293	
2294	PANDARUS	Ay, good my lord. Why should you say Cressida? no,
2295	your poor disposer's sick.
2296	
2297	PARIS	I spy.
2298	
2299	PANDARUS	You spy! what do you spy? Come, give me an
2300	instrument. Now, sweet queen.
2301	
2302	HELEN	Why, this is kindly done.
2303	
2304	PANDARUS	My niece is horribly in love with a thing you have,
2305	sweet queen.
2306	
2307	HELEN	She shall have it, my lord, if it be not my lord Paris.
2308	
2309	PANDARUS	He! no, she'll none of him; they two are twain.
2310	
2311	HELEN	Falling in, after falling out, may make them three.
2312	
2313	PANDARUS	Come, come, I'll hear no more of this; I'll sing
2314	you a song now.
2315	
2316	HELEN	Ay, ay, prithee now. By my troth, sweet lord, thou
2317	hast a fine forehead.
2318	
2319	PANDARUS	Ay, you may, you may.
2320	
2321	HELEN	Let thy song be love: this love will undo us all.
2322	O Cupid, Cupid, Cupid!
2323	
2324	PANDARUS	Love! ay, that it shall, i' faith.
2325	
2326	PARIS	Ay, good now, love, love, nothing but love.
2327	
2328	PANDARUS	In good troth, it begins so.
2329	
2330	[Sings]
2331	
2332	Love, love, nothing but love, still more!
2333	For, O, love's bow
2334	Shoots buck and doe:
2335	The shaft confounds,
2336	Not that it wounds,
2337	But tickles still the sore.
2338	These lovers cry Oh! oh! they die!
2339	Yet that which seems the wound to kill,
2340	Doth turn oh! oh! to ha! ha! he!
2341	So dying love lives still:
2342	Oh! oh! a while, but ha! ha! ha!
2343	Oh! oh! groans out for ha! ha! ha!
2344	Heigh-ho!
2345	
2346	HELEN	In love, i' faith, to the very tip of the nose.
2347	
2348	PARIS	He eats nothing but doves, love, and that breeds hot
2349	blood, and hot blood begets hot thoughts, and hot
2350	thoughts beget hot deeds, and hot deeds is love.
2351	
2352	PANDARUS	Is this the generation of love? hot blood, hot
2353	thoughts, and hot deeds? Why, they are vipers:
2354	is love a generation of vipers? Sweet lord, who's
2355	a-field to-day?
2356	
2357	PARIS	Hector, Deiphobus, Helenus, Antenor, and all the
2358	gallantry of Troy: I  would fain have armed to-day,
2359	but my Nell would not have it so. How chance my
2360	brother Troilus went not?
2361	
2362	HELEN	He hangs the lip at something: you know all, Lord Pandarus.
2363	
2364	PANDARUS	Not I, honey-sweet queen. I long to hear how they
2365	sped to-day. You'll remember your brother's excuse?
2366	
2367	PARIS	To a hair.
2368	
2369	PANDARUS	Farewell, sweet queen.
2370	
2371	HELEN	Commend me to your niece.
2372	
2373	PANDARUS	I will, sweet queen.
2374	
2375	[Exit]
2376	
2377	[A retreat sounded]
2378	
2379	PARIS	They're come from field: let us to Priam's hall,
2380	To greet the warriors. Sweet Helen, I must woo you
2381	To help unarm our Hector: his stubborn buckles,
2382	With these your white enchanting fingers touch'd,
2383	Shall more obey than to the edge of steel
2384	Or force of Greekish sinews; you shall do more
2385	Than all the island kings,--disarm great Hector.
2386	
2387	HELEN	'Twill make us proud to be his servant, Paris;
2388	Yea, what he shall receive of us in duty
2389	Gives us more palm in beauty than we have,
2390	Yea, overshines ourself.
2391	
2392	PARIS	Sweet, above thought I love thee.
2393	
2394	[Exeunt]
2395	
2396	
2397	
2398	
2399	TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
2400	
2401	
2402	ACT III
2403	
2404	
2405	
2406	SCENE II	The same. Pandarus' orchard.
2407	
2408	
2409	[Enter PANDARUS and Troilus's Boy, meeting]
2410	
2411	PANDARUS	How now! where's thy master? at my cousin
2412	Cressida's?
2413	
2414	Boy	No, sir; he stays for you to conduct him thither.
2415	
2416	PANDARUS	O, here he comes.
2417	
2418	[Enter TROILUS]
2419	
2420	How now, how now!
2421	
2422	TROILUS	Sirrah, walk off.
2423	
2424	[Exit Boy]
2425	
2426	PANDARUS	Have you seen my cousin?
2427	
2428	TROILUS	No, Pandarus: I stalk about her door,
2429	Like a strange soul upon the Stygian banks
2430	Staying for waftage. O, be thou my Charon,
2431	And give me swift transportance to those fields
2432	Where I may wallow in the lily-beds
2433	Proposed for the deserver! O gentle Pandarus,
2434	From Cupid's shoulder pluck his painted wings
2435	And fly with me to Cressid!
2436	
2437	PANDARUS	Walk here i' the orchard, I'll bring her straight.
2438	
2439	[Exit]
2440	
2441	TROILUS	I am giddy; expectation whirls me round.
2442	The imaginary relish is so sweet
2443	That it enchants my sense: what will it be,
2444	When that the watery palate tastes indeed
2445	Love's thrice repured nectar? death, I fear me,
2446	Swooning destruction, or some joy too fine,
2447	Too subtle-potent, tuned too sharp in sweetness,
2448	For the capacity of my ruder powers:
2449	I fear it much; and I do fear besides,
2450	That I shall lose distinction in my joys;
2451	As doth a battle, when they charge on heaps
2452	The enemy flying.
2453	
2454	[Re-enter PANDARUS]
2455	
2456	PANDARUS	She's making her ready, she'll come straight: you
2457	must be witty now. She does so blush, and fetches
2458	her wind so short, as if she were frayed with a
2459	sprite: I'll fetch her. It is the prettiest
2460	villain: she fetches her breath as short as a
2461	new-ta'en sparrow.
2462	
2463	[Exit]
2464	
2465	TROILUS	Even such a passion doth embrace my bosom:
2466	My heart beats thicker than a feverous pulse;
2467	And all my powers do their bestowing lose,
2468	Like vassalage at unawares encountering
2469	The eye of majesty.
2470	
2471	[Re-enter PANDARUS with CRESSIDA]
2472	
2473	PANDARUS	Come, come, what need you blush? shame's a baby.
2474	Here she is now: swear the oaths now to her that
2475	you have sworn to me. What, are you gone again?
2476	you must be watched ere you be made tame, must you?
2477	Come your ways, come your ways; an you draw backward,
2478	we'll put you i' the fills. Why do you not speak to
2479	her? Come, draw this curtain, and let's see your
2480	picture. Alas the day, how loath you are to offend
2481	daylight! an 'twere dark, you'ld close sooner.
2482	So, so; rub on, and kiss the mistress. How now!
2483	a kiss in fee-farm! build there, carpenter; the air
2484	is sweet. Nay, you shall fight your hearts out ere
2485	I part you. The falcon as the tercel, for all the
2486	ducks i' the river: go to, go to.
2487	
2488	TROILUS	You have bereft me of all words, lady.
2489	
2490	PANDARUS	Words pay no debts, give her deeds: but she'll
2491	bereave you o' the deeds too, if she call your
2492	activity in question. What, billing again? Here's
2493	'In witness whereof the parties interchangeably'--
2494	Come in, come in: I'll go get a fire.
2495	
2496	[Exit]
2497	
2498	CRESSIDA	Will you walk in, my lord?
2499	
2500	TROILUS	O Cressida, how often have I wished me thus!
2501	
2502	CRESSIDA	Wished, my lord! The gods grant,--O my lord!
2503	
2504	TROILUS	What should they grant? what makes this pretty
2505	abruption? What too curious dreg espies my sweet
2506	lady in the fountain of our love?
2507	
2508	CRESSIDA	More dregs than water, if my fears have eyes.
2509	
2510	TROILUS	Fears make devils of cherubims; they never see truly.
2511	
2512	CRESSIDA	Blind fear, that seeing reason leads, finds safer
2513	footing than blind reason stumbling without fear: to
2514	fear the worst oft cures the worse.
2515	
2516	TROILUS	O, let my lady apprehend no fear: in all Cupid's
2517	pageant there is presented no monster.
2518	
2519	CRESSIDA	Nor nothing monstrous neither?
2520	
2521	TROILUS	Nothing, but our undertakings; when we vow to weep
2522	seas, live in fire, eat rocks, tame tigers; thinking
2523	it harder for our mistress to devise imposition
2524	enough than for us to undergo any difficulty imposed.
2525	This is the monstruosity in love, lady, that the will
2526	is infinite and the execution confined, that the
2527	desire is boundless and the act a slave to limit.
2528	
2529	CRESSIDA	They say all lovers swear more performance than they
2530	are able and yet reserve an ability that they never
2531	perform, vowing more than the perfection of ten and
2532	discharging less than the tenth part of one. They
2533	that have the voice of lions and the act of hares,
2534	are they not monsters?
2535	
2536	TROILUS	Are there such? such are not we: praise us as we
2537	are tasted, allow us as we prove; our head shall go
2538	bare till merit crown it: no perfection in reversion
2539	shall have a praise in present: we will not name
2540	desert before his birth, and, being born, his addition
2541	shall be humble. Few words to fair faith: Troilus
2542	shall be such to Cressid as what envy can say worst
2543	shall be a mock for his truth, and what truth can
2544	speak truest not truer than Troilus.
2545	
2546	CRESSIDA	Will you walk in, my lord?
2547	
2548	[Re-enter PANDARUS]
2549	
2550	PANDARUS	What, blushing still? have you not done talking yet?
2551	
2552	CRESSIDA	Well, uncle, what folly I commit, I dedicate to you.
2553	
2554	PANDARUS	I thank you for that: if my lord get a boy of you,
2555	you'll give him me. Be true to my lord: if he
2556	flinch, chide me for it.
2557	
2558	TROILUS	You know now your hostages; your uncle's word and my
2559	firm faith.
2560	
2561	PANDARUS	Nay, I'll give my word for her too: our kindred,
2562	though they be long ere they are wooed, they are
2563	constant being won: they are burs, I can tell you;
2564	they'll stick where they are thrown.
2565	
2566	CRESSIDA	Boldness comes to me now, and brings me heart.
2567	Prince Troilus, I have loved you night and day
2568	For many weary months.
2569	
2570	TROILUS	Why was my Cressid then so hard to win?
2571	
2572	CRESSIDA	Hard to seem won: but I was won, my lord,
2573	With the first glance that ever--pardon me--
2574	If I confess much, you will play the tyrant.
2575	I love you now; but not, till now, so much
2576	But I might master it: in faith, I lie;
2577	My thoughts were like unbridled children, grown
2578	Too headstrong for their mother. See, we fools!
2579	Why have I blabb'd? who shall be true to us,
2580	When we are so unsecret to ourselves?
2581	But, though I loved you well, I woo'd you not;
2582	And yet, good faith, I wish'd myself a man,
2583	Or that we women had men's privilege
2584	Of speaking first. Sweet, bid me hold my tongue,
2585	For in this rapture I shall surely speak
2586	The thing I shall repent. See, see, your silence,
2587	Cunning in dumbness, from my weakness draws
2588	My very soul of counsel! stop my mouth.
2589	
2590	TROILUS	And shall, albeit sweet music issues thence.
2591	
2592	PANDARUS	Pretty, i' faith.
2593	
2594	CRESSIDA	My lord, I do beseech you, pardon me;
2595	'Twas not my purpose, thus to beg a kiss:
2596	I am ashamed. O heavens! what have I done?
2597	For this time will I take my leave, my lord.
2598	
2599	TROILUS	Your leave, sweet Cressid!
2600	
2601	PANDARUS	Leave! an you take leave till to-morrow morning,--
2602	
2603	CRESSIDA	Pray you, content you.
2604	
2605	TROILUS	What offends you, lady?
2606	
2607	CRESSIDA	Sir, mine own company.
2608	
2609	TROILUS	You cannot shun Yourself.
2610	
2611	CRESSIDA	        Let me go and try:
2612	I have a kind of self resides with you;
2613	But an unkind self, that itself will leave,
2614	To be another's fool. I would be gone:
2615	Where is my wit? I know not what I speak.
2616	
2617	TROILUS	Well know they what they speak that speak so wisely.
2618	
2619	CRESSIDA	Perchance, my lord, I show more craft than love;
2620	And fell so roundly to a large confession,
2621	To angle for your thoughts: but you are wise,
2622	Or else you love not, for to be wise and love
2623	Exceeds man's might; that dwells with gods above.
2624	
2625	TROILUS	O that I thought it could be in a woman--
2626	As, if it can, I will presume in you--
2627	To feed for aye her ramp and flames of love;
2628	To keep her constancy in plight and youth,
2629	Outliving beauty's outward, with a mind
2630	That doth renew swifter than blood decays!
2631	Or that persuasion could but thus convince me,
2632	That my integrity and truth to you
2633	Might be affronted with the match and weight
2634	Of such a winnow'd purity in love;
2635	How were I then uplifted! but, alas!
2636	I am as true as truth's simplicity
2637	And simpler than the infancy of truth.
2638	
2639	CRESSIDA	In that I'll war with you.
2640	
2641	TROILUS	O virtuous fight,
2642	When right with right wars who shall be most right!
2643	True swains in love shall in the world to come
2644	Approve their truths by Troilus: when their rhymes,
2645	Full of protest, of oath and big compare,
2646	Want similes, truth tired with iteration,
2647	As true as steel, as plantage to the moon,
2648	As sun to day, as turtle to her mate,
2649	As iron to adamant, as earth to the centre,
2650	Yet, after all comparisons of truth,
2651	As truth's authentic author to be cited,
2652	'As true as Troilus' shall crown up the verse,
2653	And sanctify the numbers.
2654	
2655	CRESSIDA	Prophet may you be!
2656	If I be false, or swerve a hair from truth,
2657	When time is old and hath forgot itself,
2658	When waterdrops have worn the stones of Troy,
2659	And blind oblivion swallow'd cities up,
2660	And mighty states characterless are grated
2661	To dusty nothing, yet let memory,
2662	From false to false, among false maids in love,
2663	Upbraid my falsehood! when they've said 'as false
2664	As air, as water, wind, or sandy earth,
2665	As fox to lamb, as wolf to heifer's calf,
2666	Pard to the hind, or stepdame to her son,'
2667	'Yea,' let them say, to stick the heart of falsehood,
2668	'As false as Cressid.'
2669	
2670	PANDARUS	Go to, a bargain made: seal it, seal it; I'll be the
2671	witness. Here I hold your hand, here my cousin's.
2672	If ever you prove false one to another, since I have
2673	taken such pains to bring you together, let all
2674	pitiful goers-between be called to the world's end
2675	after my name; call them all Pandars; let all
2676	constant men be Troiluses, all false women Cressids,
2677	and all brokers-between Pandars! say, amen.
2678	
2679	TROILUS	Amen.
2680	
2681	CRESSIDA	Amen.
2682	
2683	PANDARUS	Amen. Whereupon I will show you a chamber with a
2684	bed; which bed, because it shall not speak of your
2685	pretty encounters, press it to death: away!
2686	And Cupid grant all tongue-tied maidens here
2687	Bed, chamber, Pandar to provide this gear!
2688	
2689	[Exeunt]

2697	ACT III
2698	
2699	
2700	
2701	SCENE III	The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
2702	
2703	
2704	[Enter AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES, DIOMEDES, NESTOR, AJAX,
2705	MENELAUS, and CALCHAS]
2706	
2707	CALCHAS	Now, princes, for the service I have done you,
2708	The advantage of the time prompts me aloud
2709	To call for recompense. Appear it to your mind
2710	That, through the sight I bear in things to love,
2711	I have abandon'd Troy, left my possession,
2712	Incurr'd a traitor's name; exposed myself,
2713	From certain and possess'd conveniences,
2714	To doubtful fortunes; sequestering from me all
2715	That time, acquaintance, custom and condition
2716	Made tame and most familiar to my nature,
2717	And here, to do you service, am become
2718	As new into the world, strange, unacquainted:
2719	I do beseech you, as in way of taste,
2720	To give me now a little benefit,
2721	Out of those many register'd in promise,
2722	Which, you say, live to come in my behalf.
2723	
2724	AGAMEMNON	What wouldst thou of us, Trojan? make demand.
2725	
2726	CALCHAS	You have a Trojan prisoner, call'd Antenor,
2727	Yesterday took: Troy holds him very dear.
2728	Oft have you--often have you thanks therefore--
2729	Desired my Cressid in right great exchange,
2730	Whom Troy hath still denied: but this Antenor,
2731	I know, is such a wrest in their affairs
2732	That their negotiations all must slack,
2733	Wanting his manage; and they will almost
2734	Give us a prince of blood, a son of Priam,
2735	In change of him: let him be sent, great princes,
2736	And he shall buy my daughter; and her presence
2737	Shall quite strike off all service I have done,
2738	In most accepted pain.
2739	
2740	AGAMEMNON	Let Diomedes bear him,
2741	And bring us Cressid hither: Calchas shall have
2742	What he requests of us. Good Diomed,
2743	Furnish you fairly for this interchange:
2744	Withal bring word if Hector will to-morrow
2745	Be answer'd in his challenge: Ajax is ready.
2746	
2747	DIOMEDES	This shall I undertake; and 'tis a burden
2748	Which I am proud to bear.
2749	
2750	[Exeunt DIOMEDES and CALCHAS]
2751	
2752	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS, before their tent]
2753	
2754	ULYSSES	Achilles stands i' the entrance of his tent:
2755	Please it our general to pass strangely by him,
2756	As if he were forgot; and, princes all,
2757	Lay negligent and loose regard upon him:
2758	I will come last. 'Tis like he'll question me
2759	Why such unplausive eyes are bent on him:
2760	If so, I have derision medicinable,
2761	To use between your strangeness and his pride,
2762	Which his own will shall have desire to drink:
2763	It may be good: pride hath no other glass
2764	To show itself but pride, for supple knees
2765	Feed arrogance and are the proud man's fees.
2766	
2767	AGAMEMNON	We'll execute your purpose, and put on
2768	A form of strangeness as we pass along:
2769	So do each lord, and either greet him not,
2770	Or else disdainfully, which shall shake him more
2771	Than if not look'd on. I will lead the way.
2772	
2773	ACHILLES	What, comes the general to speak with me?
2774	You know my mind, I'll fight no more 'gainst Troy.
2775	
2776	AGAMEMNON	What says Achilles? would he aught with us?
2777	
2778	NESTOR	Would you, my lord, aught with the general?
2779	
2780	ACHILLES	No.
2781	
2782	NESTOR	Nothing, my lord.
2783	
2784	AGAMEMNON	The better.
2785	
2786	[Exeunt AGAMEMNON and NESTOR]
2787	
2788	ACHILLES	Good day, good day.
2789	
2790	MENELAUS	How do you? how do you?
2791	
2792	[Exit]
2793	
2794	ACHILLES	What, does the cuckold scorn me?
2795	
2796	AJAX	How now, Patroclus!
2797	
2798	ACHILLES	Good morrow, Ajax.
2799	
2800	AJAX	Ha?
2801	
2802	ACHILLES	Good morrow.
2803	
2804	AJAX	Ay, and good next day too.
2805	
2806	[Exit]
2807	
2808	ACHILLES	What mean these fellows? Know they not Achilles?
2809	
2810	PATROCLUS	They pass by strangely: they were used to bend
2811	To send their smiles before them to Achilles;
2812	To come as humbly as they used to creep
2813	To holy altars.
2814	
2815	ACHILLES	                  What, am I poor of late?
2816	'Tis certain, greatness, once fall'n out with fortune,
2817	Must fall out with men too: what the declined is
2818	He shall as soon read in the eyes of others
2819	As feel in his own fall; for men, like butterflies,
2820	Show not their mealy wings but to the summer,
2821	And not a man, for being simply man,
2822	Hath any honour, but honour for those honours
2823	That are without him, as place, riches, favour,
2824	Prizes of accident as oft as merit:
2825	Which when they fall, as being slippery standers,
2826	The love that lean'd on them as slippery too,
2827	Do one pluck down another and together
2828	Die in the fall. But 'tis not so with me:
2829	Fortune and I are friends: I do enjoy
2830	At ample point all that I did possess,
2831	Save these men's looks; who do, methinks, find out
2832	Something not worth in me such rich beholding
2833	As they have often given. Here is Ulysses;
2834	I'll interrupt his reading.
2835	How now Ulysses!
2836	
2837	ULYSSES	                  Now, great Thetis' son!
2838	
2839	ACHILLES	What are you reading?
2840	
2841	ULYSSES	A strange fellow here
2842	Writes me: 'That man, how dearly ever parted,
2843	How much in having, or without or in,
2844	Cannot make boast to have that which he hath,
2845	Nor feels not what he owes, but by reflection;
2846	As when his virtues shining upon others
2847	Heat them and they retort that heat again
2848	To the first giver.'
2849	
2850	ACHILLES	This is not strange, Ulysses.
2851	The beauty that is borne here in the face
2852	The bearer knows not, but commends itself
2853	To others' eyes; nor doth the eye itself,
2854	That most pure spirit of sense, behold itself,
2855	Not going from itself; but eye to eye opposed
2856	Salutes each other with each other's form;
2857	For speculation turns not to itself,
2858	Till it hath travell'd and is mirror'd there
2859	Where it may see itself. This is not strange at all.
2860	
2861	ULYSSES	I do not strain at the position,--
2862	It is familiar,--but at the author's drift;
2863	Who, in his circumstance, expressly proves
2864	That no man is the lord of any thing,
2865	Though in and of him there be much consisting,
2866	Till he communicate his parts to others:
2867	Nor doth he of himself know them for aught
2868	Till he behold them form'd in the applause
2869	Where they're extended; who, like an arch,
2870	reverberates
2871	The voice again, or, like a gate of steel
2872	Fronting the sun, receives and renders back
2873	His figure and his heat.  I was much wrapt in this;
2874	And apprehended here immediately
2875	The unknown Ajax.
2876	Heavens, what a man is there! a very horse,
2877	That has he knows not what. Nature, what things there are
2878	Most abject in regard and dear in use!
2879	What things again most dear in the esteem
2880	And poor in worth! Now shall we see to-morrow--
2881	An act that very chance doth throw upon him--
2882	Ajax renown'd. O heavens, what some men do,
2883	While some men leave to do!
2884	How some men creep in skittish fortune's hall,
2885	Whiles others play the idiots in her eyes!
2886	How one man eats into another's pride,
2887	While pride is fasting in his wantonness!
2888	To see these Grecian lords!--why, even already
2889	They clap the lubber Ajax on the shoulder,
2890	As if his foot were on brave Hector's breast
2891	And great Troy shrieking.
2892	
2893	ACHILLES	I do believe it; for they pass'd by me
2894	As misers do by beggars, neither gave to me
2895	Good word nor look: what, are my deeds forgot?
2896	
2897	ULYSSES	Time hath, my lord, a wallet at his back,
2898	Wherein he puts alms for oblivion,
2899	A great-sized monster of ingratitudes:
2900	Those scraps are good deeds past; which are devour'd
2901	As fast as they are made, forgot as soon
2902	As done: perseverance, dear my lord,
2903	Keeps honour bright: to have done is to hang
2904	Quite out of fashion, like a rusty mail
2905	In monumental mockery. Take the instant way;
2906	For honour travels in a strait so narrow,
2907	Where one but goes abreast: keep then the path;
2908	For emulation hath a thousand sons
2909	That one by one pursue: if you give way,
2910	Or hedge aside from the direct forthright,
2911	Like to an enter'd tide, they all rush by
2912	And leave you hindmost;
2913	Or like a gallant horse fall'n in first rank,
2914	Lie there for pavement to the abject rear,
2915	O'er-run and trampled on: then what they do in present,
2916	Though less than yours in past, must o'ertop yours;
2917	For time is like a fashionable host
2918	That slightly shakes his parting guest by the hand,
2919	And with his arms outstretch'd, as he would fly,
2920	Grasps in the comer: welcome ever smiles,
2921	And farewell goes out sighing. O, let not
2922	virtue seek
2923	Remuneration for the thing it was;
2924	For beauty, wit,
2925	High birth, vigour of bone, desert in service,
2926	Love, friendship, charity, are subjects all
2927	To envious and calumniating time.
2928	One touch of nature makes the whole world kin,
2929	That all with one consent praise new-born gawds,
2930	Though they are made and moulded of things past,
2931	And give to dust that is a little gilt
2932	More laud than gilt o'er-dusted.
2933	The present eye praises the present object.
2934	Then marvel not, thou great and complete man,
2935	That all the Greeks begin to worship Ajax;
2936	Since things in motion sooner catch the eye
2937	Than what not stirs. The cry went once on thee,
2938	And still it might, and yet it may again,
2939	If thou wouldst not entomb thyself alive
2940	And case thy reputation in thy tent;
2941	Whose glorious deeds, but in these fields of late,
2942	Made emulous missions 'mongst the gods themselves
2943	And drave great Mars to faction.
2944	
2945	ACHILLES	Of this my privacy
2946	I have strong reasons.
2947	
2948	ULYSSES	But 'gainst your privacy
2949	The reasons are more potent and heroical:
2950	'Tis known, Achilles, that you are in love
2951	With one of Priam's daughters.
2952	
2953	ACHILLES	Ha! known!
2954	
2955	ULYSSES	Is that a wonder?
2956	The providence that's in a watchful state
2957	Knows almost every grain of Plutus' gold,
2958	Finds bottom in the uncomprehensive deeps,
2959	Keeps place with thought and almost, like the gods,
2960	Does thoughts unveil in their dumb cradles.
2961	There is a mystery--with whom relation
2962	Durst never meddle--in the soul of state;
2963	Which hath an operation more divine
2964	Than breath or pen can give expressure to:
2965	All the commerce that you have had with Troy
2966	As perfectly is ours as yours, my lord;
2967	And better would it fit Achilles much
2968	To throw down Hector than Polyxena:
2969	But it must grieve young Pyrrhus now at home,
2970	When fame shall in our islands sound her trump,
2971	And all the Greekish girls shall tripping sing,
2972	'Great Hector's sister did Achilles win,
2973	But our great Ajax bravely beat down him.'
2974	Farewell, my lord: I as your lover speak;
2975	The fool slides o'er the ice that you should break.
2976	
2977	[Exit]
2978	
2979	PATROCLUS	To this effect, Achilles, have I moved you:
2980	A woman impudent and mannish grown
2981	Is not more loathed than an effeminate man
2982	In time of action. I stand condemn'd for this;
2983	They think my little stomach to the war
2984	And your great love to me restrains you thus:
2985	Sweet, rouse yourself; and the weak wanton Cupid
2986	Shall from your neck unloose his amorous fold,
2987	And, like a dew-drop from the lion's mane,
2988	Be shook to air.
2989	
2990	ACHILLES	                  Shall Ajax fight with Hector?
2991	
2992	PATROCLUS	Ay, and perhaps receive much honour by him.
2993	
2994	ACHILLES	I see my reputation is at stake
2995	My fame is shrewdly gored.
2996	
2997	PATROCLUS	O, then, beware;
2998	Those wounds heal ill that men do give themselves:
2999	Omission to do what is necessary
3000	Seals a commission to a blank of danger;
3001	And danger, like an ague, subtly taints
3002	Even then when we sit idly in the sun.
3003	
3004	ACHILLES	Go call Thersites hither, sweet Patroclus:
3005	I'll send the fool to Ajax and desire him
3006	To invite the Trojan lords after the combat
3007	To see us here unarm'd: I have a woman's longing,
3008	An appetite that I am sick withal,
3009	To see great Hector in his weeds of peace,
3010	To talk with him and to behold his visage,
3011	Even to my full of view.
3012	
3013	[Enter THERSITES]
3014	
3015	A labour saved!
3016	
3017	THERSITES	A wonder!
3018	
3019	ACHILLES	What?
3020	
3021	THERSITES	Ajax goes up and down the field, asking for himself.
3022	
3023	ACHILLES	How so?
3024	
3025	THERSITES	He must fight singly to-morrow with Hector, and is so
3026	prophetically proud of an heroical cudgelling that he
3027	raves in saying nothing.
3028	
3029	ACHILLES	How can that be?
3030	
3031	THERSITES	Why, he stalks up and down like a peacock,--a stride
3032	and a stand: ruminates like an hostess that hath no
3033	arithmetic but her brain to set down her reckoning:
3034	bites his lip with a politic regard, as who should
3035	say 'There were wit in this head, an 'twould out;'
3036	and so there is, but it lies as coldly in him as fire
3037	in a flint, which will not show without knocking.
3038	The man's undone forever; for if Hector break not his
3039	neck i' the combat, he'll break 't himself in
3040	vain-glory. He knows not me: I said 'Good morrow,
3041	Ajax;' and he replies 'Thanks, Agamemnon.' What think
3042	you of this man that takes me for the general? He's
3043	grown a very land-fish, language-less, a monster.
3044	A plague of opinion! a man may wear it on both
3045	sides, like a leather jerkin.
3046	
3047	ACHILLES	Thou must be my ambassador to him, Thersites.
3048	
3049	THERSITES	Who, I? why, he'll answer nobody; he professes not
3050	answering: speaking is for beggars; he wears his
3051	tongue in's arms. I will put on his presence: let
3052	Patroclus make demands to me, you shall see the
3053	pageant of Ajax.
3054	
3055	ACHILLES	To him, Patroclus; tell him I humbly desire the
3056	valiant Ajax to invite the most valorous Hector
3057	to come unarmed to my tent, and to procure
3058	safe-conduct for his person of the magnanimous
3059	and most illustrious six-or-seven-times-honoured
3060	captain-general of the Grecian army, Agamemnon,
3061	et cetera. Do this.
3062	
3063	PATROCLUS	Jove bless great Ajax!
3064	
3065	THERSITES	Hum!
3066	
3067	PATROCLUS	I come from the worthy Achilles,--
3068	
3069	THERSITES	Ha!
3070	
3071	PATROCLUS	Who most humbly desires you to invite Hector to his tent,--
3072	
3073	THERSITES	Hum!
3074	
3075	PATROCLUS	And to procure safe-conduct from Agamemnon.
3076	
3077	THERSITES	Agamemnon!
3078	
3079	PATROCLUS	Ay, my lord.
3080	
3081	THERSITES	Ha!
3082	
3083	PATROCLUS	What say you to't?
3084	
3085	THERSITES	God b' wi' you, with all my heart.
3086	
3087	PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.
3088	
3089	THERSITES	If to-morrow be a fair day, by eleven o'clock it will
3090	go one way or other: howsoever, he shall pay for me
3091	ere he has me.
3092	
3093	PATROCLUS	Your answer, sir.
3094	
3095	THERSITES	Fare you well, with all my heart.
3096	
3097	ACHILLES	Why, but he is not in this tune, is he?
3098	
3099	THERSITES	No, but he's out o' tune thus. What music will be in
3100	him when Hector has knocked out his brains, I know
3101	not; but, I am sure, none, unless the fiddler Apollo
3102	get his sinews to make catlings on.
3103	
3104	ACHILLES	Come, thou shalt bear a letter to him straight.
3105	
3106	THERSITES	Let me bear another to his horse; for that's the more
3107	capable creature.
3108	
3109	ACHILLES	My mind is troubled, like a fountain stirr'd;
3110	And I myself see not the bottom of it.
3111	
3112	[Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]
3113	
3114	THERSITES	Would the fountain of your mind were clear again,
3115	that I might water an ass at it! I had rather be a
3116	tick in a sheep than such a valiant ignorance.
3117	
3118	[Exit]

3124	
3125	
3126	ACT IV
3127	
3128	
3129	
3130	SCENE I	Troy. A street.
3131	
3132	
3133	[Enter, from one side, AENEAS, and Servant with a
3134	torch; from the other, PARIS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR,
3135	DIOMEDES, and others, with torches]
3136	
3137	PARIS	See, ho! who is that there?
3138	
3139	DEIPHOBUS	It is the Lord AEneas.
3140	
3141	AENEAS	Is the prince there in person?
3142	Had I so good occasion to lie long
3143	As you, prince Paris, nothing but heavenly business
3144	Should rob my bed-mate of my company.
3145	
3146	DIOMEDES	That's my mind too. Good morrow, Lord AEneas.
3147	
3148	PARIS	A valiant Greek, AEneas,--take his hand,--
3149	Witness the process of your speech, wherein
3150	You told how Diomed, a whole week by days,
3151	Did haunt you in the field.
3152	
3153	AENEAS	Health to you, valiant sir,
3154	During all question of the gentle truce;
3155	But when I meet you arm'd, as black defiance
3156	As heart can think or courage execute.
3157	
3158	DIOMEDES	The one and other Diomed embraces.
3159	Our bloods are now in calm; and, so long, health!
3160	But when contention and occasion meet,
3161	By Jove, I'll play the hunter for thy life
3162	With all my force, pursuit and policy.
3163	
3164	AENEAS	And thou shalt hunt a lion, that will fly
3165	With his face backward. In humane gentleness,
3166	Welcome to Troy! now, by Anchises' life,
3167	Welcome, indeed! By Venus' hand I swear,
3168	No man alive can love in such a sort
3169	The thing he means to kill more excellently.
3170	
3171	DIOMEDES	We sympathize: Jove, let AEneas live,
3172	If to my sword his fate be not the glory,
3173	A thousand complete courses of the sun!
3174	But, in mine emulous honour, let him die,
3175	With every joint a wound, and that to-morrow!
3176	
3177	AENEAS	We know each other well.
3178	
3179	DIOMEDES	We do; and long to know each other worse.
3180	
3181	PARIS	This is the most despiteful gentle greeting,
3182	The noblest hateful love, that e'er I heard of.
3183	What business, lord, so early?
3184	
3185	AENEAS	I was sent for to the king; but why, I know not.
3186	
3187	PARIS	His purpose meets you: 'twas to bring this Greek
3188	To Calchas' house, and there to render him,
3189	For the enfreed Antenor, the fair Cressid:
3190	Let's have your company, or, if you please,
3191	Haste there before us: I constantly do think--
3192	Or rather, call my thought a certain knowledge--
3193	My brother Troilus lodges there to-night:
3194	Rouse him and give him note of our approach.
3195	With the whole quality wherefore: I fear
3196	We shall be much unwelcome.
3197	
3198	AENEAS	That I assure you:
3199	Troilus had rather Troy were borne to Greece
3200	Than Cressid borne from Troy.
3201	
3202	PARIS	There is no help;
3203	The bitter disposition of the time
3204	Will have it so. On, lord; we'll follow you.
3205	
3206	AENEAS	Good morrow, all.
3207	
3208	[Exit with Servant]
3209	
3210	PARIS	And tell me, noble Diomed, faith, tell me true,
3211	Even in the soul of sound good-fellowship,
3212	Who, in your thoughts, merits fair Helen best,
3213	Myself or Menelaus?
3214	
3215	DIOMEDES	Both alike:
3216	He merits well to have her, that doth seek her,
3217	Not making any scruple of her soilure,
3218	With such a hell of pain and world of charge,
3219	And you as well to keep her, that defend her,
3220	Not palating the taste of her dishonour,
3221	With such a costly loss of wealth and friends:
3222	He, like a puling cuckold, would drink up
3223	The lees and dregs of a flat tamed piece;
3224	You, like a lecher, out of whorish loins
3225	Are pleased to breed out your inheritors:
3226	Both merits poised, each weighs nor less nor more;
3227	But he as he, the heavier for a whore.
3228	
3229	PARIS	You are too bitter to your countrywoman.
3230	
3231	DIOMEDES	She's bitter to her country: hear me, Paris:
3232	For every false drop in her bawdy veins
3233	A Grecian's life hath sunk; for every scruple
3234	Of her contaminated carrion weight,
3235	A Trojan hath been slain: since she could speak,
3236	She hath not given so many good words breath
3237	As for her Greeks and Trojans suffer'd death.
3238	
3239	PARIS	Fair Diomed, you do as chapmen do,
3240	Dispraise the thing that you desire to buy:
3241	But we in silence hold this virtue well,
3242	We'll but commend what we intend to sell.
3243	Here lies our way.

3257	SCENE II	The same. Court of Pandarus' house.
3258	
3259	
3260	[Enter TROILUS and CRESSIDA]
3261	
3262	TROILUS	Dear, trouble not yourself: the morn is cold.
3263	
3264	CRESSIDA	Then, sweet my lord, I'll call mine uncle down;
3265	He shall unbolt the gates.
3266	
3267	TROILUS	Trouble him not;
3268	To bed, to bed: sleep kill those pretty eyes,
3269	And give as soft attachment to thy senses
3270	As infants' empty of all thought!
3271	
3272	CRESSIDA	Good morrow, then.
3273	
3274	TROILUS	I prithee now, to bed.
3275	
3276	CRESSIDA	Are you a-weary of me?
3277	
3278	TROILUS	O Cressida! but that the busy day,
3279	Waked by the lark, hath roused the ribald crows,
3280	And dreaming night will hide our joys no longer,
3281	I would not from thee.
3282	
3283	CRESSIDA	Night hath been too brief.
3284	
3285	TROILUS	Beshrew the witch! with venomous wights she stays
3286	As tediously as hell, but flies the grasps of love
3287	With wings more momentary-swift than thought.
3288	You will catch cold, and curse me.
3289	
3290	CRESSIDA	Prithee, tarry:
3291	You men will never tarry.
3292	O foolish Cressid! I might have still held off,
3293	And then you would have tarried. Hark!
3294	there's one up.
3295	
3296	PANDARUS	[Within]  What, 's all the doors open here?
3297	
3298	TROILUS	It is your uncle.
3299	
3300	CRESSIDA	A pestilence on him! now will he be mocking:
3301	I shall have such a life!
3302	
3303	[Enter PANDARUS]
3304	
3305	PANDARUS	How now, how now! how go maidenheads? Here, you
3306	maid! where's my cousin Cressid?
3307	
3308	CRESSIDA	Go hang yourself, you naughty mocking uncle!
3309	You bring me to do, and then you flout me too.
3310	
3311	PANDARUS	To do what? to do what? let her say
3312	what: what have I brought you to do?
3313	
3314	CRESSIDA	Come, come, beshrew your heart! you'll ne'er be good,
3315	Nor suffer others.
3316	
3317	PANDARUS	Ha! ha! Alas, poor wretch! ah, poor capocchia!
3318	hast not slept to-night? would he not, a naughty
3319	man, let it sleep? a bugbear take him!
3320	
3321	CRESSIDA	Did not I tell you? Would he were knock'd i' the head!
3322	
3323	[Knocking within]
3324	
3325	Who's that at door? good uncle, go and see.
3326	My lord, come you again into my chamber:
3327	You smile and mock me, as if I meant naughtily.
3328	
3329	TROILUS	Ha, ha!
3330	
3331	CRESSIDA	Come, you are deceived, I think of no such thing.
3332	
3333	[Knocking within]
3334	
3335	How earnestly they knock! Pray you, come in:
3336	I would not for half Troy have you seen here.
3337	
3338	[Exeunt TROILUS and CRESSIDA]
3339	
3340	PANDARUS	Who's there? what's the matter? will you beat
3341	down the door? How now! what's the matter?
3342	
3343	[Enter AENEAS]
3344	
3345	AENEAS	Good morrow, lord, good morrow.
3346	
3347	PANDARUS	Who's there? my Lord AEneas! By my troth,
3348	I knew you not: what news with you so early?
3349	
3350	AENEAS	Is not Prince Troilus here?
3351	
3352	PANDARUS	Here! what should he do here?
3353	
3354	AENEAS	Come, he is here, my lord; do not deny him:
3355	It doth import him much to speak with me.
3356	
3357	PANDARUS	Is he here, say you? 'tis more than I know, I'll
3358	be sworn: for my own part, I came in late. What
3359	should he do here?
3360	
3361	AENEAS	Who!--nay, then: come, come, you'll do him wrong
3362	ere you're ware: you'll be so true to him, to be
3363	false to him: do not you know of him, but yet go
3364	fetch him hither; go.
3365	
3366	[Re-enter TROILUS]
3367	
3368	TROILUS	How now! what's the matter?
3369	
3370	AENEAS	My lord, I scarce have leisure to salute you,
3371	My matter is so rash: there is at hand
3372	Paris your brother, and Deiphobus,
3373	The Grecian Diomed, and our Antenor
3374	Deliver'd to us; and for him forthwith,
3375	Ere the first sacrifice, within this hour,
3376	We must give up to Diomedes' hand
3377	The Lady Cressida.
3378	
3379	TROILUS	                  Is it so concluded?
3380	
3381	AENEAS	By Priam and the general state of Troy:
3382	They are at hand and ready to effect it.
3383	
3384	TROILUS	How my achievements mock me!
3385	I will go meet them: and, my Lord AEneas,
3386	We met by chance; you did not find me here.
3387	
3388	AENEAS	Good, good, my lord; the secrets of nature
3389	Have not more gift in taciturnity.
3390	
3391	[Exeunt TROILUS and AENEAS]
3392	
3393	PANDARUS	Is't possible? no sooner got but lost? The devil
3394	take Antenor! the young prince will go mad: a
3395	plague upon Antenor! I would they had broke 's neck!
3396	
3397	[Re-enter CRESSIDA]
3398	
3399	CRESSIDA	How now! what's the matter? who was here?
3400	
3401	PANDARUS	Ah, ah!
3402	
3403	CRESSIDA	Why sigh you so profoundly? where's my lord? gone!
3404	Tell me, sweet uncle, what's the matter?
3405	
3406	PANDARUS	Would I were as deep under the earth as I am above!
3407	
3408	CRESSIDA	O the gods! what's the matter?
3409	
3410	PANDARUS	Prithee, get thee in: would thou hadst ne'er been
3411	born! I knew thou wouldst be his death. O, poor
3412	gentleman! A plague upon Antenor!
3413	
3414	CRESSIDA	Good uncle, I beseech you, on my knees! beseech you,
3415	what's the matter?
3416	
3417	PANDARUS	Thou must be gone, wench, thou must be gone; thou
3418	art changed for Antenor: thou must to thy father,
3419	and be gone from Troilus: 'twill be his death;
3420	'twill be his bane; he cannot bear it.
3421	
3422	CRESSIDA	O you immortal gods! I will not go.
3423	
3424	PANDARUS	Thou must.
3425	
3426	CRESSIDA	I will not, uncle: I have forgot my father;
3427	I know no touch of consanguinity;
3428	No kin no love, no blood, no soul so near me
3429	As the sweet Troilus. O you gods divine!
3430	Make Cressid's name the very crown of falsehood,
3431	If ever she leave Troilus! Time, force, and death,
3432	Do to this body what extremes you can;
3433	But the strong base and building of my love
3434	Is as the very centre of the earth,
3435	Drawing all things to it. I'll go in and weep,--
3436	
3437	PANDARUS	Do, do.
3438	
3439	CRESSIDA	Tear my bright hair and scratch my praised cheeks,
3440	Crack my clear voice with sobs and break my heart
3441	With sounding Troilus. I will not go from Troy.
3442

3458	[Enter PARIS, TROILUS, AENEAS, DEIPHOBUS, ANTENOR,
3459	and DIOMEDES]
3460	
3461	PARIS	It is great morning, and the hour prefix'd
3462	Of her delivery to this valiant Greek
3463	Comes fast upon. Good my brother Troilus,
3464	Tell you the lady what she is to do,
3465	And haste her to the purpose.
3466	
3467	TROILUS	Walk into her house;
3468	I'll bring her to the Grecian presently:
3469	And to his hand when I deliver her,
3470	Think it an altar, and thy brother Troilus
3471	A priest there offering to it his own heart.
3472	
3473	[Exit]
3474	
3475	PARIS	I know what 'tis to love;
3476	And would, as I shall pity, I could help!
3477	Please you walk in, my lords.

3492	
3493	
3494	[Enter PANDARUS and CRESSIDA]
3495	
3496	PANDARUS	Be moderate, be moderate.
3497	
3498	CRESSIDA	Why tell you me of moderation?
3499	The grief is fine, full, perfect, that I taste,
3500	And violenteth in a sense as strong
3501	As that which causeth it: how can I moderate it?
3502	If I could temporize with my affection,
3503	Or brew it to a weak and colder palate,
3504	The like allayment could I give my grief.
3505	My love admits no qualifying dross;
3506	No more my grief, in such a precious loss.
3507	
3508	PANDARUS	Here, here, here he comes.
3509	
3510	[Enter TROILUS]
3511	
3512	Ah, sweet ducks!
3513	
3514	CRESSIDA	O Troilus! Troilus!
3515	
3516	[Embracing him]
3517	
3518	PANDARUS	What a pair of spectacles is here!
3519	Let me embrace too. 'O heart,' as the goodly saying is,
3520	'--O heart, heavy heart,
3521	Why sigh'st thou without breaking?
3522	where he answers again,
3523	'Because thou canst not ease thy smart
3524	By friendship nor by speaking.'
3525	There was never a truer rhyme. Let us cast away
3526	nothing, for we may live to have need of such a
3527	verse: we see it, we see it. How now, lambs?
3528	
3529	TROILUS	Cressid, I love thee in so strain'd a purity,
3530	That the bless'd gods, as angry with my fancy,
3531	More bright in zeal than the devotion which
3532	Cold lips blow to their deities, take thee from me.
3533	
3534	CRESSIDA	Have the gods envy?
3535	
3536	PANDARUS	Ay, ay, ay, ay; 'tis too plain a case.
3537	
3538	CRESSIDA	And is it true that I must go from Troy?
3539	
3540	TROILUS	A hateful truth.
3541	
3542	CRESSIDA	                  What, and from Troilus too?
3543	
3544	TROILUS	From Troy and Troilus.
3545	
3546	CRESSIDA	Is it possible?
3547	
3548	TROILUS	And suddenly; where injury of chance
3549	Puts back leave-taking, justles roughly by
3550	All time of pause, rudely beguiles our lips
3551	Of all rejoindure, forcibly prevents
3552	Our lock'd embrasures, strangles our dear vows
3553	Even in the birth of our own labouring breath:
3554	We two, that with so many thousand sighs
3555	Did buy each other, must poorly sell ourselves
3556	With the rude brevity and discharge of one.
3557	Injurious time now with a robber's haste
3558	Crams his rich thievery up, he knows not how:
3559	As many farewells as be stars in heaven,
3560	With distinct breath and consign'd kisses to them,
3561	He fumbles up into a lose adieu,
3562	And scants us with a single famish'd kiss,
3563	Distasted with the salt of broken tears.
3564	
3565	AENEAS	[Within]  My lord, is the lady ready?
3566	
3567	TROILUS	Hark! you are call'd: some say the Genius so
3568	Cries 'come' to him that instantly must die.
3569	Bid them have patience; she shall come anon.
3570	
3571	PANDARUS	Where are my tears? rain, to lay this wind, or
3572	my heart will be blown up by the root.
3573	
3574	[Exit]
3575	
3576	CRESSIDA	I must then to the Grecians?
3577	
3578	TROILUS	No remedy.
3579	
3580	CRESSIDA	A woful Cressid 'mongst the merry Greeks!
3581	When shall we see again?
3582	
3583	TROILUS	Hear me, my love: be thou but true of heart,--
3584	
3585	CRESSIDA	I true! how now! what wicked deem is this?
3586	
3587	TROILUS	Nay, we must use expostulation kindly,
3588	For it is parting from us:
3589	I speak not 'be thou true,' as fearing thee,
3590	For I will throw my glove to Death himself,
3591	That there's no maculation in thy heart:
3592	But 'be thou true,' say I, to fashion in
3593	My sequent protestation; be thou true,
3594	And I will see thee.
3595	
3596	CRESSIDA	O, you shall be exposed, my lord, to dangers
3597	As infinite as imminent! but I'll be true.
3598	
3599	TROILUS	And I'll grow friend with danger. Wear this sleeve.
3600	
3601	CRESSIDA	And you this glove. When shall I see you?
3602	
3603	TROILUS	I will corrupt the Grecian sentinels,
3604	To give thee nightly visitation.
3605	But yet be true.
3606	
3607	CRESSIDA	                  O heavens! 'be true' again!
3608	
3609	TROILUS	Hear while I speak it, love:
3610	The Grecian youths are full of quality;
3611	They're loving, well composed with gifts of nature,
3612	Flowing and swelling o'er with arts and exercise:
3613	How novelty may move, and parts with person,
3614	Alas, a kind of godly jealousy--
3615	Which, I beseech you, call a virtuous sin--
3616	Makes me afeard.
3617	
3618	CRESSIDA	                  O heavens! you love me not.
3619	
3620	TROILUS	Die I a villain, then!
3621	In this I do not call your faith in question
3622	So mainly as my merit: I cannot sing,
3623	Nor heel the high lavolt, nor sweeten talk,
3624	Nor play at subtle games; fair virtues all,
3625	To which the Grecians are most prompt and pregnant:
3626	But I can tell that in each grace of these
3627	There lurks a still and dumb-discoursive devil
3628	That tempts most cunningly: but be not tempted.
3629	
3630	CRESSIDA	Do you think I will?
3631	
3632	TROILUS	No.
3633	But something may be done that we will not:
3634	And sometimes we are devils to ourselves,
3635	When we will tempt the frailty of our powers,
3636	Presuming on their changeful potency.
3637	
3638	AENEAS	[Within]  Nay, good my lord,--
3639	
3640	TROILUS	Come, kiss; and let us part.
3641	
3642	PARIS	[Within]  Brother Troilus!
3643	
3644	TROILUS	Good brother, come you hither;
3645	And bring AEneas and the Grecian with you.
3646	
3647	CRESSIDA	My lord, will you be true?
3648	
3649	TROILUS	Who, I? alas, it is my vice, my fault:
3650	Whiles others fish with craft for great opinion,
3651	I with great truth catch mere simplicity;
3652	Whilst some with cunning gild their copper crowns,
3653	With truth and plainness I do wear mine bare.
3654	Fear not my truth: the moral of my wit
3655	Is 'plain and true;' there's all the reach of it.
3656	
3657	[Enter AENEAS, PARIS, ANTENOR, DEIPHOBUS,
3658	and DIOMEDES]
3659	
3660	Welcome, Sir Diomed! here is the lady
3661	Which for Antenor we deliver you:
3662	At the port, lord, I'll give her to thy hand,
3663	And by the way possess thee what she is.
3664	Entreat her fair; and, by my soul, fair Greek,
3665	If e'er thou stand at mercy of my sword,
3666	Name Cressida and thy life shall be as safe
3667	As Priam is in Ilion.
3668	
3669	DIOMEDES	Fair Lady Cressid,
3670	So please you, save the thanks this prince expects:
3671	The lustre in your eye, heaven in your cheek,
3672	Pleads your fair usage; and to Diomed
3673	You shall be mistress, and command him wholly.
3674	
3675	TROILUS	Grecian, thou dost not use me courteously,
3676	To shame the zeal of my petition to thee
3677	In praising her: I tell thee, lord of Greece,
3678	She is as far high-soaring o'er thy praises
3679	As thou unworthy to be call'd her servant.
3680	I charge thee use her well, even for my charge;
3681	For, by the dreadful Pluto, if thou dost not,
3682	Though the great bulk Achilles be thy guard,
3683	I'll cut thy throat.
3684	
3685	DIOMEDES	O, be not moved, Prince Troilus:
3686	Let me be privileged by my place and message,
3687	To be a speaker free; when I am hence
3688	I'll answer to my lust: and know you, lord,
3689	I'll nothing do on charge: to her own worth
3690	She shall be prized; but that you say 'be't so,'
3691	I'll speak it in my spirit and honour, 'no.'
3692	
3693	TROILUS	Come, to the port. I'll tell thee, Diomed,
3694	This brave shall oft make thee to hide thy head.
3695	Lady, give me your hand, and, as we walk,
3696	To our own selves bend we our needful talk.
3697	
3698	[Exeunt TROILUS, CRESSIDA, and DIOMEDES]
3699	
3700	[Trumpet within]
3701	
3702	PARIS	Hark! Hector's trumpet.
3703	
3704	AENEAS	How have we spent this morning!
3705	The prince must think me tardy and remiss,
3706	That sore to ride before him to the field.
3707	
3708	PARIS	'Tis Troilus' fault: come, come, to field with him.
3709	
3710	DEIPHOBUS	Let us make ready straight.
3711	
3712	AENEAS	Yea, with a bridegroom's fresh alacrity,
3713	Let us address to tend on Hector's heels:
3714	The glory of our Troy doth this day lie
3715	On his fair worth and single chivalry.
3716	
3717	[Exeunt]
3718	
3719	
3720	
3721	
3722	TROILUS AND CRESSIDA
3723	
3724	
3725	ACT IV
3726	
3727	
3728	
3729	SCENE V	The Grecian camp. Lists set out.
3730	
3731	
3732	[Enter AJAX, armed; AGAMEMNON, ACHILLES, PATROCLUS,
3733	MENELAUS, ULYSSES, NESTOR, and others]
3734	
3735	AGAMEMNON	Here art thou in appointment fresh and fair,
3736	Anticipating time with starting courage.
3737	Give with thy trumpet a loud note to Troy,
3738	Thou dreadful Ajax; that the appalled air
3739	May pierce the head of the great combatant
3740	And hale him hither.
3741	
3742	AJAX	Thou, trumpet, there's my purse.
3743	Now crack thy lungs, and split thy brazen pipe:
3744	Blow, villain, till thy sphered bias cheek
3745	Outswell the colic of puff'd Aquilon:
3746	Come, stretch thy chest and let thy eyes spout blood;
3747	Thou blow'st for Hector.
3748	
3749	[Trumpet sounds]
3750	
3751	ULYSSES	No trumpet answers.
3752	
3753	ACHILLES	'Tis but early days.
3754	
3755	AGAMEMNON	Is not yond Diomed, with Calchas' daughter?
3756	
3757	ULYSSES	'Tis he, I ken the manner of his gait;
3758	He rises on the toe: that spirit of his
3759	In aspiration lifts him from the earth.
3760	
3761	[Enter DIOMEDES, with CRESSIDA]
3762	
3763	AGAMEMNON	Is this the Lady Cressid?
3764	
3765	DIOMEDES	Even she.
3766	
3767	AGAMEMNON	Most dearly welcome to the Greeks, sweet lady.
3768	
3769	NESTOR	Our general doth salute you with a kiss.
3770	
3771	ULYSSES	Yet is the kindness but particular;
3772	'Twere better she were kiss'd in general.
3773	
3774	NESTOR	And very courtly counsel: I'll begin.
3775	So much for Nestor.
3776	
3777	ACHILLES	I'll take what winter from your lips, fair lady:
3778	Achilles bids you welcome.
3779	
3780	MENELAUS	I had good argument for kissing once.
3781	
3782	PATROCLUS	But that's no argument for kissing now;
3783	For this popp'd Paris in his hardiment,
3784	And parted thus you and your argument.
3785	
3786	ULYSSES	O deadly gall, and theme of all our scorns!
3787	For which we lose our heads to gild his horns.
3788	
3789	PATROCLUS	The first was Menelaus' kiss; this, mine:
3790	Patroclus kisses you.
3791	
3792	MENELAUS	O, this is trim!
3793	
3794	PATROCLUS	Paris and I kiss evermore for him.
3795	
3796	MENELAUS	I'll have my kiss, sir. Lady, by your leave.
3797	
3798	CRESSIDA	In kissing, do you render or receive?
3799	
3800	PATROCLUS	Both take and give.
3801	
3802	CRESSIDA	I'll make my match to live,
3803	The kiss you take is better than you give;
3804	Therefore no kiss.
3805	
3806	MENELAUS	I'll give you boot, I'll give you three for one.
3807	
3808	CRESSIDA	You're an odd man; give even or give none.
3809	
3810	MENELAUS	An odd man, lady! every man is odd.
3811	
3812	CRESSIDA	No, Paris is not; for you know 'tis true,
3813	That you are odd, and he is even with you.
3814	
3815	MENELAUS	You fillip me o' the head.
3816	
3817	CRESSIDA	No, I'll be sworn.
3818	
3819	ULYSSES	It were no match, your nail against his horn.
3820	May I, sweet lady, beg a kiss of you?
3821	
3822	CRESSIDA	You may.
3823	
3824	ULYSSES	       I do desire it.
3825	
3826	CRESSIDA	Why, beg, then.
3827	
3828	ULYSSES	Why then for Venus' sake, give me a kiss,
3829	When Helen is a maid again, and his.
3830	
3831	CRESSIDA	I am your debtor, claim it when 'tis due.
3832	
3833	ULYSSES	Never's my day, and then a kiss of you.
3834	
3835	DIOMEDES	Lady, a word: I'll bring you to your father.
3836	
3837	[Exit with CRESSIDA]
3838	
3839	NESTOR	A woman of quick sense.
3840	
3841	ULYSSES	Fie, fie upon her!
3842	There's language in her eye, her cheek, her lip,
3843	Nay, her foot speaks; her wanton spirits look out
3844	At every joint and motive of her body.
3845	O, these encounterers, so glib of tongue,
3846	That give accosting welcome ere it comes,
3847	And wide unclasp the tables of their thoughts
3848	To every ticklish reader! set them down
3849	For sluttish spoils of opportunity
3850	And daughters of the game.
3851	
3852	[Trumpet within]
3853	
3854	ALL	The Trojans' trumpet.
3855	
3856	AGAMEMNON	Yonder comes the troop.
3857	
3858	[Enter HECTOR, armed; AENEAS, TROILUS, and other
3859	Trojans, with Attendants]
3860	
3861	AENEAS	Hail, all you state of Greece! what shall be done
3862	To him that victory commands? or do you purpose
3863	A victor shall be known? will you the knights
3864	Shall to the edge of all extremity
3865	Pursue each other, or shall be divided
3866	By any voice or order of the field?
3867	Hector bade ask.
3868	
3869	AGAMEMNON	Which way would Hector have it?
3870	
3871	AENEAS	He cares not; he'll obey conditions.
3872	
3873	ACHILLES	'Tis done like Hector; but securely done,
3874	A little proudly, and great deal misprizing
3875	The knight opposed.
3876	
3877	AENEAS	If not Achilles, sir,
3878	What is your name?
3879	
3880	ACHILLES	                  If not Achilles, nothing.
3881	
3882	AENEAS	Therefore Achilles: but, whate'er, know this:
3883	In the extremity of great and little,
3884	Valour and pride excel themselves in Hector;
3885	The one almost as infinite as all,
3886	The other blank as nothing. Weigh him well,
3887	And that which looks like pride is courtesy.
3888	This Ajax is half made of Hector's blood:
3889	In love whereof, half Hector stays at home;
3890	Half heart, half hand, half Hector comes to seek
3891	This blended knight, half Trojan and half Greek.
3892	
3893	ACHILLES	A maiden battle, then? O, I perceive you.
3894	
3895	[Re-enter DIOMEDES]
3896	
3897	AGAMEMNON	Here is Sir Diomed. Go, gentle knight,
3898	Stand by our Ajax: as you and Lord AEneas
3899	Consent upon the order of their fight,
3900	So be it; either to the uttermost,
3901	Or else a breath: the combatants being kin
3902	Half stints their strife before their strokes begin.
3903	
3904	[AJAX and HECTOR enter the lists]
3905	
3906	ULYSSES	They are opposed already.
3907	
3908	AGAMEMNON	What Trojan is that same that looks so heavy?
3909	
3910	ULYSSES	The youngest son of Priam, a true knight,
3911	Not yet mature, yet matchless, firm of word,
3912	Speaking in deeds and deedless in his tongue;
3913	Not soon provoked nor being provoked soon calm'd:
3914	His heart and hand both open and both free;
3915	For what he has he gives, what thinks he shows;
3916	Yet gives he not till judgment guide his bounty,
3917	Nor dignifies an impure thought with breath;
3918	Manly as Hector, but more dangerous;
3919	For Hector in his blaze of wrath subscribes
3920	To tender objects, but he in heat of action
3921	Is more vindicative than jealous love:
3922	They call him Troilus, and on him erect
3923	A second hope, as fairly built as Hector.
3924	Thus says AEneas; one that knows the youth
3925	Even to his inches, and with private soul
3926	Did in great Ilion thus translate him to me.
3927	
3928	[Alarum. Hector and Ajax fight]
3929	
3930	AGAMEMNON	They are in action.
3931	
3932	NESTOR	Now, Ajax, hold thine own!
3933	
3934	TROILUS	Hector, thou sleep'st;
3935	Awake thee!
3936	
3937	AGAMEMNON	His blows are well disposed: there, Ajax!
3938	
3939	DIOMEDES	You must no more.
3940	
3941	[Trumpets cease]
3942	
3943	AENEAS	                  Princes, enough, so please you.
3944	
3945	AJAX	I am not warm yet; let us fight again.
3946	
3947	DIOMEDES	As Hector pleases.
3948	
3949	HECTOR	                  Why, then will I no more:
3950	Thou art, great lord, my father's sister's son,
3951	A cousin-german to great Priam's seed;
3952	The obligation of our blood forbids
3953	A gory emulation 'twixt us twain:
3954	Were thy commixtion Greek and Trojan so
3955	That thou couldst say 'This hand is Grecian all,
3956	And this is Trojan; the sinews of this leg
3957	All Greek, and this all Troy; my mother's blood
3958	Runs on the dexter cheek, and this sinister
3959	Bounds in my father's;' by Jove multipotent,
3960	Thou shouldst not bear from me a Greekish member
3961	Wherein my sword had not impressure made
3962	Of our rank feud: but the just gods gainsay
3963	That any drop thou borrow'dst from thy mother,
3964	My sacred aunt, should by my mortal sword
3965	Be drain'd! Let me embrace thee, Ajax:
3966	By him that thunders, thou hast lusty arms;
3967	Hector would have them fall upon him thus:
3968	Cousin, all honour to thee!
3969	
3970	AJAX	I thank thee, Hector
3971	Thou art too gentle and too free a man:
3972	I came to kill thee, cousin, and bear hence
3973	A great addition earned in thy death.
3974	
3975	HECTOR	Not Neoptolemus so mirable,
3976	On whose bright crest Fame with her loud'st Oyes
3977	Cries 'This is he,' could promise to himself
3978	A thought of added honour torn from Hector.
3979	
3980	AENEAS	There is expectance here from both the sides,
3981	What further you will do.
3982	
3983	HECTOR	We'll answer it;
3984	The issue is embracement: Ajax, farewell.
3985	
3986	AJAX	If I might in entreaties find success--
3987	As seld I have the chance--I would desire
3988	My famous cousin to our Grecian tents.
3989	
3990	DIOMEDES	'Tis Agamemnon's wish, and great Achilles
3991	Doth long to see unarm'd the valiant Hector.
3992	
3993	HECTOR	AEneas, call my brother Troilus to me,
3994	And signify this loving interview
3995	To the expecters of our Trojan part;
3996	Desire them home. Give me thy hand, my cousin;
3997	I will go eat with thee and see your knights.
3998	
3999	AJAX	Great Agamemnon comes to meet us here.
4000	
4001	HECTOR	The worthiest of them tell me name by name;
4002	But for Achilles, mine own searching eyes
4003	Shall find him by his large and portly size.
4004	
4005	AGAMEMNON	Worthy of arms! as welcome as to one
4006	That would be rid of such an enemy;
4007	But that's no welcome: understand more clear,
4008	What's past and what's to come is strew'd with husks
4009	And formless ruin of oblivion;
4010	But in this extant moment, faith and troth,
4011	Strain'd purely from all hollow bias-drawing,
4012	Bids thee, with most divine integrity,
4013	From heart of very heart, great Hector, welcome.
4014	
4015	HECTOR	I thank thee, most imperious Agamemnon.
4016	
4017	AGAMEMNON	[To TROILUS]  My well-famed lord of Troy, no
4018	less to you.
4019	
4020	MENELAUS	Let me confirm my princely brother's greeting:
4021	You brace of warlike brothers, welcome hither.
4022	
4023	HECTOR	Who must we answer?
4024	
4025	AENEAS	The noble Menelaus.
4026	
4027	HECTOR	O, you, my lord? by Mars his gauntlet, thanks!
4028	Mock not, that I affect the untraded oath;
4029	Your quondam wife swears still by Venus' glove:
4030	She's well, but bade me not commend her to you.
4031	
4032	MENELAUS	Name her not now, sir; she's a deadly theme.
4033	
4034	HECTOR	O, pardon; I offend.
4035	
4036	NESTOR	I have, thou gallant Trojan, seen thee oft
4037	Labouring for destiny make cruel way
4038	Through ranks of Greekish youth, and I have seen thee,
4039	As hot as Perseus, spur thy Phrygian steed,
4040	Despising many forfeits and subduements,
4041	When thou hast hung thy advanced sword i' the air,
4042	Not letting it decline on the declined,
4043	That I have said to some my standers by
4044	'Lo, Jupiter is yonder, dealing life!'
4045	And I have seen thee pause and take thy breath,
4046	When that a ring of Greeks have hemm'd thee in,
4047	Like an Olympian wrestling: this have I seen;
4048	But this thy countenance, still lock'd in steel,
4049	I never saw till now. I knew thy grandsire,
4050	And once fought with him: he was a soldier good;
4051	But, by great Mars, the captain of us all,
4052	Never saw like thee. Let an old man embrace thee;
4053	And, worthy warrior, welcome to our tents.
4054	
4055	AENEAS	'Tis the old Nestor.
4056	
4057	HECTOR	Let me embrace thee, good old chronicle,
4058	That hast so long walk'd hand in hand with time:
4059	Most reverend Nestor, I am glad to clasp thee.
4060	
4061	NESTOR	I would my arms could match thee in contention,
4062	As they contend with thee in courtesy.
4063	
4064	HECTOR	I would they could.
4065	
4066	NESTOR	Ha!
4067	By this white beard, I'ld fight with thee to-morrow.
4068	Well, welcome, welcome! I have seen the time.
4069	
4070	ULYSSES	I wonder now how yonder city stands
4071	When we have here her base and pillar by us.
4072	
4073	HECTOR	I know your favour, Lord Ulysses, well.
4074	Ah, sir, there's many a Greek and Trojan dead,
4075	Since first I saw yourself and Diomed
4076	In Ilion, on your Greekish embassy.
4077	
4078	ULYSSES	Sir, I foretold you then what would ensue:
4079	My prophecy is but half his journey yet;
4080	For yonder walls, that pertly front your town,
4081	Yond towers, whose wanton tops do buss the clouds,
4082	Must kiss their own feet.
4083	
4084	HECTOR	I must not believe you:
4085	There they stand yet, and modestly I think,
4086	The fall of every Phrygian stone will cost
4087	A drop of Grecian blood: the end crowns all,
4088	And that old common arbitrator, Time,
4089	Will one day end it.
4090	
4091	ULYSSES	So to him we leave it.
4092	Most gentle and most valiant Hector, welcome:
4093	After the general, I beseech you next
4094	To feast with me and see me at my tent.
4095	
4096	ACHILLES	I shall forestall thee, Lord Ulysses, thou!
4097	Now, Hector, I have fed mine eyes on thee;
4098	I have with exact view perused thee, Hector,
4099	And quoted joint by joint.
4100	
4101	HECTOR	Is this Achilles?
4102	
4103	ACHILLES	I am Achilles.
4104	
4105	HECTOR	Stand fair, I pray thee: let me look on thee.
4106	
4107	ACHILLES	Behold thy fill.
4108	
4109	HECTOR	                  Nay, I have done already.
4110	
4111	ACHILLES	Thou art too brief: I will the second time,
4112	As I would buy thee, view thee limb by limb.
4113	
4114	HECTOR	O, like a book of sport thou'lt read me o'er;
4115	But there's more in me than thou understand'st.
4116	Why dost thou so oppress me with thine eye?
4117	
4118	ACHILLES	Tell me, you heavens, in which part of his body
4119	Shall I destroy him? whether there, or there, or there?
4120	That I may give the local wound a name
4121	And make distinct the very breach whereout
4122	Hector's great spirit flew: answer me, heavens!
4123	
4124	HECTOR	It would discredit the blest gods, proud man,
4125	To answer such a question: stand again:
4126	Think'st thou to catch my life so pleasantly
4127	As to prenominate in nice conjecture
4128	Where thou wilt hit me dead?
4129	
4130	ACHILLES	I tell thee, yea.
4131	
4132	HECTOR	Wert thou an oracle to tell me so,
4133	I'd not believe thee. Henceforth guard thee well;
4134	For I'll not kill thee there, nor there, nor there;
4135	But, by the forge that stithied Mars his helm,
4136	I'll kill thee every where, yea, o'er and o'er.
4137	You wisest Grecians, pardon me this brag;
4138	His insolence draws folly from my lips;
4139	But I'll endeavour deeds to match these words,
4140	Or may I never--
4141	
4142	AJAX	                  Do not chafe thee, cousin:
4143	And you, Achilles, let these threats alone,
4144	Till accident or purpose bring you to't:
4145	You may have every day enough of Hector
4146	If you have stomach; the general state, I fear,
4147	Can scarce entreat you to be odd with him.
4148	
4149	HECTOR	I pray you, let us see you in the field:
4150	We have had pelting wars, since you refused
4151	The Grecians' cause.
4152	
4153	ACHILLES	Dost thou entreat me, Hector?
4154	To-morrow do I meet thee, fell as death;
4155	To-night all friends.
4156	
4157	HECTOR	Thy hand upon that match.
4158	
4159	AGAMEMNON	First, all you peers of Greece, go to my tent;
4160	There in the full convive we: afterwards,
4161	As Hector's leisure and your bounties shall
4162	Concur together, severally entreat him.
4163	Beat loud the tabourines, let the trumpets blow,
4164	That this great soldier may his welcome know.
4165	
4166	[Exeunt all except TROILUS and ULYSSES]
4167	
4168	TROILUS	My Lord Ulysses, tell me, I beseech you,
4169	In what place of the field doth Calchas keep?
4170	
4171	ULYSSES	At Menelaus' tent, most princely Troilus:
4172	There Diomed doth feast with him to-night;
4173	Who neither looks upon the heaven nor earth,
4174	But gives all gaze and bent of amorous view
4175	On the fair Cressid.
4176	
4177	TROILUS	Shall sweet lord, be bound to you so much,
4178	After we part from Agamemnon's tent,
4179	To bring me thither?
4180	
4181	ULYSSES	You shall command me, sir.
4182	As gentle tell me, of what honour was
4183	This Cressida in Troy? Had she no lover there
4184	That wails her absence?
4185	
4186	
4187	TROILUS	O, sir, to such as boasting show their scars
4188	A mock is due. Will you walk on, my lord?
4189	She was beloved, she loved; she is, and doth:
4190	But still sweet love is food for fortune's tooth.

4199	
4200	ACT V
4201	
4202	
4203	
4204	SCENE I	The Grecian camp. Before Achilles' tent.
4205	
4206	
4207	[Enter ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]
4208	
4209	ACHILLES	I'll heat his blood with Greekish wine to-night,
4210	Which with my scimitar I'll cool to-morrow.
4211	Patroclus, let us feast him to the height.
4212	
4213	PATROCLUS	Here comes Thersites.
4214	
4215	[Enter THERSITES]
4216	
4217	ACHILLES	How now, thou core of envy!
4218	Thou crusty batch of nature, what's the news?
4219	
4220	THERSITES	Why, thou picture of what thou seemest, and idol
4221	of idiot worshippers, here's a letter for thee.
4222	
4223	ACHILLES	From whence, fragment?
4224	
4225	THERSITES	Why, thou full dish of fool, from Troy.
4226	
4227	PATROCLUS	Who keeps the tent now?
4228	
4229	THERSITES	The surgeon's box, or the patient's wound.
4230	
4231	PATROCLUS	Well said, adversity! and what need these tricks?
4232	
4233	THERSITES	Prithee, be silent, boy; I profit not by thy talk:
4234	thou art thought to be Achilles' male varlet.
4235	
4236	PATROCLUS	Male varlet, you rogue! what's that?
4237	
4238	THERSITES	Why, his masculine whore. Now, the rotten diseases
4239	of the south, the guts-griping, ruptures, catarrhs,
4240	loads o' gravel i' the back, lethargies, cold
4241	palsies, raw eyes, dirt-rotten livers, wheezing
4242	lungs, bladders full of imposthume, sciaticas,
4243	limekilns i' the palm, incurable bone-ache, and the
4244	rivelled fee-simple of the tetter, take and take
4245	again such preposterous discoveries!
4246	
4247	PATROCLUS	Why thou damnable box of envy, thou, what meanest
4248	thou to curse thus?
4249	
4250	THERSITES	Do I curse thee?
4251	
4252	PATROCLUS	Why no, you ruinous butt, you whoreson
4253	indistinguishable cur, no.
4254	
4255	THERSITES	No! why art thou then exasperate, thou idle
4256	immaterial skein of sleave-silk, thou green sarcenet
4257	flap for a sore eye, thou tassel of a prodigal's
4258	purse, thou? Ah, how the poor world is pestered
4259	with such waterflies, diminutives of nature!
4260	
4261	PATROCLUS	Out, gall!
4262	
4263	THERSITES	Finch-egg!
4264	
4265	ACHILLES	My sweet Patroclus, I am thwarted quite
4266	From my great purpose in to-morrow's battle.
4267	Here is a letter from Queen Hecuba,
4268	A token from her daughter, my fair love,
4269	Both taxing me and gaging me to keep
4270	An oath that I have sworn. I will not break it:
4271	Fall Greeks; fail fame; honour or go or stay;
4272	My major vow lies here, this I'll obey.
4273	Come, come, Thersites, help to trim my tent:
4274	This night in banqueting must all be spent.
4275	Away, Patroclus!
4276	
4277	[Exeunt ACHILLES and PATROCLUS]
4278	
4279	THERSITES	With too much blood and too little brain, these two
4280	may run mad; but, if with too much brain and too
4281	little blood they do, I'll be a curer of madmen.
4282	Here's Agamemnon, an honest fellow enough and one
4283	that loves quails; but he has not so much brain as
4284	earwax: and the goodly transformation of Jupiter
4285	there, his brother, the bull,--the primitive statue,
4286	and oblique memorial of cuckolds; a thrifty
4287	shoeing-horn in a chain, hanging at his brother's
4288	leg,--to what form but that he is, should wit larded
4289	with malice and malice forced with wit turn him to?
4290	To an ass, were nothing; he is both ass and ox: to
4291	an ox, were nothing; he is both ox and ass. To be a
4292	dog, a mule, a cat, a fitchew, a toad, a lizard, an
4293	owl, a puttock, or a herring without a roe, I would
4294	not care; but to be Menelaus, I would conspire
4295	against destiny. Ask me not, what I would be, if I
4296	were not Thersites; for I care not to be the louse
4297	of a lazar, so I were not Menelaus! Hey-day!
4298	spirits and fires!
4299	
4300	[Enter HECTOR, TROILUS, AJAX, AGAMEMNON, ULYSSES,
4301	NESTOR, MENELAUS, and DIOMEDES, with lights]
4302	
4303	AGAMEMNON	We go wrong, we go wrong.
4304	
4305	AJAX	No, yonder 'tis;
4306	There, where we see the lights.
4307	
4308	HECTOR	I trouble you.
4309	
4310	AJAX	No, not a whit.
4311	
4312	ULYSSES	                  Here comes himself to guide you.
4313	
4314	[Re-enter ACHILLES]
4315	
4316	ACHILLES	Welcome, brave Hector; welcome, princes all.
4317	
4318	AGAMEMNON	So now, fair prince of Troy, I bid good night.
4319	Ajax commands the guard to tend on you.
4320	
4321	HECTOR	Thanks and good night to the Greeks' general.
4322	
4323	MENELAUS	Good night, my lord.
4324	
4325	HECTOR	Good night, sweet lord Menelaus.
4326	
4327	THERSITES	Sweet draught: 'sweet' quoth 'a! sweet sink,
4328	sweet sewer.
4329	
4330	ACHILLES	Good night and welcome, both at once, to those
4331	That go or tarry.
4332	
4333	AGAMEMNON	Good night.
4334	
4335	[Exeunt AGAMEMNON and MENELAUS]
4336	
4337	ACHILLES	Old Nestor tarries; and you too, Diomed,
4338	Keep Hector company an hour or two.
4339	
4340	DIOMEDES	I cannot, lord; I have important business,
4341	The tide whereof is now. Good night, great Hector.
4342	
4343	HECTOR	Give me your hand.
4344	
4345	ULYSSES	[Aside to TROILUS]  Follow his torch; he goes to
4346	Calchas' tent:
4347	I'll keep you company.
4348	
4349	TROILUS	Sweet sir, you honour me.
4350	
4351	HECTOR	And so, good night.
4352	
4353	[Exit DIOMEDES; ULYSSES and TROILUS following]
4354	
4355	ACHILLES	Come, come, enter my tent.
4356	
4357	[Exeunt ACHILLES, HECTOR, AJAX, and NESTOR]
4358	
4359	THERSITES	That same Diomed's a false-hearted rogue, a most
4360	unjust knave; I will no more trust him when he leers
4361	than I will a serpent when he hisses: he will spend
4362	his mouth, and promise, like Brabbler the hound:
4363	but when he performs, astronomers foretell it; it
4364	is prodigious, there will come some change; the sun
4365	borrows of the moon, when Diomed keeps his
4366	word. I will rather leave to see Hector, than
4367	not to dog him: they say he keeps a Trojan
4368	drab, and uses the traitor Calchas' tent: I'll
4369	after. Nothing but lechery! all incontinent varlets!
4370	
4371	[Exit]

4377	
4378	
4379	ACT V
4380	
4381	
4382	
4383	SCENE II	The same. Before Calchas' tent.
4384	
4385	
4386	[Enter DIOMEDES]
4387	
4388	DIOMEDES	What, are you up here, ho? speak.
4389	
4390	CALCHAS	[Within]  Who calls?
4391	
4392	DIOMEDES	Calchas, I think. Where's your daughter?
4393	
4394	CALCHAS	[Within]  She comes to you.
4395	
4396	[Enter TROILUS and ULYSSES, at a distance;
4397	after them, THERSITES]
4398	
4399	ULYSSES	Stand where the torch may not discover us.
4400	
4401	[Enter CRESSIDA]
4402	
4403	TROILUS	Cressid comes forth to him.
4404	
4405	DIOMEDES	How now, my charge!
4406	
4407	CRESSIDA	Now, my sweet guardian! Hark, a word with you.
4408	
4409	[Whispers]
4410	
4411	TROILUS	Yea, so familiar!
4412	
4413	ULYSSES	She will sing any man at first sight.
4414	
4415	THERSITES	And any man may sing her, if he can take her cliff;
4416	she's noted.
4417	
4418	DIOMEDES	Will you remember?
4419	
4420	CRESSIDA	Remember! yes.
4421	
4422	DIOMEDES	Nay, but do, then;
4423	And let your mind be coupled with your words.
4424	
4425	TROILUS	What should she remember?
4426	
4427	ULYSSES	List.
4428	
4429	CRESSIDA	Sweet honey Greek, tempt me no more to folly.
4430	
4431	THERSITES	Roguery!
4432	
4433	DIOMEDES	Nay, then,--
4434	
4435	CRESSIDA	I'll tell you what,--
4436	
4437	DIOMEDES	Foh, foh! come, tell a pin: you are forsworn.
4438	
4439	CRESSIDA	In faith, I cannot: what would you have me do?
4440	
4441	THERSITES	A juggling trick,--to be secretly open.
4442	
4443	DIOMEDES	What did you swear you would bestow on me?
4444	
4445	CRESSIDA	I prithee, do not hold me to mine oath;
4446	Bid me do any thing but that, sweet Greek.
4447	
4448	DIOMEDES	Good night.
4449	
4450	TROILUS	Hold, patience!
4451	
4452	ULYSSES	How now, Trojan!
4453	
4454	CRESSIDA	Diomed,--
4455	
4456	DIOMEDES	No, no, good night: I'll be your fool no more.
4457	
4458	TROILUS	Thy better must.
4459	
4460	CRESSIDA	Hark, one word in your ear.
4461	
4462	TROILUS	O plague and madness!
4463	
4464	ULYSSES	You are moved, prince; let us depart, I pray you,
4465	Lest your displeasure should enlarge itself
4466	To wrathful terms: this place is dangerous;
4467	The time right deadly; I beseech you, go.
4468	
4469	TROILUS	Behold, I pray you!
4470	
4471	ULYSSES	Nay, good my lord, go off:
4472	You flow to great distraction; come, my lord.
4473	
4474	TROILUS	I pray thee, stay.
4475	
4476	ULYSSES	                  You have not patience; come.
4477	
4478	TROILUS	I pray you, stay; by hell and all hell's torments
4479	I will not speak a word!
4480	
4481	DIOMEDES	And so, good night.
4482	
4483	CRESSIDA	Nay, but you part in anger.
4484	
4485	TROILUS	Doth that grieve thee?
4486	O wither'd truth!
4487	
4488	ULYSSES	                  Why, how now, lord!
4489	
4490	TROILUS	By Jove,
4491	I will be patient.
4492	
4493	CRESSIDA	                  Guardian!--why, Greek!
4494	
4495	DIOMEDES	Foh, foh! adieu; you palter.
4496	
4497	CRESSIDA	In faith, I do not: come hither once again.
4498	
4499	ULYSSES	You shake, my lord, at something: will you go?
4500	You will break out.
4501	
4502	TROILUS	She strokes his cheek!
4503	
4504	ULYSSES	Come, come.
4505	
4506	TROILUS	Nay, stay; by Jove, I will not speak a word:
4507	There is between my will and all offences
4508	A guard of patience: stay a little while.
4509	
4510	THERSITES	How the devil Luxury, with his fat rump and
4511	potato-finger, tickles these together! Fry, lechery, fry!
4512	
4513	DIOMEDES	But will you, then?
4514	
4515	CRESSIDA	In faith, I will, la; never trust me else.
4516	
4517	DIOMEDES	Give me some token for the surety of it.
4518	
4519	CRESSIDA	I'll fetch you one.
4520	
4521	[Exit]
4522	
4523	ULYSSES	You have sworn patience.
4524	
4525	TROILUS	Fear me not, sweet lord;
4526	I will not be myself, nor have cognition
4527	Of what I feel: I am all patience.
4528	
4529	[Re-enter CRESSIDA]
4530	
4531	THERSITES	Now the pledge; now, now, now!
4532	
4533	CRESSIDA	Here, Diomed, keep this sleeve.
4534	
4535	TROILUS	O beauty! where is thy faith?
4536	
4537	ULYSSES	My lord,--
4538	
4539	TROILUS	I will be patient; outwardly I will.
4540	
4541	CRESSIDA	You look upon that sleeve; behold it well.
4542	He loved me--O false wench!--Give't me again.
4543	
4544	DIOMEDES	Whose was't?
4545	
4546	CRESSIDA	It is no matter, now I have't again.
4547	I will not meet with you to-morrow night:
4548	I prithee, Diomed, visit me no more.
4549	
4550	THERSITES	Now she sharpens: well said, whetstone!
4551	
4552	DIOMEDES	I shall have it.
4553	
4554	CRESSIDA	                  What, this?
4555	
4556	DIOMEDES	Ay, that.
4557	
4558	CRESSIDA	O, all you gods! O pretty, pretty pledge!
4559	Thy master now lies thinking in his bed
4560	Of thee and me, and sighs, and takes my glove,
4561	And gives memorial dainty kisses to it,
4562	As I kiss thee. Nay, do not snatch it from me;
4563	He that takes that doth take my heart withal.
4564	
4565	DIOMEDES	I had your heart before, this follows it.
4566	
4567	TROILUS	I did swear patience.
4568	
4569	CRESSIDA	You shall not have it, Diomed; faith, you shall not;
4570	I'll give you something else.
4571	
4572	DIOMEDES	I will have this: whose was it?
4573	
4574	CRESSIDA	It is no matter.
4575	
4576	DIOMEDES	Come, tell me whose it was.
4577	
4578	CRESSIDA	'Twas one's that loved me better than you will.
4579	But, now you have it, take it.
4580	
4581	DIOMEDES	Whose was it?
4582	
4583	CRESSIDA	By all Diana's waiting-women yond,
4584	And by herself, I will not tell you whose.
4585	
4586	DIOMEDES	To-morrow will I wear it on my helm,
4587	And grieve his spirit that dares not challenge it.
4588	
4589	TROILUS	Wert thou the devil, and worest it on thy horn,
4590	It should be challenged.
4591	
4592	CRESSIDA	Well, well, 'tis done, 'tis past: and yet it is not;
4593	I will not keep my word.
4594	
4595	DIOMEDES	Why, then, farewell;
4596	Thou never shalt mock Diomed again.
4597	
4598	CRESSIDA	You shall not go: one cannot speak a word,
4599	But it straight starts you.
4600	
4601	DIOMEDES	I do not like this fooling.
4602	
4603	THERSITES	Nor I, by Pluto: but that that likes not you pleases me best.
4604	
4605	DIOMEDES	What, shall I come? the hour?
4606	
4607	CRESSIDA	Ay, come:--O Jove!--do come:--I shall be plagued.
4608	
4609	DIOMEDES	Farewell till then.
4610	
4611	CRESSIDA	Good night: I prithee, come.
4612	
4613	[Exit DIOMEDES]
4614	
4615	Troilus, farewell! one eye yet looks on thee
4616	But with my heart the other eye doth see.
4617	Ah, poor our sex! this fault in us I find,
4618	The error of our eye directs our mind:
4619	What error leads must err; O, then conclude
4620	Minds sway'd by eyes are full of turpitude.
4621	
4622	[Exit]
4623	
4624	THERSITES	A proof of strength she could not publish more,
4625	Unless she said ' My mind is now turn'd whore.'
4626	
4627	ULYSSES	All's done, my lord.
4628	
4629	TROILUS	It is.
4630	
4631	ULYSSES	Why stay we, then?
4632	
4633	TROILUS	To make a recordation to my soul
4634	Of every syllable that here was spoke.
4635	But if I tell how these two did co-act,
4636	Shall I not lie in publishing a truth?
4637	Sith yet there is a credence in my heart,
4638	An esperance so obstinately strong,
4639	That doth invert the attest of eyes and ears,
4640	As if those organs had deceptious functions,
4641	Created only to calumniate.
4642	Was Cressid here?
4643	
4644	ULYSSES	                  I cannot conjure, Trojan.
4645	
4646	TROILUS	She was not, sure.
4647	
4648	ULYSSES	                  Most sure she was.
4649	
4650	TROILUS	Why, my negation hath no taste of madness.
4651	
4652	ULYSSES	Nor mine, my lord: Cressid was here but now.
4653	
4654	TROILUS	Let it not be believed for womanhood!
4655	Think, we had mothers; do not give advantage
4656	To stubborn critics, apt, without a theme,
4657	For depravation, to square the general sex
4658	By Cressid's rule: rather think this not Cressid.
4659	
4660	ULYSSES	What hath she done, prince, that can soil our mothers?
4661	
4662	TROILUS	Nothing at all, unless that this were she.
4663	
4664	THERSITES	Will he swagger himself out on's own eyes?
4665	
4666	TROILUS	This she? no, this is Diomed's Cressida:
4667	If beauty have a soul, this is not she;
4668	If souls guide vows, if vows be sanctimonies,
4669	If sanctimony be the gods' delight,
4670	If there be rule in unity itself,
4671	This is not she. O madness of discourse,
4672	That cause sets up with and against itself!
4673	Bi-fold authority! where reason can revolt
4674	Without perdition, and loss assume all reason
4675	Without revolt: this is, and is not, Cressid.
4676	Within my soul there doth conduce a fight
4677	Of this strange nature that a thing inseparate
4678	Divides more wider than the sky and earth,
4679	And yet the spacious breadth of this division
4680	Admits no orifex for a point as subtle
4681	As Ariachne's broken woof to enter.
4682	Instance, O instance! strong as Pluto's gates;
4683	Cressid is mine, tied with the bonds of heaven:
4684	Instance, O instance! strong as heaven itself;
4685	The bonds of heaven are slipp'd, dissolved, and loosed;
4686	And with another knot, five-finger-tied,
4687	The fractions of her faith, orts of her love,
4688	The fragments, scraps, the bits and greasy relics
4689	Of her o'er-eaten faith, are bound to Diomed.
4690	
4691	ULYSSES	May worthy Troilus be half attach'd
4692	With that which here his passion doth express?
4693	
4694	TROILUS	Ay, Greek; and that shall be divulged well
4695	In characters as red as Mars his heart
4696	Inflamed with Venus: never did young man fancy
4697	With so eternal and so fix'd a soul.
4698	Hark, Greek: as much as I do Cressid love,
4699	So much by weight hate I her Diomed:
4700	That sleeve is mine that he'll bear on his helm;
4701	Were it a casque composed by Vulcan's skill,
4702	My sword should bite it: not the dreadful spout
4703	Which shipmen do the hurricano call,
4704	Constringed in mass by the almighty sun,
4705	Shall dizzy with more clamour Neptune's ear
4706	In his descent than shall my prompted sword
4707	Falling on Diomed.
4708	
4709	THERSITES	He'll tickle it for his concupy.
4710	
4711	TROILUS	O Cressid! O false Cressid! false, false, false!
4712	Let all untruths stand by thy stained name,
4713	And they'll seem glorious.
4714	
4715	ULYSSES	O, contain yourself
4716	Your passion draws ears hither.
4717	
4718	[Enter AENEAS]
4719	
4720	AENEAS	I have been seeking you this hour, my lord:
4721	Hector, by this, is arming him in Troy;
4722	Ajax, your guard, stays to conduct you home.
4723	
4724	
4725	TROILUS	Have with you, prince. My courteous lord, adieu.
4726	Farewell, revolted fair! and, Diomed,
4727	Stand fast, and wear a castle on thy head!
4728	
4729	ULYSSES	I'll bring you to the gates.
4730	
4731	TROILUS	Accept distracted thanks.
4732	
4733	[Exeunt TROILUS, AENEAS, and ULYSSES]
4734	
4735	THERSITES	Would I could meet that rogue Diomed! I would
4736	croak like a raven; I would bode, I would bode.
4737	Patroclus will give me any thing for the
4738	intelligence of this whore: the parrot will not
4739	do more for an almond than he for a commodious drab.
4740	Lechery, lechery; still, wars and lechery; nothing
4741	else holds fashion: a burning devil take them!

4755	SCENE III	Troy. Before Priam's palace.
4756	
4757	
4758	[Enter HECTOR and ANDROMACHE]
4759	
4760	ANDROMACHE	When was my lord so much ungently temper'd,
4761	To stop his ears against admonishment?
4762	Unarm, unarm, and do not fight to-day.
4763	
4764	HECTOR	You train me to offend you; get you in:
4765	By all the everlasting gods, I'll go!
4766	
4767	ANDROMACHE	My dreams will, sure, prove ominous to the day.
4768	
4769	HECTOR	No more, I say.
4770	
4771	[Enter CASSANDRA]
4772	
4773	CASSANDRA	                  Where is my brother Hector?
4774	
4775	ANDROMACHE	Here, sister; arm'd, and bloody in intent.
4776	Consort with me in loud and dear petition,
4777	Pursue we him on knees; for I have dream'd
4778	Of bloody turbulence, and this whole night
4779	Hath nothing been but shapes and forms of slaughter.
4780	
4781	CASSANDRA	O, 'tis true.
4782	
4783	HECTOR	                  Ho! bid my trumpet sound!
4784	
4785	CASSANDRA	No notes of sally, for the heavens, sweet brother.
4786	
4787	HECTOR	Be gone, I say: the gods have heard me swear.
4788	
4789	CASSANDRA	The gods are deaf to hot and peevish vows:
4790	They are polluted offerings, more abhorr'd
4791	Than spotted livers in the sacrifice.
4792	
4793	ANDROMACHE	O, be persuaded! do not count it holy
4794	To hurt by being just: it is as lawful,
4795	For we would give much, to use violent thefts,
4796	And rob in the behalf of charity.
4797	
4798	CASSANDRA	It is the purpose that makes strong the vow;
4799	But vows to every purpose must not hold:
4800	Unarm, sweet Hector.
4801	
4802	HECTOR	Hold you still, I say;
4803	Mine honour keeps the weather of my fate:
4804	Lie every man holds dear; but the brave man
4805	Holds honour far more precious-dear than life.
4806	
4807	[Enter TROILUS]
4808	
4809	How now, young man! mean'st thou to fight to-day?
4810	
4811	ANDROMACHE	Cassandra, call my father to persuade.
4812	
4813	[Exit CASSANDRA]
4814	
4815	HECTOR	No, faith, young Troilus; doff thy harness, youth;
4816	I am to-day i' the vein of chivalry:
4817	Let grow thy sinews till their knots be strong,
4818	And tempt not yet the brushes of the war.
4819	Unarm thee, go, and doubt thou not, brave boy,
4820	I'll stand to-day for thee and me and Troy.
4821	
4822	TROILUS	Brother, you have a vice of mercy in you,
4823	Which better fits a lion than a man.
4824	
4825	HECTOR	What vice is that, good Troilus? chide me for it.
4826	
4827	TROILUS	When many times the captive Grecian falls,
4828	Even in the fan and wind of your fair sword,
4829	You bid them rise, and live.
4830	
4831	HECTOR	O,'tis fair play.
4832	
4833	TROILUS	                  Fool's play, by heaven, Hector.
4834	
4835	HECTOR	How now! how now!
4836	
4837	TROILUS	                  For the love of all the gods,
4838	Let's leave the hermit pity with our mothers,
4839	And when we have our armours buckled on,
4840	The venom'd vengeance ride upon our swords,
4841	Spur them to ruthful work, rein them from ruth.
4842	
4843	HECTOR	Fie, savage, fie!
4844	
4845	TROILUS	                  Hector, then 'tis wars.
4846	
4847	HECTOR	Troilus, I would not have you fight to-day.
4848	
4849	TROILUS	Who should withhold me?
4850	Not fate, obedience, nor the hand of Mars
4851	Beckoning with fiery truncheon my retire;
4852	Not Priamus and Hecuba on knees,
4853	Their eyes o'ergalled with recourse of tears;
4854	Not you, my brother, with your true sword drawn,
4855	Opposed to hinder me, should stop my way,
4856	But by my ruin.
4857	
4858	[Re-enter CASSANDRA, with PRIAM]
4859	
4860	CASSANDRA	Lay hold upon him, Priam, hold him fast:
4861	He is thy crutch; now if thou lose thy stay,
4862	Thou on him leaning, and all Troy on thee,
4863	Fall all together.
4864	
4865	PRIAM	                  Come, Hector, come, go back:
4866	Thy wife hath dream'd; thy mother hath had visions;
4867	Cassandra doth foresee; and I myself
4868	Am like a prophet suddenly enrapt
4869	To tell thee that this day is ominous:
4870	Therefore, come back.
4871	
4872	HECTOR	AEneas is a-field;
4873	And I do stand engaged to many Greeks,
4874	Even in the faith of valour, to appear
4875	This morning to them.
4876	
4877	PRIAM	Ay, but thou shalt not go.
4878	
4879	HECTOR	I must not break my faith.
4880	You know me dutiful; therefore, dear sir,
4881	Let me not shame respect; but give me leave
4882	To take that course by your consent and voice,
4883	Which you do here forbid me, royal Priam.
4884	
4885	CASSANDRA	O Priam, yield not to him!
4886	
4887	ANDROMACHE	Do not, dear father.
4888	
4889	HECTOR	Andromache, I am offended with you:
4890	Upon the love you bear me, get you in.
4891	
4892	[Exit ANDROMACHE]
4893	
4894	TROILUS	This foolish, dreaming, superstitious girl
4895	Makes all these bodements.
4896	
4897	CASSANDRA	O, farewell, dear Hector!
4898	Look, how thou diest! look, how thy eye turns pale!
4899	Look, how thy wounds do bleed at many vents!
4900	Hark, how Troy roars! how Hecuba cries out!
4901	How poor Andromache shrills her dolours forth!
4902	Behold, distraction, frenzy and amazement,
4903	Like witless antics, one another meet,
4904	And all cry, Hector! Hector's dead! O Hector!
4905	
4906	TROILUS	Away! away!
4907	
4908	CASSANDRA	Farewell: yet, soft! Hector! take my leave:
4909	Thou dost thyself and all our Troy deceive.
4910	
4911	[Exit]
4912	
4913	HECTOR	You are amazed, my liege, at her exclaim:
4914	Go in and cheer the town: we'll forth and fight,
4915	Do deeds worth praise and tell you them at night.
4916	
4917	PRIAM	Farewell: the gods with safety stand about thee!
4918	
4919	[Exeunt severally PRIAM and HECTOR. Alarums]
4920	
4921	TROILUS	They are at it, hark! Proud Diomed, believe,
4922	I come to lose my arm, or win my sleeve.

4924	[Enter PANDARUS]
4925	
4926	PANDARUS	Do you hear, my lord? do you hear?
4927	
4928	TROILUS	What now?
4929	
4930	PANDARUS	Here's a letter come from yond poor girl.
4931	
4932	TROILUS	Let me read.
4933	
4934	PANDARUS	A whoreson tisick, a whoreson rascally tisick so
4935	troubles me, and the foolish fortune of this girl;
4936	and what one thing, what another, that I shall
4937	leave you one o' these days: and I have a rheum
4938	in mine eyes too, and such an ache in my bones
4939	that, unless a man were cursed, I cannot tell what
4940	to think on't. What says she there?
4941	
4942	TROILUS	Words, words, mere words, no matter from the heart:
4943	The effect doth operate another way.
4944	
4945	[Tearing the letter]
4946	
4947	Go, wind, to wind, there turn and change together.
4948	My love with words and errors still she feeds;
4949	But edifies another with her deeds.

4965	
4966	[Alarums: excursions. Enter THERSITES]
4967	
4968	THERSITES	Now they are clapper-clawing one another; I'll go
4969	look on. That dissembling abominable varlets Diomed,
4970	has got that same scurvy doting foolish young knave's
4971	sleeve of Troy there in his helm: I would fain see
4972	them meet; that that same young Trojan ass, that
4973	loves the whore there, might send that Greekish
4974	whore-masterly villain, with the sleeve, back to the
4975	dissembling luxurious drab, of a sleeveless errand.
4976	O' the t'other side, the policy of those crafty
4977	swearing rascals, that stale old mouse-eaten dry
4978	cheese, Nestor, and that same dog-fox, Ulysses, is
4979	not proved worthy a blackberry: they set me up, in
4980	policy, that mongrel cur, Ajax, against that dog of
4981	as bad a kind, Achilles: and now is the cur Ajax
4982	prouder than the cur Achilles, and will not arm
4983	to-day; whereupon the Grecians begin to proclaim
4984	barbarism, and policy grows into an ill opinion.
4985	Soft! here comes sleeve, and t'other.
4986	
4987	[Enter DIOMEDES, TROILUS following]
4988	
4989	TROILUS	Fly not; for shouldst thou take the river Styx,
4990	I would swim after.
4991	
4992	DIOMEDES	Thou dost miscall retire:
4993	I do not fly, but advantageous care
4994	Withdrew me from the odds of multitude:
4995	Have at thee!
4996

5005	Art thou of blood and honour?
5006	
5007	THERSITES	No, no, I am a rascal; a scurvy railing knave:
5008	a very filthy rogue.
5009	
5010	HECTOR	I do believe thee: live.
5011	
5012	[Exit]

5056	Amphimachus and Thoas deadly hurt,
5057	Patroclus ta'en or slain, and Palamedes

5063	
5064	NESTOR	Go, bear Patroclus' body to Achilles;
5065	And bid the snail-paced Ajax arm for shame.
5066	There is a thousand Hectors in the field:
5067	Now here he fights on Galathe his horse,
5068	And there lacks work; anon he's there afoot,
5069	And there they fly or die, like scaled sculls
5070	Before the belching whale; then is he yonder,
5071	And there the strawy Greeks, ripe for his edge,
5072	Fall down before him, like the mower's swath:
5073	Here, there, and every where, he leaves and takes,
5074	Dexterity so obeying appetite
5075	That what he will he does, and does so much
5076	That proof is call'd impossibility.
5077	
5078	[Enter ULYSSES]
5079	
5080	ULYSSES	O, courage, courage, princes! great Achilles
5081	Is arming, weeping, cursing, vowing vengeance:
5082	Patroclus' wounds have roused his drowsy blood,
5083	Together with his mangled Myrmidons,
5084	That noseless, handless, hack'd and chipp'd, come to him,
5085	Crying on Hector. Ajax hath lost a friend
5086	And foams at mouth, and he is arm'd and at it,
5087	Roaring for Troilus, who hath done to-day
5088	Mad and fantastic execution,
5089	Engaging and redeeming of himself
5090	With such a careless force and forceless care

5136	DIOMEDES	I would correct him.

5166	ACHILLES	I do disdain thy courtesy, proud Trojan:
5167	Be happy that my arms are out of use:

5172	[Exit]

5246	not bite another, and wherefore should one bastard?
5247	Take heed, the quarrel's most ominous to us: if the
5248	son of a whore fight for a whore, he tempts judgment:
5249	farewell, bastard.

5267	SCENE VIII	Another part of the plains.
5268	
5269	
5270	[Enter HECTOR]
5271	
5272	HECTOR	Most putrefied core, so fair without,
5273	Thy goodly armour thus hath cost thy life.
5274	Now is my day's work done; I'll take good breath:
5275	Rest, sword; thou hast thy fill of blood and death.
5276	
5277	[Puts off his helmet and hangs his shield
5278	behind him]
5279	
5280	[Enter ACHILLES and Myrmidons]
5281	
5282	ACHILLES	Look, Hector, how the sun begins to set;
5283	How ugly night comes breathing at his heels:
5284	Even with the vail and darking of the sun,
5285	To close the day up, Hector's life is done.
5286	
5287	HECTOR	I am unarm'd; forego this vantage, Greek.
5288	
5289	ACHILLES	Strike, fellows, strike; this is the man I seek.
5290	
5291	[HECTOR falls]
5292	
5293	So, Ilion, fall thou next! now, Troy, sink down!
5294	Here lies thy heart, thy sinews, and thy bone.
5295	On, Myrmidons, and cry you all amain,
5296	'Achilles hath the mighty Hector slain.'
5297	
5298	[A retreat sounded]
5299	
5300	Hark! a retire upon our Grecian part.
5301	
5302	MYRMIDONS	The Trojan trumpets sound the like, my lord.
5303	
5304	ACHILLES	The dragon wing of night o'erspreads the earth,
5305	And, stickler-like, the armies separates.
5306	My half-supp'd sword, that frankly would have fed,
5307	Pleased with this dainty bait, thus goes to bed.
5308	
5309	[Sheathes his sword]
5310	
5311	Come, tie his body to my horse's tail;
5312	Along the field I will the Trojan trail.

5328	
5329	[Enter AGAMEMNON, AJAX, MENELAUS, NESTOR, DIOMEDES,
5330	and others, marching. Shouts within]
5331	
5332	AGAMEMNON	Hark! hark! what shout is that?
5333	
5334	NESTOR	Peace, drums!
5335	
5336	[Within]
5337	
5338	Achilles! Achilles! Hector's slain! Achilles.
5339	
5340	DIOMEDES	The bruit is, Hector's slain, and by Achilles.
5341	
5342	AJAX	If it be so, yet bragless let it be;
5343	Great Hector was a man as good as he.
5344	
5345	AGAMEMNON	March patiently along: let one be sent
5346	To pray Achilles see us at our tent.
5347	If in his death the gods have us befriended,
5348	Great Troy is ours, and our sharp wars are ended.

5363	
5364	
5365	[Enter AENEAS and Trojans]
5366	
5367	AENEAS	Stand, ho! yet are we masters of the field:
5368	Never go home; here starve we out the night.
5369	
5370	[Enter TROILUS]
5371	
5372	TROILUS	Hector is slain.
5373	
5374	ALL	                  Hector! the gods forbid!
5375	
5376	TROILUS	He's dead; and at the murderer's horse's tail,
5377	In beastly sort, dragg'd through the shameful field.
5378	Frown on, you heavens, effect your rage with speed!
5379	Sit, gods, upon your thrones, and smile at Troy!
5380	I say, at once let your brief plagues be mercy,
5381	And linger not our sure destructions on!
5382	
5383	AENEAS	My lord, you do discomfort all the host!
5384	
5385	TROILUS	You understand me not that tell me so:
5386	I do not speak of flight, of fear, of death,
5387	But dare all imminence that gods and men
5388	Address their dangers in. Hector is gone:
5389	Who shall tell Priam so, or Hecuba?
5390	Let him that will a screech-owl aye be call'd,
5391	Go in to Troy, and say there, Hector's dead:
5392	There is a word will Priam turn to stone;
5393	Make wells and Niobes of the maids and wives,
5394	Cold statues of the youth, and, in a word,
5395	Scare Troy out of itself. But, march away:
5396	Hector is dead; there is no more to say.
5397	Stay yet. You vile abominable tents,
5398	Thus proudly pight upon our Phrygian plains,
5399	Let Titan rise as early as he dare,
5400	I'll through and through you! and, thou great-sized coward,
5401	No space of earth shall sunder our two hates:
5402	I'll haunt thee like a wicked conscience still,
5403	That mouldeth goblins swift as frenzy's thoughts.
5404	Strike a free march to Troy! with comfort go:
5405	Hope of revenge shall hide our inward woe.
5406	
5407	[Exeunt AENEAS and Trojans]
5408	
5409	[As TROILUS is going out, enter, from the other
5410	side, PANDARUS]
5411	
5412	PANDARUS	But hear you, hear you!
5413	
5414	TROILUS	Hence, broker-lackey! ignomy and shame
5415	Pursue thy life, and live aye with thy name!
5416	
5417	[Exit]
5418	
5419	PANDARUS	A goodly medicine for my aching bones! O world!
5420	world! world! thus is the poor agent despised!
5421	O traitors and bawds, how earnestly are you set
5422	a-work, and how ill requited! why should our
5423	endeavour be so loved and the performance so loathed?
5424	what verse for it? what instance for it? Let me see:
5425	Full merrily the humble-bee doth sing,
5426	Till he hath lost his honey and his sting;
5427	And being once subdued in armed tail,
5428	Sweet honey and sweet notes together fail.
5429	Good traders in the flesh, set this in your
5430	painted cloths.
5431	As many as be here of pander's hall,
5432	Your eyes, half out, weep out at Pandar's fall;
5433	Or if you cannot weep, yet give some groans,
5434	Though not for me, yet for your aching bones.
5435	Brethren and sisters of the hold-door trade,
5436	Some two months hence my will shall here be made:
5437	It should be now, but that my fear is this,
5438	Some galled goose of Winchester would hiss:
5439	Till then I'll sweat and seek about for eases,
5440	And at that time bequeathe you my diseases.
5441	
5442	[Exit]

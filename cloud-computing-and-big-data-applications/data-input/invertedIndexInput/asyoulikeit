80	[Enter ORLANDO and ADAM]
81	
82	ORLANDO	As I remember, Adam, it was upon this fashion
83	bequeathed me by will but poor a thousand crowns,
84	and, as thou sayest, charged my brother, on his
85	blessing, to breed me well: and there begins my
86	sadness. My brother Jaques he keeps at school, and
87	report speaks goldenly of his profit: for my part,
88	he keeps me rustically at home, or, to speak more
89	properly, stays me here at home unkept; for call you
90	that keeping for a gentleman of my birth, that
91	differs not from the stalling of an ox? His horses
92	are bred better; for, besides that they are fair
93	with their feeding, they are taught their manage,
94	and to that end riders dearly hired: but I, his
95	brother, gain nothing under him but growth; for the
96	which his animals on his dunghills are as much
97	bound to him as I. Besides this nothing that he so
98	plentifully gives me, the something that nature gave
99	me his countenance seems to take from me: he lets
100	me feed with his hinds, bars me the place of a
101	brother, and, as much as in him lies, mines my
102	gentility with my education. This is it, Adam, that
103	grieves me; and the spirit of my father, which I
104	think is within me, begins to mutiny against this
105	servitude: I will no longer endure it, though yet I
106	know no wise remedy how to avoid it.
107	
108	ADAM	Yonder comes my master, your brother.
109	
110	ORLANDO	Go apart, Adam, and thou shalt hear how he will
111	shake me up.
112	
113	[Enter OLIVER]
114	
115	OLIVER	Now, sir! what make you here?
116	
117	ORLANDO	Nothing: I am not taught to make any thing.
118	
119	OLIVER	What mar you then, sir?
120	
121	ORLANDO	Marry, sir, I am helping you to mar that which God
122	made, a poor unworthy brother of yours, with idleness.
123	
124	OLIVER	Marry, sir, be better employed, and be naught awhile.
125	
126	ORLANDO	Shall I keep your hogs and eat husks with them?
127	What prodigal portion have I spent, that I should
128	come to such penury?
129	
130	OLIVER	Know you where your are, sir?
131	
132	ORLANDO	O, sir, very well; here in your orchard.
133	
134	OLIVER	Know you before whom, sir?
135	
136	ORLANDO	Ay, better than him I am before knows me. I know
137	you are my eldest brother; and, in the gentle
138	condition of blood, you should so know me. The
139	courtesy of nations allows you my better, in that
140	you are the first-born; but the same tradition
141	takes not away my blood, were there twenty brothers
142	betwixt us: I have as much of my father in me as
143	you; albeit, I confess, your coming before me is
144	nearer to his reverence.
145	
146	OLIVER	What, boy!
147	
148	ORLANDO	Come, come, elder brother, you are too young in this.
149	
150	OLIVER	Wilt thou lay hands on me, villain?
151	
152	ORLANDO	I am no villain; I am the youngest son of Sir
153	Rowland de Boys; he was my father, and he is thrice
154	a villain that says such a father begot villains.
155	Wert thou not my brother, I would not take this hand
156	from thy throat till this other had pulled out thy
157	tongue for saying so: thou hast railed on thyself.
158	
159	ADAM	Sweet masters, be patient: for your father's
160	remembrance, be at accord.
161	
162	OLIVER	Let me go, I say.
163	
164	ORLANDO	I will not, till I please: you shall hear me. My
165	father charged you in his will to give me good
166	education: you have trained me like a peasant,
167	obscuring and hiding from me all gentleman-like
168	qualities. The spirit of my father grows strong in
169	me, and I will no longer endure it: therefore allow
170	me such exercises as may become a gentleman, or
171	give me the poor allottery my father left me by
172	testament; with that I will go buy my fortunes.
173	
174	OLIVER	And what wilt thou do? beg, when that is spent?
175	Well, sir, get you in: I will not long be troubled
176	with you; you shall have some part of your will: I
177	pray you, leave me.
178	
179	ORLANDO	I will no further offend you than becomes me for my good.
180	
181	OLIVER	Get you with him, you old dog.
182	
183	ADAM	Is 'old dog' my reward? Most true, I have lost my
184	teeth in your service. God be with my old master!
185	he would not have spoke such a word.
186	
187	[Exeunt ORLANDO and ADAM]
188	
189	OLIVER	Is it even so? begin you to grow upon me? I will
190	physic your rankness, and yet give no thousand
191	crowns neither. Holla, Dennis!
192	
193	[Enter DENNIS]
194	
195	DENNIS	Calls your worship?
196	
197	OLIVER	Was not Charles, the duke's wrestler, here to speak with me?
198	
199	DENNIS	So please you, he is here at the door and importunes
200	access to you.
201	
202	OLIVER	Call him in.
203	
204	[Exit DENNIS]
205	
206	'Twill be a good way; and to-morrow the wrestling is.
207	
208	[Enter CHARLES]
209	
210	CHARLES	Good morrow to your worship.
211	
212	OLIVER	Good Monsieur Charles, what's the new news at the
213	new court?
214	
215	CHARLES	There's no news at the court, sir, but the old news:
216	that is, the old duke is banished by his younger
217	brother the new duke; and three or four loving lords
218	have put themselves into voluntary exile with him,
219	whose lands and revenues enrich the new duke;
220	therefore he gives them good leave to wander.
221	
222	OLIVER	Can you tell if Rosalind, the duke's daughter, be
223	banished with her father?
224	
225	CHARLES	O, no; for the duke's daughter, her cousin, so loves
226	her, being ever from their cradles bred together,
227	that she would have followed her exile, or have died
228	to stay behind her. She is at the court, and no
229	less beloved of her uncle than his own daughter; and
230	never two ladies loved as they do.
231	
232	OLIVER	Where will the old duke live?
233	
234	CHARLES	They say he is already in the forest of Arden, and
235	a many merry men with him; and there they live like
236	the old Robin Hood of England: they say many young
237	gentlemen flock to him every day, and fleet the time
238	carelessly, as they did in the golden world.
239	
240	OLIVER	What, you wrestle to-morrow before the new duke?
241	
242	CHARLES	Marry, do I, sir; and I came to acquaint you with a
243	matter. I am given, sir, secretly to understand
244	that your younger brother Orlando hath a disposition
245	to come in disguised against me to try a fall.
246	To-morrow, sir, I wrestle for my credit; and he that
247	escapes me without some broken limb shall acquit him
248	well. Your brother is but young and tender; and,
249	for your love, I would be loath to foil him, as I
250	must, for my own honour, if he come in: therefore,
251	out of my love to you, I came hither to acquaint you
252	withal, that either you might stay him from his
253	intendment or brook such disgrace well as he shall
254	run into, in that it is a thing of his own search
255	and altogether against my will.
256	
257	OLIVER	Charles, I thank thee for thy love to me, which
258	thou shalt find I will most kindly requite. I had
259	myself notice of my brother's purpose herein and
260	have by underhand means laboured to dissuade him from
261	it, but he is resolute. I'll tell thee, Charles:
262	it is the stubbornest young fellow of France, full
263	of ambition, an envious emulator of every man's
264	good parts, a secret and villanous contriver against
265	me his natural brother: therefore use thy
266	discretion; I had as lief thou didst break his neck
267	as his finger. And thou wert best look to't; for if
268	thou dost him any slight disgrace or if he do not
269	mightily grace himself on thee, he will practise
270	against thee by poison, entrap thee by some
271	treacherous device and never leave thee till he
272	hath ta'en thy life by some indirect means or other;
273	for, I assure thee, and almost with tears I speak
274	it, there is not one so young and so villanous this
275	day living. I speak but brotherly of him; but
276	should I anatomize him to thee as he is, I must
277	blush and weep and thou must look pale and wonder.
278	
279	CHARLES	I am heartily glad I came hither to you. If he come
280	to-morrow, I'll give him his payment: if ever he go
281	alone again, I'll never wrestle for prize more: and
282	so God keep your worship!
283	
284	OLIVER	Farewell, good Charles.
285	
286	[Exit CHARLES]
287	
288	Now will I stir this gamester: I hope I shall see
289	an end of him; for my soul, yet I know not why,
290	hates nothing more than he. Yet he's gentle, never
291	schooled and yet learned, full of noble device, of
292	all sorts enchantingly beloved, and indeed so much
293	in the heart of the world, and especially of my own
294	people, who best know him, that I am altogether
295	misprised: but it shall not be so long; this
296	wrestler shall clear all: nothing remains but that
297	I kindle the boy thither; which now I'll go about.

311	SCENE II	Lawn before the Duke's palace.
312	
313	
314	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]
315	
316	CELIA	I pray thee, Rosalind, sweet my coz, be merry.
317	
318	ROSALIND	Dear Celia, I show more mirth than I am mistress of;
319	and would you yet I were merrier? Unless you could
320	teach me to forget a banished father, you must not
321	learn me how to remember any extraordinary pleasure.
322	
323	CELIA	Herein I see thou lovest me not with the full weight
324	that I love thee. If my uncle, thy banished father,
325	had banished thy uncle, the duke my father, so thou
326	hadst been still with me, I could have taught my
327	love to take thy father for mine: so wouldst thou,
328	if the truth of thy love to me were so righteously
329	tempered as mine is to thee.
330	
331	ROSALIND	Well, I will forget the condition of my estate, to
332	rejoice in yours.
333	
334	CELIA	You know my father hath no child but I, nor none is
335	like to have: and, truly, when he dies, thou shalt
336	be his heir, for what he hath taken away from thy
337	father perforce, I will render thee again in
338	affection; by mine honour, I will; and when I break
339	that oath, let me turn monster: therefore, my
340	sweet Rose, my dear Rose, be merry.
341	
342	ROSALIND	From henceforth I will, coz, and devise sports. Let
343	me see; what think you of falling in love?
344	
345	CELIA	Marry, I prithee, do, to make sport withal: but
346	love no man in good earnest; nor no further in sport
347	neither than with safety of a pure blush thou mayst
348	in honour come off again.
349	
350	ROSALIND	What shall be our sport, then?
351	
352	CELIA	Let us sit and mock the good housewife Fortune from
353	her wheel, that her gifts may henceforth be bestowed equally.
354	
355	ROSALIND	I would we could do so, for her benefits are
356	mightily misplaced, and the bountiful blind woman
357	doth most mistake in her gifts to women.
358	
359	CELIA	'Tis true; for those that she makes fair she scarce
360	makes honest, and those that she makes honest she
361	makes very ill-favouredly.
362	
363	ROSALIND	Nay, now thou goest from Fortune's office to
364	Nature's: Fortune reigns in gifts of the world,
365	not in the lineaments of Nature.
366	
367	[Enter TOUCHSTONE]
368	
369	CELIA	No? when Nature hath made a fair creature, may she
370	not by Fortune fall into the fire? Though Nature
371	hath given us wit to flout at Fortune, hath not
372	Fortune sent in this fool to cut off the argument?
373	
374	ROSALIND	Indeed, there is Fortune too hard for Nature, when
375	Fortune makes Nature's natural the cutter-off of
376	Nature's wit.
377	
378	CELIA	Peradventure this is not Fortune's work neither, but
379	Nature's; who perceiveth our natural wits too dull
380	to reason of such goddesses and hath sent this
381	natural for our whetstone; for always the dulness of
382	the fool is the whetstone of the wits. How now,
383	wit! whither wander you?
384	
385	TOUCHSTONE	Mistress, you must come away to your father.
386	
387	CELIA	Were you made the messenger?
388	
389	TOUCHSTONE	No, by mine honour, but I was bid to come for you.
390	
391	ROSALIND	Where learned you that oath, fool?
392	
393	TOUCHSTONE	Of a certain knight that swore by his honour they
394	were good pancakes and swore by his honour the
395	mustard was naught: now I'll stand to it, the
396	pancakes were naught and the mustard was good, and
397	yet was not the knight forsworn.
398	
399	CELIA	How prove you that, in the great heap of your
400	knowledge?
401	
402	ROSALIND	Ay, marry, now unmuzzle your wisdom.
403	
404	TOUCHSTONE	Stand you both forth now: stroke your chins, and
405	swear by your beards that I am a knave.
406	
407	CELIA	By our beards, if we had them, thou art.
408	
409	TOUCHSTONE	By my knavery, if I had it, then I were; but if you
410	swear by that that is not, you are not forsworn: no
411	more was this knight swearing by his honour, for he
412	never had any; or if he had, he had sworn it away
413	before ever he saw those pancakes or that mustard.
414	
415	CELIA	Prithee, who is't that thou meanest?
416	
417	TOUCHSTONE	One that old Frederick, your father, loves.
418	
419	CELIA	My father's love is enough to honour him: enough!
420	speak no more of him; you'll be whipped for taxation
421	one of these days.
422	
423	TOUCHSTONE	The more pity, that fools may not speak wisely what
424	wise men do foolishly.
425	
426	CELIA	By my troth, thou sayest true; for since the little
427	wit that fools have was silenced, the little foolery
428	that wise men have makes a great show. Here comes
429	Monsieur Le Beau.
430	
431	ROSALIND	With his mouth full of news.
432	
433	CELIA	Which he will put on us, as pigeons feed their young.
434	
435	ROSALIND	Then shall we be news-crammed.
436	
437	CELIA	All the better; we shall be the more marketable.
438	
439	[Enter LE BEAU]
440	
441	Bon jour, Monsieur Le Beau: what's the news?
442	
443	LE BEAU	Fair princess, you have lost much good sport.
444	
445	CELIA	Sport! of what colour?
446	
447	LE BEAU	What colour, madam! how shall I answer you?
448	
449	ROSALIND	As wit and fortune will.
450	
451	TOUCHSTONE	Or as the Destinies decree.
452	
453	CELIA	Well said: that was laid on with a trowel.
454	
455	TOUCHSTONE	Nay, if I keep not my rank,--
456	
457	ROSALIND	Thou losest thy old smell.
458	
459	LE BEAU	You amaze me, ladies: I would have told you of good
460	wrestling, which you have lost the sight of.
461	
462	ROSALIND	You tell us the manner of the wrestling.
463	
464	LE BEAU	I will tell you the beginning; and, if it please
465	your ladyships, you may see the end; for the best is
466	yet to do; and here, where you are, they are coming
467	to perform it.
468	
469	CELIA	Well, the beginning, that is dead and buried.
470	
471	LE BEAU	There comes an old man and his three sons,--
472	
473	CELIA	I could match this beginning with an old tale.
474	
475	LE BEAU	Three proper young men, of excellent growth and presence.
476	
477	ROSALIND	With bills on their necks, 'Be it known unto all men
478	by these presents.'
479	
480	LE BEAU	The eldest of the three wrestled with Charles, the
481	duke's wrestler; which Charles in a moment threw him
482	and broke three of his ribs, that there is little
483	hope of life in him: so he served the second, and
484	so the third. Yonder they lie; the poor old man,
485	their father, making such pitiful dole over them
486	that all the beholders take his part with weeping.
487	
488	ROSALIND	Alas!
489	
490	TOUCHSTONE	But what is the sport, monsieur, that the ladies
491	have lost?
492	
493	LE BEAU	Why, this that I speak of.
494	
495	TOUCHSTONE	Thus men may grow wiser every day: it is the first
496	time that ever I heard breaking of ribs was sport
497	for ladies.
498	
499	CELIA	Or I, I promise thee.
500	
501	ROSALIND	But is there any else longs to see this broken music
502	in his sides? is there yet another dotes upon
503	rib-breaking? Shall we see this wrestling, cousin?
504	
505	LE BEAU	You must, if you stay here; for here is the place
506	appointed for the wrestling, and they are ready to
507	perform it.
508	
509	CELIA	Yonder, sure, they are coming: let us now stay and see it.
510	
511	[Flourish. Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, ORLANDO,
512	CHARLES, and Attendants]
513	
514	DUKE FREDERICK	Come on: since the youth will not be entreated, his
515	own peril on his forwardness.
516	
517	ROSALIND	Is yonder the man?
518	
519	LE BEAU	Even he, madam.
520	
521	CELIA	Alas, he is too young! yet he looks successfully.
522	
523	DUKE FREDERICK	How now, daughter and cousin! are you crept hither
524	to see the wrestling?
525	
526	ROSALIND	Ay, my liege, so please you give us leave.
527	
528	DUKE FREDERICK	You will take little delight in it, I can tell you;
529	there is such odds in the man. In pity of the
530	challenger's youth I would fain dissuade him, but he
531	will not be entreated. Speak to him, ladies; see if
532	you can move him.
533	
534	CELIA	Call him hither, good Monsieur Le Beau.
535	
536	DUKE FREDERICK	Do so: I'll not be by.
537	
538	LE BEAU	Monsieur the challenger, the princesses call for you.
539	
540	ORLANDO	I attend them with all respect and duty.
541	
542	ROSALIND	Young man, have you challenged Charles the wrestler?
543	
544	ORLANDO	No, fair princess; he is the general challenger: I
545	come but in, as others do, to try with him the
546	strength of my youth.
547	
548	CELIA	Young gentleman, your spirits are too bold for your
549	years. You have seen cruel proof of this man's
550	strength: if you saw yourself with your eyes or
551	knew yourself with your judgment, the fear of your
552	adventure would counsel you to a more equal
553	enterprise. We pray you, for your own sake, to
554	embrace your own safety and give over this attempt.
555	
556	ROSALIND	Do, young sir; your reputation shall not therefore
557	be misprised: we will make it our suit to the duke
558	that the wrestling might not go forward.
559	
560	ORLANDO	I beseech you, punish me not with your hard
561	thoughts; wherein I confess me much guilty, to deny
562	so fair and excellent ladies any thing. But let
563	your fair eyes and gentle wishes go with me to my
564	trial: wherein if I be foiled, there is but one
565	shamed that was never gracious; if killed, but one
566	dead that was willing to be so: I shall do my
567	friends no wrong, for I have none to lament me, the
568	world no injury, for in it I have nothing; only in
569	the world I fill up a place, which may be better
570	supplied when I have made it empty.
571	
572	ROSALIND	The little strength that I have, I would it were with you.
573	
574	CELIA	And mine, to eke out hers.
575	
576	ROSALIND	Fare you well: pray heaven I be deceived in you!
577	
578	CELIA	Your heart's desires be with you!
579	
580	CHARLES	Come, where is this young gallant that is so
581	desirous to lie with his mother earth?
582	
583	ORLANDO	Ready, sir; but his will hath in it a more modest working.
584	
585	DUKE FREDERICK	You shall try but one fall.
586	
587	CHARLES	No, I warrant your grace, you shall not entreat him
588	to a second, that have so mightily persuaded him
589	from a first.
590	
591	ORLANDO	An you mean to mock me after, you should not have
592	mocked me before: but come your ways.
593	
594	ROSALIND	Now Hercules be thy speed, young man!
595	
596	CELIA	I would I were invisible, to catch the strong
597	fellow by the leg.
598	
599	[They wrestle]
600	
601	ROSALIND	O excellent young man!
602	
603	CELIA	If I had a thunderbolt in mine eye, I can tell who
604	should down.
605	
606	[Shout. CHARLES is thrown]
607	
608	DUKE FREDERICK	No more, no more.
609	
610	ORLANDO	Yes, I beseech your grace: I am not yet well breathed.
611	
612	DUKE FREDERICK	How dost thou, Charles?
613	
614	LE BEAU	He cannot speak, my lord.
615	
616	DUKE FREDERICK	Bear him away. What is thy name, young man?
617	
618	ORLANDO	Orlando, my liege; the youngest son of Sir Rowland de Boys.
619	
620	DUKE FREDERICK	I would thou hadst been son to some man else:
621	The world esteem'd thy father honourable,
622	But I did find him still mine enemy:
623	Thou shouldst have better pleased me with this deed,
624	Hadst thou descended from another house.
625	But fare thee well; thou art a gallant youth:
626	I would thou hadst told me of another father.
627	
628	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK, train, and LE BEAU]
629	
630	CELIA	Were I my father, coz, would I do this?
631	
632	ORLANDO	I am more proud to be Sir Rowland's son,
633	His youngest son; and would not change that calling,
634	To be adopted heir to Frederick.
635	
636	ROSALIND	My father loved Sir Rowland as his soul,
637	And all the world was of my father's mind:
638	Had I before known this young man his son,
639	I should have given him tears unto entreaties,
640	Ere he should thus have ventured.
641	
642	CELIA	Gentle cousin,
643	Let us go thank him and encourage him:
644	My father's rough and envious disposition
645	Sticks me at heart. Sir, you have well deserved:
646	If you do keep your promises in love
647	But justly, as you have exceeded all promise,
648	Your mistress shall be happy.
649	
650	ROSALIND	Gentleman,
651	
652	[Giving him a chain from her neck]
653	
654	Wear this for me, one out of suits with fortune,
655	That could give more, but that her hand lacks means.
656	Shall we go, coz?
657	
658	CELIA	                  Ay. Fare you well, fair gentleman.
659	
660	ORLANDO	Can I not say, I thank you? My better parts
661	Are all thrown down, and that which here stands up
662	Is but a quintain, a mere lifeless block.
663	
664	ROSALIND	He calls us back: my pride fell with my fortunes;
665	I'll ask him what he would. Did you call, sir?
666	Sir, you have wrestled well and overthrown
667	More than your enemies.
668	
669	CELIA	Will you go, coz?
670	
671	ROSALIND	Have with you. Fare you well.
672	
673	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]
674	
675	ORLANDO	What passion hangs these weights upon my tongue?
676	I cannot speak to her, yet she urged conference.
677	O poor Orlando, thou art overthrown!
678	Or Charles or something weaker masters thee.
679	
680	[Re-enter LE BEAU]
681	
682	LE BEAU	Good sir, I do in friendship counsel you
683	To leave this place. Albeit you have deserved
684	High commendation, true applause and love,
685	Yet such is now the duke's condition
686	That he misconstrues all that you have done.
687	The duke is humorous; what he is indeed,
688	More suits you to conceive than I to speak of.
689	
690	ORLANDO	I thank you, sir: and, pray you, tell me this:
691	Which of the two was daughter of the duke
692	That here was at the wrestling?
693	
694	LE BEAU	Neither his daughter, if we judge by manners;
695	But yet indeed the lesser is his daughter
696	The other is daughter to the banish'd duke,
697	And here detain'd by her usurping uncle,
698	To keep his daughter company; whose loves
699	Are dearer than the natural bond of sisters.
700	But I can tell you that of late this duke
701	Hath ta'en displeasure 'gainst his gentle niece,
702	Grounded upon no other argument
703	But that the people praise her for her virtues
704	And pity her for her good father's sake;
705	And, on my life, his malice 'gainst the lady
706	Will suddenly break forth. Sir, fare you well:
707	Hereafter, in a better world than this,
708	I shall desire more love and knowledge of you.
709	
710	ORLANDO	I rest much bounden to you: fare you well.
711	
712	[Exit LE BEAU]
713	
714	Thus must I from the smoke into the smother;
715	From tyrant duke unto a tyrant brother:
716	But heavenly Rosalind!
717

729	
730	SCENE III	A room in the palace.
731	
732	
733	[Enter CELIA and ROSALIND]
734	
735	CELIA	Why, cousin! why, Rosalind! Cupid have mercy! not a word?
736	
737	ROSALIND	Not one to throw at a dog.
738	
739	CELIA	No, thy words are too precious to be cast away upon
740	curs; throw some of them at me; come, lame me with reasons.
741	
742	ROSALIND	Then there were two cousins laid up; when the one
743	should be lamed with reasons and the other mad
744	without any.
745	
746	CELIA	But is all this for your father?
747	
748	ROSALIND	No, some of it is for my child's father. O, how
749	full of briers is this working-day world!
750	
751	CELIA	They are but burs, cousin, thrown upon thee in
752	holiday foolery: if we walk not in the trodden
753	paths our very petticoats will catch them.
754	
755	ROSALIND	I could shake them off my coat: these burs are in my heart.
756	
757	CELIA	Hem them away.
758	
759	ROSALIND	I would try, if I could cry 'hem' and have him.
760	
761	CELIA	Come, come, wrestle with thy affections.
762	
763	ROSALIND	O, they take the part of a better wrestler than myself!
764	
765	CELIA	O, a good wish upon you! you will try in time, in
766	despite of a fall. But, turning these jests out of
767	service, let us talk in good earnest: is it
768	possible, on such a sudden, you should fall into so
769	strong a liking with old Sir Rowland's youngest son?
770	
771	ROSALIND	The duke my father loved his father dearly.
772	
773	CELIA	Doth it therefore ensue that you should love his son
774	dearly? By this kind of chase, I should hate him,
775	for my father hated his father dearly; yet I hate
776	not Orlando.
777	
778	ROSALIND	No, faith, hate him not, for my sake.
779	
780	CELIA	Why should I not? doth he not deserve well?
781	
782	ROSALIND	Let me love him for that, and do you love him
783	because I do. Look, here comes the duke.
784	
785	CELIA	With his eyes full of anger.
786	
787	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
788	
789	DUKE FREDERICK	Mistress, dispatch you with your safest haste
790	And get you from our court.
791	
792	ROSALIND	Me, uncle?
793	
794	DUKE FREDERICK	You, cousin
795	Within these ten days if that thou be'st found
796	So near our public court as twenty miles,
797	Thou diest for it.
798	
799	ROSALIND	                  I do beseech your grace,
800	Let me the knowledge of my fault bear with me:
801	If with myself I hold intelligence
802	Or have acquaintance with mine own desires,
803	If that I do not dream or be not frantic,--
804	As I do trust I am not--then, dear uncle,
805	Never so much as in a thought unborn
806	Did I offend your highness.
807	
808	DUKE FREDERICK	Thus do all traitors:
809	If their purgation did consist in words,
810	They are as innocent as grace itself:
811	Let it suffice thee that I trust thee not.
812	
813	ROSALIND	Yet your mistrust cannot make me a traitor:
814	Tell me whereon the likelihood depends.
815	
816	DUKE FREDERICK	Thou art thy father's daughter; there's enough.
817	
818	ROSALIND	So was I when your highness took his dukedom;
819	So was I when your highness banish'd him:
820	Treason is not inherited, my lord;
821	Or, if we did derive it from our friends,
822	What's that to me? my father was no traitor:
823	Then, good my liege, mistake me not so much
824	To think my poverty is treacherous.
825	
826	CELIA	Dear sovereign, hear me speak.
827	
828	DUKE FREDERICK	Ay, Celia; we stay'd her for your sake,
829	Else had she with her father ranged along.
830	
831	CELIA	I did not then entreat to have her stay;
832	It was your pleasure and your own remorse:
833	I was too young that time to value her;
834	But now I know her: if she be a traitor,
835	Why so am I; we still have slept together,
836	Rose at an instant, learn'd, play'd, eat together,
837	And wheresoever we went, like Juno's swans,
838	Still we went coupled and inseparable.
839	
840	DUKE FREDERICK	She is too subtle for thee; and her smoothness,
841	Her very silence and her patience
842	Speak to the people, and they pity her.
843	Thou art a fool: she robs thee of thy name;
844	And thou wilt show more bright and seem more virtuous
845	When she is gone. Then open not thy lips:
846	Firm and irrevocable is my doom
847	Which I have pass'd upon her; she is banish'd.
848	
849	CELIA	Pronounce that sentence then on me, my liege:
850	I cannot live out of her company.
851	
852	DUKE FREDERICK	You are a fool. You, niece, provide yourself:
853	If you outstay the time, upon mine honour,
854	And in the greatness of my word, you die.
855	
856	[Exeunt DUKE FREDERICK and Lords]
857	
858	CELIA	O my poor Rosalind, whither wilt thou go?
859	Wilt thou change fathers? I will give thee mine.
860	I charge thee, be not thou more grieved than I am.
861	
862	ROSALIND	I have more cause.
863	
864	CELIA	                  Thou hast not, cousin;
865	Prithee be cheerful: know'st thou not, the duke
866	Hath banish'd me, his daughter?
867	
868	ROSALIND	That he hath not.
869	
870	CELIA	No, hath not? Rosalind lacks then the love
871	Which teacheth thee that thou and I am one:
872	Shall we be sunder'd? shall we part, sweet girl?
873	No: let my father seek another heir.
874	Therefore devise with me how we may fly,
875	Whither to go and what to bear with us;
876	And do not seek to take your change upon you,
877	To bear your griefs yourself and leave me out;
878	For, by this heaven, now at our sorrows pale,
879	Say what thou canst, I'll go along with thee.
880	
881	ROSALIND	Why, whither shall we go?
882	
883	CELIA	To seek my uncle in the forest of Arden.
884	
885	ROSALIND	Alas, what danger will it be to us,
886	Maids as we are, to travel forth so far!
887	Beauty provoketh thieves sooner than gold.
888	
889	CELIA	I'll put myself in poor and mean attire
890	And with a kind of umber smirch my face;
891	The like do you: so shall we pass along
892	And never stir assailants.
893	
894	ROSALIND	Were it not better,
895	Because that I am more than common tall,
896	That I did suit me all points like a man?
897	A gallant curtle-axe upon my thigh,
898	A boar-spear in my hand; and--in my heart
899	Lie there what hidden woman's fear there will--
900	We'll have a swashing and a martial outside,
901	As many other mannish cowards have
902	That do outface it with their semblances.
903	
904	CELIA	What shall I call thee when thou art a man?
905	
906	ROSALIND	I'll have no worse a name than Jove's own page;
907	And therefore look you call me Ganymede.
908	But what will you be call'd?
909	
910	CELIA	Something that hath a reference to my state
911	No longer Celia, but Aliena.
912	
913	ROSALIND	But, cousin, what if we assay'd to steal
914	The clownish fool out of your father's court?
915	Would he not be a comfort to our travel?
916	
917	CELIA	He'll go along o'er the wide world with me;
918	Leave me alone to woo him. Let's away,
919	And get our jewels and our wealth together,
920	Devise the fittest time and safest way
921	To hide us from pursuit that will be made
922	After my flight. Now go we in content
923	To liberty and not to banishment.

937	SCENE I	The Forest of Arden.
938	
939	
940	[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, and two or three Lords,
941	like foresters]
942	
943	DUKE SENIOR	Now, my co-mates and brothers in exile,
944	Hath not old custom made this life more sweet
945	Than that of painted pomp? Are not these woods
946	More free from peril than the envious court?
947	Here feel we but the penalty of Adam,
948	The seasons' difference, as the icy fang
949	And churlish chiding of the winter's wind,
950	Which, when it bites and blows upon my body,
951	Even till I shrink with cold, I smile and say
952	'This is no flattery: these are counsellors
953	That feelingly persuade me what I am.'
954	Sweet are the uses of adversity,
955	Which, like the toad, ugly and venomous,
956	Wears yet a precious jewel in his head;
957	And this our life exempt from public haunt
958	Finds tongues in trees, books in the running brooks,
959	Sermons in stones and good in every thing.
960	I would not change it.
961	
962	AMIENS	Happy is your grace,
963	That can translate the stubbornness of fortune
964	Into so quiet and so sweet a style.
965	
966	DUKE SENIOR	Come, shall we go and kill us venison?
967	And yet it irks me the poor dappled fools,
968	Being native burghers of this desert city,
969	Should in their own confines with forked heads
970	Have their round haunches gored.
971	
972	First Lord	Indeed, my lord,
973	The melancholy Jaques grieves at that,
974	And, in that kind, swears you do more usurp
975	Than doth your brother that hath banish'd you.
976	To-day my Lord of Amiens and myself
977	Did steal behind him as he lay along
978	Under an oak whose antique root peeps out
979	Upon the brook that brawls along this wood:
980	To the which place a poor sequester'd stag,
981	That from the hunter's aim had ta'en a hurt,
982	Did come to languish, and indeed, my lord,
983	The wretched animal heaved forth such groans
984	That their discharge did stretch his leathern coat
985	Almost to bursting, and the big round tears
986	Coursed one another down his innocent nose
987	In piteous chase; and thus the hairy fool
988	Much marked of the melancholy Jaques,
989	Stood on the extremest verge of the swift brook,
990	Augmenting it with tears.
991	
992	DUKE SENIOR	But what said Jaques?
993	Did he not moralize this spectacle?
994	
995	First Lord	O, yes, into a thousand similes.
996	First, for his weeping into the needless stream;
997	'Poor deer,' quoth he, 'thou makest a testament
998	As worldlings do, giving thy sum of more
999	To that which had too much:' then, being there alone,
1000	Left and abandon'd of his velvet friends,
1001	''Tis right:' quoth he; 'thus misery doth part
1002	The flux of company:' anon a careless herd,
1003	Full of the pasture, jumps along by him
1004	And never stays to greet him; 'Ay' quoth Jaques,
1005	'Sweep on, you fat and greasy citizens;
1006	'Tis just the fashion: wherefore do you look
1007	Upon that poor and broken bankrupt there?'
1008	Thus most invectively he pierceth through
1009	The body of the country, city, court,
1010	Yea, and of this our life, swearing that we
1011	Are mere usurpers, tyrants and what's worse,
1012	To fright the animals and to kill them up
1013	In their assign'd and native dwelling-place.
1014	
1015	DUKE SENIOR	And did you leave him in this contemplation?
1016	
1017	Second Lord	We did, my lord, weeping and commenting
1018	Upon the sobbing deer.
1019	
1020	DUKE SENIOR	Show me the place:
1021	I love to cope him in these sullen fits,
1022	For then he's full of matter.
1023	
1024	First Lord	I'll bring you to him straight.

1041	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, with Lords]
1042	
1043	DUKE FREDERICK	Can it be possible that no man saw them?
1044	It cannot be: some villains of my court
1045	Are of consent and sufferance in this.
1046	
1047	First Lord	I cannot hear of any that did see her.
1048	The ladies, her attendants of her chamber,
1049	Saw her abed, and in the morning early
1050	They found the bed untreasured of their mistress.
1051	
1052	Second Lord	My lord, the roynish clown, at whom so oft
1053	Your grace was wont to laugh, is also missing.
1054	Hisperia, the princess' gentlewoman,
1055	Confesses that she secretly o'erheard
1056	Your daughter and her cousin much commend
1057	The parts and graces of the wrestler
1058	That did but lately foil the sinewy Charles;
1059	And she believes, wherever they are gone,
1060	That youth is surely in their company.
1061	
1062	DUKE FREDERICK	Send to his brother; fetch that gallant hither;
1063	If he be absent, bring his brother to me;
1064	I'll make him find him: do this suddenly,
1065	And let not search and inquisition quail
1066	To bring again these foolish runaways.

1085	ORLANDO	Who's there?
1086	
1087	ADAM	What, my young master? O, my gentle master!
1088	O my sweet master! O you memory
1089	Of old Sir Rowland! why, what make you here?
1090	Why are you virtuous? why do people love you?
1091	And wherefore are you gentle, strong and valiant?
1092	Why would you be so fond to overcome
1093	The bonny priser of the humorous duke?
1094	Your praise is come too swiftly home before you.
1095	Know you not, master, to some kind of men
1096	Their graces serve them but as enemies?
1097	No more do yours: your virtues, gentle master,
1098	Are sanctified and holy traitors to you.
1099	O, what a world is this, when what is comely
1100	Envenoms him that bears it!
1101	
1102	ORLANDO	Why, what's the matter?
1103	
1104	ADAM	O unhappy youth!
1105	Come not within these doors; within this roof
1106	The enemy of all your graces lives:
1107	Your brother--no, no brother; yet the son--
1108	Yet not the son, I will not call him son
1109	Of him I was about to call his father--
1110	Hath heard your praises, and this night he means
1111	To burn the lodging where you use to lie
1112	And you within it: if he fail of that,
1113	He will have other means to cut you off.
1114	I overheard him and his practises.
1115	This is no place; this house is but a butchery:
1116	Abhor it, fear it, do not enter it.
1117	
1118	ORLANDO	Why, whither, Adam, wouldst thou have me go?
1119	
1120	ADAM	No matter whither, so you come not here.
1121	
1122	ORLANDO	What, wouldst thou have me go and beg my food?
1123	Or with a base and boisterous sword enforce
1124	A thievish living on the common road?
1125	This I must do, or know not what to do:
1126	Yet this I will not do, do how I can;
1127	I rather will subject me to the malice
1128	Of a diverted blood and bloody brother.
1129	
1130	ADAM	But do not so. I have five hundred crowns,
1131	The thrifty hire I saved under your father,
1132	Which I did store to be my foster-nurse
1133	When service should in my old limbs lie lame
1134	And unregarded age in corners thrown:
1135	Take that, and He that doth the ravens feed,
1136	Yea, providently caters for the sparrow,
1137	Be comfort to my age! Here is the gold;
1138	And all this I give you. Let me be your servant:
1139	Though I look old, yet I am strong and lusty;
1140	For in my youth I never did apply
1141	Hot and rebellious liquors in my blood,
1142	Nor did not with unbashful forehead woo
1143	The means of weakness and debility;
1144	Therefore my age is as a lusty winter,
1145	Frosty, but kindly: let me go with you;
1146	I'll do the service of a younger man
1147	In all your business and necessities.
1148	
1149	ORLANDO	O good old man, how well in thee appears
1150	The constant service of the antique world,
1151	When service sweat for duty, not for meed!
1152	Thou art not for the fashion of these times,
1153	Where none will sweat but for promotion,
1154	And having that, do choke their service up
1155	Even with the having: it is not so with thee.
1156	But, poor old man, thou prunest a rotten tree,
1157	That cannot so much as a blossom yield
1158	In lieu of all thy pains and husbandry
1159	But come thy ways; well go along together,
1160	And ere we have thy youthful wages spent,
1161	We'll light upon some settled low content.
1162	
1163	ADAM	Master, go on, and I will follow thee,
1164	To the last gasp, with truth and loyalty.
1165	From seventeen years till now almost fourscore
1166	Here lived I, but now live here no more.
1167	At seventeen years many their fortunes seek;
1168	But at fourscore it is too late a week:
1169	Yet fortune cannot recompense me better
1170	Than to die well and not my master's debtor.

1185	
1186	
1187	[Enter ROSALIND for Ganymede, CELIA for Aliena,
1188	and TOUCHSTONE]
1189	
1190	ROSALIND	O Jupiter, how weary are my spirits!
1191	
1192	TOUCHSTONE	I care not for my spirits, if my legs were not weary.
1193	
1194	ROSALIND	I could find in my heart to disgrace my man's
1195	apparel and to cry like a woman; but I must comfort
1196	the weaker vessel, as doublet and hose ought to show
1197	itself courageous to petticoat: therefore courage,
1198	good Aliena!
1199	
1200	CELIA	I pray you, bear with me; I cannot go no further.
1201	
1202	TOUCHSTONE	For my part, I had rather bear with you than bear
1203	you; yet I should bear no cross if I did bear you,
1204	for I think you have no money in your purse.
1205	
1206	ROSALIND	Well, this is the forest of Arden.
1207	
1208	TOUCHSTONE	Ay, now am I in Arden; the more fool I; when I was
1209	at home, I was in a better place: but travellers
1210	must be content.
1211	
1212	ROSALIND	Ay, be so, good Touchstone.
1213	
1214	[Enter CORIN and SILVIUS]
1215	
1216	Look you, who comes here; a young man and an old in
1217	solemn talk.
1218	
1219	CORIN	That is the way to make her scorn you still.
1220	
1221	SILVIUS	O Corin, that thou knew'st how I do love her!
1222	
1223	CORIN	I partly guess; for I have loved ere now.
1224	
1225	SILVIUS	No, Corin, being old, thou canst not guess,
1226	Though in thy youth thou wast as true a lover
1227	As ever sigh'd upon a midnight pillow:
1228	But if thy love were ever like to mine--
1229	As sure I think did never man love so--
1230	How many actions most ridiculous
1231	Hast thou been drawn to by thy fantasy?
1232	
1233	CORIN	Into a thousand that I have forgotten.
1234	
1235	SILVIUS	O, thou didst then ne'er love so heartily!
1236	If thou remember'st not the slightest folly
1237	That ever love did make thee run into,
1238	Thou hast not loved:
1239	Or if thou hast not sat as I do now,
1240	Wearying thy hearer in thy mistress' praise,
1241	Thou hast not loved:
1242	Or if thou hast not broke from company
1243	Abruptly, as my passion now makes me,
1244	Thou hast not loved.
1245	O Phebe, Phebe, Phebe!
1246	
1247	[Exit]
1248	
1249	ROSALIND	Alas, poor shepherd! searching of thy wound,
1250	I have by hard adventure found mine own.
1251	
1252	TOUCHSTONE	And I mine. I remember, when I was in love I broke
1253	my sword upon a stone and bid him take that for
1254	coming a-night to Jane Smile; and I remember the
1255	kissing of her batlet and the cow's dugs that her
1256	pretty chopt hands had milked; and I remember the
1257	wooing of a peascod instead of her, from whom I took
1258	two cods and, giving her them again, said with
1259	weeping tears 'Wear these for my sake.' We that are
1260	true lovers run into strange capers; but as all is
1261	mortal in nature, so is all nature in love mortal in folly.
1262	
1263	ROSALIND	Thou speakest wiser than thou art ware of.
1264	
1265	TOUCHSTONE	Nay, I shall ne'er be ware of mine own wit till I
1266	break my shins against it.
1267	
1268	ROSALIND	Jove, Jove! this shepherd's passion
1269	Is much upon my fashion.
1270	
1271	TOUCHSTONE	And mine; but it grows something stale with me.
1272	
1273	CELIA	I pray you, one of you question yond man
1274	If he for gold will give us any food:
1275	I faint almost to death.
1276	
1277	TOUCHSTONE	Holla, you clown!
1278	
1279	ROSALIND	Peace, fool: he's not thy kinsman.
1280	
1281	CORIN	Who calls?
1282	
1283	TOUCHSTONE	Your betters, sir.
1284	
1285	CORIN	                  Else are they very wretched.
1286	
1287	ROSALIND	Peace, I say. Good even to you, friend.
1288	
1289	CORIN	And to you, gentle sir, and to you all.
1290	
1291	ROSALIND	I prithee, shepherd, if that love or gold
1292	Can in this desert place buy entertainment,
1293	Bring us where we may rest ourselves and feed:
1294	Here's a young maid with travel much oppress'd
1295	And faints for succor.
1296	
1297	CORIN	Fair sir, I pity her
1298	And wish, for her sake more than for mine own,
1299	My fortunes were more able to relieve her;
1300	But I am shepherd to another man
1301	And do not shear the fleeces that I graze:
1302	My master is of churlish disposition
1303	And little recks to find the way to heaven
1304	By doing deeds of hospitality:
1305	Besides, his cote, his flocks and bounds of feed
1306	Are now on sale, and at our sheepcote now,
1307	By reason of his absence, there is nothing
1308	That you will feed on; but what is, come see.
1309	And in my voice most welcome shall you be.
1310	
1311	ROSALIND	What is he that shall buy his flock and pasture?
1312	
1313	CORIN	That young swain that you saw here but erewhile,
1314	That little cares for buying any thing.
1315	
1316	ROSALIND	I pray thee, if it stand with honesty,
1317	Buy thou the cottage, pasture and the flock,
1318	And thou shalt have to pay for it of us.
1319	
1320	CELIA	And we will mend thy wages. I like this place.
1321	And willingly could waste my time in it.
1322	
1323	CORIN	Assuredly the thing is to be sold:
1324	Go with me: if you like upon report
1325	The soil, the profit and this kind of life,
1326	I will your very faithful feeder be
1327	And buy it with your gold right suddenly.

1346	SONG.
1347	AMIENS	Under the greenwood tree
1348	Who loves to lie with me,
1349	And turn his merry note
1350	Unto the sweet bird's throat,
1351	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
1352	Here shall he see No enemy
1353	But winter and rough weather.
1354	
1355	JAQUES	More, more, I prithee, more.
1356	
1357	AMIENS	It will make you melancholy, Monsieur Jaques.
1358	
1359	JAQUES	I thank it. More, I prithee, more. I can suck
1360	melancholy out of a song, as a weasel sucks eggs.
1361	More, I prithee, more.
1362	
1363	AMIENS	My voice is ragged: I know I cannot please you.
1364	
1365	JAQUES	I do not desire you to please me; I do desire you to
1366	sing. Come, more; another stanzo: call you 'em stanzos?
1367	
1368	AMIENS	What you will, Monsieur Jaques.
1369	
1370	JAQUES	Nay, I care not for their names; they owe me
1371	nothing. Will you sing?
1372	
1373	AMIENS	More at your request than to please myself.
1374	
1375	JAQUES	Well then, if ever I thank any man, I'll thank you;
1376	but that they call compliment is like the encounter
1377	of two dog-apes, and when a man thanks me heartily,
1378	methinks I have given him a penny and he renders me
1379	the beggarly thanks. Come, sing; and you that will
1380	not, hold your tongues.
1381	
1382	AMIENS	Well, I'll end the song. Sirs, cover the while; the
1383	duke will drink under this tree. He hath been all
1384	this day to look you.
1385	
1386	JAQUES	And I have been all this day to avoid him. He is
1387	too disputable for my company: I think of as many
1388	matters as he, but I give heaven thanks and make no
1389	boast of them. Come, warble, come.
1390	
1391	SONG.
1392	Who doth ambition shun
1393	
1394	[All together here]
1395	
1396	And loves to live i' the sun,
1397	Seeking the food he eats
1398	And pleased with what he gets,
1399	Come hither, come hither, come hither:
1400	Here shall he see No enemy
1401	But winter and rough weather.
1402	
1403	JAQUES	I'll give you a verse to this note that I made
1404	yesterday in despite of my invention.
1405	
1406	AMIENS	And I'll sing it.
1407	
1408	JAQUES	Thus it goes:--
1409	
1410	If it do come to pass
1411	That any man turn ass,
1412	Leaving his wealth and ease,
1413	A stubborn will to please,
1414	Ducdame, ducdame, ducdame:
1415	Here shall he see
1416	Gross fools as he,
1417	An if he will come to me.
1418	
1419	AMIENS	What's that 'ducdame'?
1420	
1421	JAQUES	'Tis a Greek invocation, to call fools into a
1422	circle. I'll go sleep, if I can; if I cannot, I'll
1423	rail against all the first-born of Egypt.
1424	
1425	AMIENS	And I'll go seek the duke: his banquet is prepared.

1445	Here lie I down, and measure out my grave. Farewell,
1446	kind master.
1447	
1448	ORLANDO	Why, how now, Adam! no greater heart in thee? Live
1449	a little; comfort a little; cheer thyself a little.
1450	If this uncouth forest yield any thing savage, I
1451	will either be food for it or bring it for food to
1452	thee. Thy conceit is nearer death than thy powers.
1453	For my sake be comfortable; hold death awhile at
1454	the arm's end: I will here be with thee presently;
1455	and if I bring thee not something to eat, I will
1456	give thee leave to die: but if thou diest before I
1457	come, thou art a mocker of my labour. Well said!
1458	thou lookest cheerly, and I'll be with thee quickly.
1459	Yet thou liest in the bleak air: come, I will bear
1460	thee to some shelter; and thou shalt not die for
1461	lack of a dinner, if there live any thing in this

1483	For I can no where find him like a man.
1484	
1485	First Lord	My lord, he is but even now gone hence:
1486	Here was he merry, hearing of a song.
1487	
1488	DUKE SENIOR	If he, compact of jars, grow musical,
1489	We shall have shortly discord in the spheres.
1490	Go, seek him: tell him I would speak with him.
1491	
1492	[Enter JAQUES]
1493	
1494	First Lord	He saves my labour by his own approach.
1495	
1496	DUKE SENIOR	Why, how now, monsieur! what a life is this,
1497	That your poor friends must woo your company?
1498	What, you look merrily!
1499	
1500	JAQUES	A fool, a fool! I met a fool i' the forest,
1501	A motley fool; a miserable world!
1502	As I do live by food, I met a fool
1503	Who laid him down and bask'd him in the sun,
1504	And rail'd on Lady Fortune in good terms,
1505	In good set terms and yet a motley fool.
1506	'Good morrow, fool,' quoth I. 'No, sir,' quoth he,
1507	'Call me not fool till heaven hath sent me fortune:'
1508	And then he drew a dial from his poke,
1509	And, looking on it with lack-lustre eye,
1510	Says very wisely, 'It is ten o'clock:
1511	Thus we may see,' quoth he, 'how the world wags:
1512	'Tis but an hour ago since it was nine,
1513	And after one hour more 'twill be eleven;
1514	And so, from hour to hour, we ripe and ripe,
1515	And then, from hour to hour, we rot and rot;
1516	And thereby hangs a tale.' When I did hear
1517	The motley fool thus moral on the time,
1518	My lungs began to crow like chanticleer,
1519	That fools should be so deep-contemplative,
1520	And I did laugh sans intermission
1521	An hour by his dial. O noble fool!
1522	A worthy fool! Motley's the only wear.
1523	
1524	DUKE SENIOR	What fool is this?
1525	
1526	JAQUES	O worthy fool! One that hath been a courtier,
1527	And says, if ladies be but young and fair,
1528	They have the gift to know it: and in his brain,
1529	Which is as dry as the remainder biscuit
1530	After a voyage, he hath strange places cramm'd
1531	With observation, the which he vents
1532	In mangled forms. O that I were a fool!
1533	I am ambitious for a motley coat.
1534	
1535	DUKE SENIOR	Thou shalt have one.
1536	
1537	JAQUES	It is my only suit;
1538	Provided that you weed your better judgments
1539	Of all opinion that grows rank in them
1540	That I am wise. I must have liberty
1541	Withal, as large a charter as the wind,
1542	To blow on whom I please; for so fools have;
1543	And they that are most galled with my folly,
1544	They most must laugh. And why, sir, must they so?
1545	The 'why' is plain as way to parish church:
1546	He that a fool doth very wisely hit
1547	Doth very foolishly, although he smart,
1548	Not to seem senseless of the bob: if not,
1549	The wise man's folly is anatomized
1550	Even by the squandering glances of the fool.
1551	Invest me in my motley; give me leave
1552	To speak my mind, and I will through and through
1553	Cleanse the foul body of the infected world,
1554	If they will patiently receive my medicine.
1555	
1556	DUKE SENIOR	Fie on thee! I can tell what thou wouldst do.
1557	
1558	JAQUES	What, for a counter, would I do but good?
1559	
1560	DUKE SENIOR	Most mischievous foul sin, in chiding sin:
1561	For thou thyself hast been a libertine,
1562	As sensual as the brutish sting itself;
1563	And all the embossed sores and headed evils,
1564	That thou with licence of free foot hast caught,
1565	Wouldst thou disgorge into the general world.
1566	
1567	JAQUES	Why, who cries out on pride,
1568	That can therein tax any private party?
1569	Doth it not flow as hugely as the sea,
1570	Till that the weary very means do ebb?
1571	What woman in the city do I name,
1572	When that I say the city-woman bears
1573	The cost of princes on unworthy shoulders?
1574	Who can come in and say that I mean her,
1575	When such a one as she such is her neighbour?
1576	Or what is he of basest function
1577	That says his bravery is not of my cost,
1578	Thinking that I mean him, but therein suits
1579	His folly to the mettle of my speech?
1580	There then; how then? what then? Let me see wherein
1581	My tongue hath wrong'd him: if it do him right,
1582	Then he hath wrong'd himself; if he be free,
1583	Why then my taxing like a wild-goose flies,
1584	Unclaim'd of any man. But who comes here?
1585	
1586	[Enter ORLANDO, with his sword drawn]
1587	
1588	ORLANDO	Forbear, and eat no more.
1589	
1590	JAQUES	Why, I have eat none yet.
1591	
1592	ORLANDO	Nor shalt not, till necessity be served.
1593	
1594	JAQUES	Of what kind should this cock come of?
1595	
1596	DUKE SENIOR	Art thou thus bolden'd, man, by thy distress,
1597	Or else a rude despiser of good manners,
1598	That in civility thou seem'st so empty?
1599	
1600	ORLANDO	You touch'd my vein at first: the thorny point
1601	Of bare distress hath ta'en from me the show
1602	Of smooth civility: yet am I inland bred
1603	And know some nurture. But forbear, I say:
1604	He dies that touches any of this fruit
1605	Till I and my affairs are answered.
1606	
1607	JAQUES	An you will not be answered with reason, I must die.
1608	
1609	DUKE SENIOR	What would you have? Your gentleness shall force
1610	More than your force move us to gentleness.
1611	
1612	ORLANDO	I almost die for food; and let me have it.
1613	
1614	DUKE SENIOR	Sit down and feed, and welcome to our table.
1615	
1616	ORLANDO	Speak you so gently? Pardon me, I pray you:
1617	I thought that all things had been savage here;
1618	And therefore put I on the countenance
1619	Of stern commandment. But whate'er you are
1620	That in this desert inaccessible,
1621	Under the shade of melancholy boughs,
1622	Lose and neglect the creeping hours of time
1623	If ever you have look'd on better days,
1624	If ever been where bells have knoll'd to church,
1625	If ever sat at any good man's feast,
1626	If ever from your eyelids wiped a tear
1627	And know what 'tis to pity and be pitied,
1628	Let gentleness my strong enforcement be:
1629	In the which hope I blush, and hide my sword.
1630	
1631	DUKE SENIOR	True is it that we have seen better days,
1632	And have with holy bell been knoll'd to church
1633	And sat at good men's feasts and wiped our eyes
1634	Of drops that sacred pity hath engender'd:
1635	And therefore sit you down in gentleness
1636	And take upon command what help we have
1637	That to your wanting may be minister'd.
1638	
1639	ORLANDO	Then but forbear your food a little while,
1640	Whiles, like a doe, I go to find my fawn
1641	And give it food. There is an old poor man,
1642	Who after me hath many a weary step
1643	Limp'd in pure love: till he be first sufficed,
1644	Oppress'd with two weak evils, age and hunger,
1645	I will not touch a bit.
1646	
1647	DUKE SENIOR	Go find him out,
1648	And we will nothing waste till you return.
1649	
1650	ORLANDO	I thank ye; and be blest for your good comfort!
1651	
1652	[Exit]
1653	
1654	DUKE SENIOR	Thou seest we are not all alone unhappy:
1655	This wide and universal theatre
1656	Presents more woeful pageants than the scene
1657	Wherein we play in.
1658	
1659	JAQUES	All the world's a stage,
1660	And all the men and women merely players:
1661	They have their exits and their entrances;
1662	And one man in his time plays many parts,
1663	His acts being seven ages. At first the infant,
1664	Mewling and puking in the nurse's arms.
1665	And then the whining school-boy, with his satchel
1666	And shining morning face, creeping like snail
1667	Unwillingly to school. And then the lover,
1668	Sighing like furnace, with a woeful ballad
1669	Made to his mistress' eyebrow. Then a soldier,
1670	Full of strange oaths and bearded like the pard,
1671	Jealous in honour, sudden and quick in quarrel,
1672	Seeking the bubble reputation
1673	Even in the cannon's mouth. And then the justice,
1674	In fair round belly with good capon lined,
1675	With eyes severe and beard of formal cut,
1676	Full of wise saws and modern instances;
1677	And so he plays his part. The sixth age shifts
1678	Into the lean and slipper'd pantaloon,
1679	With spectacles on nose and pouch on side,
1680	His youthful hose, well saved, a world too wide
1681	For his shrunk shank; and his big manly voice,
1682	Turning again toward childish treble, pipes
1683	And whistles in his sound. Last scene of all,
1684	That ends this strange eventful history,
1685	Is second childishness and mere oblivion,
1686	Sans teeth, sans eyes, sans taste, sans everything.
1687	
1688	[Re-enter ORLANDO, with ADAM]
1689	
1690	DUKE SENIOR	Welcome. Set down your venerable burthen,
1691	And let him feed.
1692	
1693	ORLANDO	I thank you most for him.
1694	
1695	ADAM	So had you need:
1696	I scarce can speak to thank you for myself.
1697	
1698	DUKE SENIOR	Welcome; fall to: I will not trouble you
1699	As yet, to question you about your fortunes.
1700	Give us some music; and, good cousin, sing.
1701	
1702	SONG.
1703	AMIENS	Blow, blow, thou winter wind.
1704	Thou art not so unkind
1705	As man's ingratitude;
1706	Thy tooth is not so keen,
1707	Because thou art not seen,
1708	Although thy breath be rude.
1709	Heigh-ho! sing, heigh-ho! unto the green holly:
1710	Most friendship is feigning, most loving mere folly:
1711	Then, heigh-ho, the holly!
1712	This life is most jolly.
1713	Freeze, freeze, thou bitter sky,
1714	That dost not bite so nigh
1715	As benefits forgot:
1716	Though thou the waters warp,
1717	Thy sting is not so sharp
1718	As friend remember'd not.
1719	Heigh-ho! sing, &c.
1720	
1721	DUKE SENIOR	If that you were the good Sir Rowland's son,
1722	As you have whisper'd faithfully you were,
1723	And as mine eye doth his effigies witness
1724	Most truly limn'd and living in your face,
1725	Be truly welcome hither: I am the duke
1726	That loved your father: the residue of your fortune,
1727	Go to my cave and tell me. Good old man,
1728	Thou art right welcome as thy master is.
1729	Support him by the arm. Give me your hand,
1730	And let me all your fortunes understand.

1745	
1746	
1747	[Enter DUKE FREDERICK, Lords, and OLIVER]
1748	
1749	DUKE FREDERICK	Not see him since? Sir, sir, that cannot be:
1750	But were I not the better part made mercy,
1751	I should not seek an absent argument
1752	Of my revenge, thou present. But look to it:
1753	Find out thy brother, wheresoe'er he is;
1754	Seek him with candle; bring him dead or living
1755	Within this twelvemonth, or turn thou no more
1756	To seek a living in our territory.
1757	Thy lands and all things that thou dost call thine
1758	Worth seizure do we seize into our hands,
1759	Till thou canst quit thee by thy brothers mouth
1760	Of what we think against thee.
1761	
1762	OLIVER	O that your highness knew my heart in this!
1763	I never loved my brother in my life.
1764	
1765	DUKE FREDERICK	More villain thou. Well, push him out of doors;
1766	And let my officers of such a nature
1767	Make an extent upon his house and lands:
1768	Do this expediently and turn him going.

1781	
1782	SCENE II	The forest.
1783	
1784	
1785	[Enter ORLANDO, with a paper]
1786	
1787	ORLANDO	Hang there, my verse, in witness of my love:
1788	And thou, thrice-crowned queen of night, survey
1789	With thy chaste eye, from thy pale sphere above,
1790	Thy huntress' name that my full life doth sway.
1791	O Rosalind! these trees shall be my books
1792	And in their barks my thoughts I'll character;
1793	That every eye which in this forest looks
1794	Shall see thy virtue witness'd every where.
1795	Run, run, Orlando; carve on every tree
1796	The fair, the chaste and unexpressive she.
1797	
1798	[Exit]
1799	
1800	[Enter CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]
1801	
1802	CORIN	And how like you this shepherd's life, Master Touchstone?
1803	
1804	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, shepherd, in respect of itself, it is a good
1805	life, but in respect that it is a shepherd's life,
1806	it is naught. In respect that it is solitary, I
1807	like it very well; but in respect that it is
1808	private, it is a very vile life. Now, in respect it
1809	is in the fields, it pleaseth me well; but in
1810	respect it is not in the court, it is tedious. As
1811	is it a spare life, look you, it fits my humour well;
1812	but as there is no more plenty in it, it goes much
1813	against my stomach. Hast any philosophy in thee, shepherd?
1814	
1815	CORIN	No more but that I know the more one sickens the
1816	worse at ease he is; and that he that wants money,
1817	means and content is without three good friends;
1818	that the property of rain is to wet and fire to
1819	burn; that good pasture makes fat sheep, and that a
1820	great cause of the night is lack of the sun; that
1821	he that hath learned no wit by nature nor art may
1822	complain of good breeding or comes of a very dull kindred.
1823	
1824	TOUCHSTONE	Such a one is a natural philosopher. Wast ever in
1825	court, shepherd?
1826	
1827	CORIN	No, truly.
1828	
1829	TOUCHSTONE	Then thou art damned.
1830	
1831	CORIN	Nay, I hope.
1832	
1833	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, thou art damned like an ill-roasted egg, all
1834	on one side.
1835	
1836	CORIN	For not being at court? Your reason.
1837	
1838	TOUCHSTONE	Why, if thou never wast at court, thou never sawest
1839	good manners; if thou never sawest good manners,
1840	then thy manners must be wicked; and wickedness is
1841	sin, and sin is damnation. Thou art in a parlous
1842	state, shepherd.
1843	
1844	CORIN	Not a whit, Touchstone: those that are good manners
1845	at the court are as ridiculous in the country as the
1846	behavior of the country is most mockable at the
1847	court. You told me you salute not at the court, but
1848	you kiss your hands: that courtesy would be
1849	uncleanly, if courtiers were shepherds.
1850	
1851	TOUCHSTONE	Instance, briefly; come, instance.
1852	
1853	CORIN	Why, we are still handling our ewes, and their
1854	fells, you know, are greasy.
1855	
1856	TOUCHSTONE	Why, do not your courtier's hands sweat? and is not
1857	the grease of a mutton as wholesome as the sweat of
1858	a man? Shallow, shallow. A better instance, I say; come.
1859	
1860	CORIN	Besides, our hands are hard.
1861	
1862	TOUCHSTONE	Your lips will feel them the sooner. Shallow again.
1863	A more sounder instance, come.
1864	
1865	CORIN	And they are often tarred over with the surgery of
1866	our sheep: and would you have us kiss tar? The
1867	courtier's hands are perfumed with civet.
1868	
1869	TOUCHSTONE	Most shallow man! thou worms-meat, in respect of a
1870	good piece of flesh indeed! Learn of the wise, and
1871	perpend: civet is of a baser birth than tar, the
1872	very uncleanly flux of a cat. Mend the instance, shepherd.
1873	
1874	CORIN	You have too courtly a wit for me: I'll rest.
1875	
1876	TOUCHSTONE	Wilt thou rest damned? God help thee, shallow man!
1877	God make incision in thee! thou art raw.
1878	
1879	CORIN	Sir, I am a true labourer: I earn that I eat, get
1880	that I wear, owe no man hate, envy no man's
1881	happiness, glad of other men's good, content with my
1882	harm, and the greatest of my pride is to see my ewes
1883	graze and my lambs suck.
1884	
1885	TOUCHSTONE	That is another simple sin in you, to bring the ewes
1886	and the rams together and to offer to get your
1887	living by the copulation of cattle; to be bawd to a
1888	bell-wether, and to betray a she-lamb of a
1889	twelvemonth to a crooked-pated, old, cuckoldly ram,
1890	out of all reasonable match. If thou beest not
1891	damned for this, the devil himself will have no
1892	shepherds; I cannot see else how thou shouldst
1893	'scape.
1894	
1895	CORIN	Here comes young Master Ganymede, my new mistress's brother.
1896	
1897	[Enter ROSALIND, with a paper, reading]
1898	
1899	ROSALIND	     From the east to western Ind,
1900	No jewel is like Rosalind.
1901	Her worth, being mounted on the wind,
1902	Through all the world bears Rosalind.
1903	All the pictures fairest lined
1904	Are but black to Rosalind.
1905	Let no fair be kept in mind
1906	But the fair of Rosalind.
1907	
1908	TOUCHSTONE	I'll rhyme you so eight years together, dinners and
1909	suppers and sleeping-hours excepted: it is the
1910	right butter-women's rank to market.
1911	
1912	ROSALIND	Out, fool!
1913	
1914	TOUCHSTONE	For a taste:
1915	If a hart do lack a hind,
1916	Let him seek out Rosalind.
1917	If the cat will after kind,
1918	So be sure will Rosalind.
1919	Winter garments must be lined,
1920	So must slender Rosalind.
1921	They that reap must sheaf and bind;
1922	Then to cart with Rosalind.
1923	Sweetest nut hath sourest rind,
1924	Such a nut is Rosalind.
1925	He that sweetest rose will find
1926	Must find love's prick and Rosalind.
1927	This is the very false gallop of verses: why do you
1928	infect yourself with them?
1929	
1930	ROSALIND	Peace, you dull fool! I found them on a tree.
1931	
1932	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, the tree yields bad fruit.
1933	
1934	ROSALIND	I'll graff it with you, and then I shall graff it
1935	with a medlar: then it will be the earliest fruit
1936	i' the country; for you'll be rotten ere you be half
1937	ripe, and that's the right virtue of the medlar.
1938	
1939	TOUCHSTONE	You have said; but whether wisely or no, let the
1940	forest judge.
1941	
1942	[Enter CELIA, with a writing]
1943	
1944	ROSALIND	Peace! Here comes my sister, reading: stand aside.
1945	
1946	CELIA	[Reads]
1947	
1948	Why should this a desert be?
1949	For it is unpeopled? No:
1950	Tongues I'll hang on every tree,
1951	That shall civil sayings show:
1952	Some, how brief the life of man
1953	Runs his erring pilgrimage,
1954	That the stretching of a span
1955	Buckles in his sum of age;
1956	Some, of violated vows
1957	'Twixt the souls of friend and friend:
1958	But upon the fairest boughs,
1959	Or at every sentence end,
1960	Will I Rosalinda write,
1961	Teaching all that read to know
1962	The quintessence of every sprite
1963	Heaven would in little show.
1964	Therefore Heaven Nature charged
1965	That one body should be fill'd
1966	With all graces wide-enlarged:
1967	Nature presently distill'd
1968	Helen's cheek, but not her heart,
1969	Cleopatra's majesty,
1970	Atalanta's better part,
1971	Sad Lucretia's modesty.
1972	Thus Rosalind of many parts
1973	By heavenly synod was devised,
1974	Of many faces, eyes and hearts,
1975	To have the touches dearest prized.
1976	Heaven would that she these gifts should have,
1977	And I to live and die her slave.
1978	
1979	ROSALIND	O most gentle pulpiter! what tedious homily of love
1980	have you wearied your parishioners withal, and never
1981	cried 'Have patience, good people!'
1982	
1983	CELIA	How now! back, friends! Shepherd, go off a little.
1984	Go with him, sirrah.
1985	
1986	TOUCHSTONE	Come, shepherd, let us make an honourable retreat;
1987	though not with bag and baggage, yet with scrip and scrippage.
1988	
1989	[Exeunt CORIN and TOUCHSTONE]
1990	
1991	CELIA	Didst thou hear these verses?
1992	
1993	ROSALIND	O, yes, I heard them all, and more too; for some of
1994	them had in them more feet than the verses would bear.
1995	
1996	CELIA	That's no matter: the feet might bear the verses.
1997	
1998	ROSALIND	Ay, but the feet were lame and could not bear
1999	themselves without the verse and therefore stood
2000	lamely in the verse.
2001	
2002	CELIA	But didst thou hear without wondering how thy name
2003	should be hanged and carved upon these trees?
2004	
2005	ROSALIND	I was seven of the nine days out of the wonder
2006	before you came; for look here what I found on a
2007	palm-tree. I was never so be-rhymed since
2008	Pythagoras' time, that I was an Irish rat, which I
2009	can hardly remember.
2010	
2011	CELIA	Trow you who hath done this?
2012	
2013	ROSALIND	Is it a man?
2014	
2015	CELIA	And a chain, that you once wore, about his neck.
2016	Change you colour?
2017	
2018	ROSALIND	I prithee, who?
2019	
2020	CELIA	O Lord, Lord! it is a hard matter for friends to
2021	meet; but mountains may be removed with earthquakes
2022	and so encounter.
2023	
2024	ROSALIND	Nay, but who is it?
2025	
2026	CELIA	Is it possible?
2027	
2028	ROSALIND	Nay, I prithee now with most petitionary vehemence,
2029	tell me who it is.
2030	
2031	CELIA	O wonderful, wonderful, and most wonderful
2032	wonderful! and yet again wonderful, and after that,
2033	out of all hooping!
2034	
2035	ROSALIND	Good my complexion! dost thou think, though I am
2036	caparisoned like a man, I have a doublet and hose in
2037	my disposition? One inch of delay more is a
2038	South-sea of discovery; I prithee, tell me who is it
2039	quickly, and speak apace. I would thou couldst
2040	stammer, that thou mightst pour this concealed man
2041	out of thy mouth, as wine comes out of a narrow-
2042	mouthed bottle, either too much at once, or none at
2043	all. I prithee, take the cork out of thy mouth that
2044	may drink thy tidings.
2045	
2046	CELIA	So you may put a man in your belly.
2047	
2048	ROSALIND	Is he of God's making? What manner of man? Is his
2049	head worth a hat, or his chin worth a beard?
2050	
2051	CELIA	Nay, he hath but a little beard.
2052	
2053	ROSALIND	Why, God will send more, if the man will be
2054	thankful: let me stay the growth of his beard, if
2055	thou delay me not the knowledge of his chin.
2056	
2057	CELIA	It is young Orlando, that tripped up the wrestler's
2058	heels and your heart both in an instant.
2059	
2060	ROSALIND	Nay, but the devil take mocking: speak, sad brow and
2061	true maid.
2062	
2063	CELIA	I' faith, coz, 'tis he.
2064	
2065	ROSALIND	Orlando?
2066	
2067	CELIA	Orlando.
2068	
2069	ROSALIND	Alas the day! what shall I do with my doublet and
2070	hose? What did he when thou sawest him? What said
2071	he? How looked he? Wherein went he? What makes
2072	him here? Did he ask for me? Where remains he?
2073	How parted he with thee? and when shalt thou see
2074	him again? Answer me in one word.
2075	
2076	CELIA	You must borrow me Gargantua's mouth first: 'tis a
2077	word too great for any mouth of this age's size. To
2078	say ay and no to these particulars is more than to
2079	answer in a catechism.
2080	
2081	ROSALIND	But doth he know that I am in this forest and in
2082	man's apparel? Looks he as freshly as he did the
2083	day he wrestled?
2084	
2085	CELIA	It is as easy to count atomies as to resolve the
2086	propositions of a lover; but take a taste of my
2087	finding him, and relish it with good observance.
2088	I found him under a tree, like a dropped acorn.
2089	
2090	ROSALIND	It may well be called Jove's tree, when it drops
2091	forth such fruit.
2092	
2093	CELIA	Give me audience, good madam.
2094	
2095	ROSALIND	Proceed.
2096	
2097	CELIA	There lay he, stretched along, like a wounded knight.
2098	
2099	ROSALIND	Though it be pity to see such a sight, it well
2100	becomes the ground.
2101	
2102	CELIA	Cry 'holla' to thy tongue, I prithee; it curvets
2103	unseasonably. He was furnished like a hunter.
2104	
2105	ROSALIND	O, ominous! he comes to kill my heart.
2106	
2107	CELIA	I would sing my song without a burden: thou bringest
2108	me out of tune.
2109	
2110	ROSALIND	Do you not know I am a woman? when I think, I must
2111	speak. Sweet, say on.
2112	
2113	CELIA	You bring me out. Soft! comes he not here?
2114	
2115	[Enter ORLANDO and JAQUES]
2116	
2117	ROSALIND	'Tis he: slink by, and note him.
2118	
2119	JAQUES	I thank you for your company; but, good faith, I had
2120	as lief have been myself alone.
2121	
2122	ORLANDO	And so had I; but yet, for fashion sake, I thank you
2123	too for your society.
2124	
2125	JAQUES	God be wi' you: let's meet as little as we can.
2126	
2127	ORLANDO	I do desire we may be better strangers.
2128	
2129	JAQUES	I pray you, mar no more trees with writing
2130	love-songs in their barks.
2131	
2132	ORLANDO	I pray you, mar no more of my verses with reading
2133	them ill-favouredly.
2134	
2135	JAQUES	Rosalind is your love's name?
2136	
2137	ORLANDO	Yes, just.
2138	
2139	JAQUES	I do not like her name.
2140	
2141	ORLANDO	There was no thought of pleasing you when she was
2142	christened.
2143	
2144	JAQUES	What stature is she of?
2145	
2146	ORLANDO	Just as high as my heart.
2147	
2148	JAQUES	You are full of pretty answers. Have you not been
2149	acquainted with goldsmiths' wives, and conned them
2150	out of rings?
2151	
2152	ORLANDO	Not so; but I answer you right painted cloth, from
2153	whence you have studied your questions.
2154	
2155	JAQUES	You have a nimble wit: I think 'twas made of
2156	Atalanta's heels. Will you sit down with me? and
2157	we two will rail against our mistress the world and
2158	all our misery.
2159	
2160	ORLANDO	I will chide no breather in the world but myself,
2161	against whom I know most faults.
2162	
2163	JAQUES	The worst fault you have is to be in love.
2164	
2165	ORLANDO	'Tis a fault I will not change for your best virtue.
2166	I am weary of you.
2167	
2168	JAQUES	By my troth, I was seeking for a fool when I found
2169	you.
2170	
2171	ORLANDO	He is drowned in the brook: look but in, and you
2172	shall see him.
2173	
2174	JAQUES	There I shall see mine own figure.
2175	
2176	ORLANDO	Which I take to be either a fool or a cipher.
2177	
2178	JAQUES	I'll tarry no longer with you: farewell, good
2179	Signior Love.
2180	
2181	ORLANDO	I am glad of your departure: adieu, good Monsieur
2182	Melancholy.
2183	
2184	[Exit JAQUES]
2185	
2186	ROSALIND	[Aside to CELIA]  I will speak to him, like a saucy
2187	lackey and under that habit play the knave with him.
2188	Do you hear, forester?
2189	
2190	ORLANDO	Very well: what would you?
2191	
2192	ROSALIND	I pray you, what is't o'clock?
2193	
2194	ORLANDO	You should ask me what time o' day: there's no clock
2195	in the forest.
2196	
2197	ROSALIND	Then there is no true lover in the forest; else
2198	sighing every minute and groaning every hour would
2199	detect the lazy foot of Time as well as a clock.
2200	
2201	ORLANDO	And why not the swift foot of Time? had not that
2202	been as proper?
2203	
2204	ROSALIND	By no means, sir: Time travels in divers paces with
2205	divers persons. I'll tell you who Time ambles
2206	withal, who Time trots withal, who Time gallops
2207	withal and who he stands still withal.
2208	
2209	ORLANDO	I prithee, who doth he trot withal?
2210	
2211	ROSALIND	Marry, he trots hard with a young maid between the
2212	contract of her marriage and the day it is
2213	solemnized: if the interim be but a se'nnight,
2214	Time's pace is so hard that it seems the length of
2215	seven year.
2216	
2217	ORLANDO	Who ambles Time withal?
2218	
2219	ROSALIND	With a priest that lacks Latin and a rich man that
2220	hath not the gout, for the one sleeps easily because
2221	he cannot study, and the other lives merrily because
2222	he feels no pain, the one lacking the burden of lean
2223	and wasteful learning, the other knowing no burden
2224	of heavy tedious penury; these Time ambles withal.
2225	
2226	ORLANDO	Who doth he gallop withal?
2227	
2228	ROSALIND	With a thief to the gallows, for though he go as
2229	softly as foot can fall, he thinks himself too soon there.
2230	
2231	ORLANDO	Who stays it still withal?
2232	
2233	ROSALIND	With lawyers in the vacation, for they sleep between
2234	term and term and then they perceive not how Time moves.
2235	
2236	ORLANDO	Where dwell you, pretty youth?
2237	
2238	ROSALIND	With this shepherdess, my sister; here in the
2239	skirts of the forest, like fringe upon a petticoat.
2240	
2241	ORLANDO	Are you native of this place?
2242	
2243	ROSALIND	As the cony that you see dwell where she is kindled.
2244	
2245	ORLANDO	Your accent is something finer than you could
2246	purchase in so removed a dwelling.
2247	
2248	ROSALIND	I have been told so of many: but indeed an old
2249	religious uncle of mine taught me to speak, who was
2250	in his youth an inland man; one that knew courtship
2251	too well, for there he fell in love. I have heard
2252	him read many lectures against it, and I thank God
2253	I am not a woman, to be touched with so many
2254	giddy offences as he hath generally taxed their
2255	whole sex withal.
2256	
2257	ORLANDO	Can you remember any of the principal evils that he
2258	laid to the charge of women?
2259	
2260	ROSALIND	There were none principal; they were all like one
2261	another as half-pence are, every one fault seeming
2262	monstrous till his fellow fault came to match it.
2263	
2264	ORLANDO	I prithee, recount some of them.
2265	
2266	ROSALIND	No, I will not cast away my physic but on those that
2267	are sick. There is a man haunts the forest, that
2268	abuses our young plants with carving 'Rosalind' on
2269	their barks; hangs odes upon hawthorns and elegies
2270	on brambles, all, forsooth, deifying the name of
2271	Rosalind: if I could meet that fancy-monger I would
2272	give him some good counsel, for he seems to have the
2273	quotidian of love upon him.
2274	
2275	ORLANDO	I am he that is so love-shaked: I pray you tell me
2276	your remedy.
2277	
2278	ROSALIND	There is none of my uncle's marks upon you: he
2279	taught me how to know a man in love; in which cage
2280	of rushes I am sure you are not prisoner.
2281	
2282	ORLANDO	What were his marks?
2283	
2284	ROSALIND	A lean cheek, which you have not, a blue eye and
2285	sunken, which you have not, an unquestionable
2286	spirit, which you have not, a beard neglected,
2287	which you have not; but I pardon you for that, for
2288	simply your having in beard is a younger brother's
2289	revenue: then your hose should be ungartered, your
2290	bonnet unbanded, your sleeve unbuttoned, your shoe
2291	untied and every thing about you demonstrating a
2292	careless desolation; but you are no such man; you
2293	are rather point-device in your accoutrements as
2294	loving yourself than seeming the lover of any other.
2295	
2296	ORLANDO	Fair youth, I would I could make thee believe I love.
2297	
2298	ROSALIND	Me believe it! you may as soon make her that you
2299	love believe it; which, I warrant, she is apter to
2300	do than to confess she does: that is one of the
2301	points in the which women still give the lie to
2302	their consciences. But, in good sooth, are you he
2303	that hangs the verses on the trees, wherein Rosalind
2304	is so admired?
2305	
2306	ORLANDO	I swear to thee, youth, by the white hand of
2307	Rosalind, I am that he, that unfortunate he.
2308	
2309	ROSALIND	But are you so much in love as your rhymes speak?
2310	
2311	ORLANDO	Neither rhyme nor reason can express how much.
2312	
2313	ROSALIND	Love is merely a madness, and, I tell you, deserves
2314	as well a dark house and a whip as madmen do: and
2315	the reason why they are not so punished and cured
2316	is, that the lunacy is so ordinary that the whippers
2317	are in love too. Yet I profess curing it by counsel.
2318	
2319	ORLANDO	Did you ever cure any so?
2320	
2321	ROSALIND	Yes, one, and in this manner. He was to imagine me
2322	his love, his mistress; and I set him every day to
2323	woo me: at which time would I, being but a moonish
2324	youth, grieve, be effeminate, changeable, longing
2325	and liking, proud, fantastical, apish, shallow,
2326	inconstant, full of tears, full of smiles, for every
2327	passion something and for no passion truly any
2328	thing, as boys and women are for the most part
2329	cattle of this colour; would now like him, now loathe
2330	him; then entertain him, then forswear him; now weep
2331	for him, then spit at him; that I drave my suitor
2332	from his mad humour of love to a living humour of
2333	madness; which was, to forswear the full stream of
2334	the world, and to live in a nook merely monastic.
2335	And thus I cured him; and this way will I take upon
2336	me to wash your liver as clean as a sound sheep's
2337	heart, that there shall not be one spot of love in't.
2338	
2339	ORLANDO	I would not be cured, youth.
2340	
2341	ROSALIND	I would cure you, if you would but call me Rosalind
2342	and come every day to my cote and woo me.
2343	
2344	ORLANDO	Now, by the faith of my love, I will: tell me
2345	where it is.
2346	
2347	ROSALIND	Go with me to it and I'll show it you and by the way
2348	you shall tell me where in the forest you live.
2349	Will you go?
2350	
2351	ORLANDO	With all my heart, good youth.
2352	
2353	ROSALIND	Nay you must call me Rosalind. Come, sister, will you go?
2354	
2355	[Exeunt]

2361	
2362	
2363	ACT III
2364	
2365	
2366	
2367	SCENE III	The forest.
2368	
2369	
2370	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY; JAQUES behind]
2371	
2372	TOUCHSTONE	Come apace, good Audrey: I will fetch up your
2373	goats, Audrey. And how, Audrey? am I the man yet?
2374	doth my simple feature content you?
2375	
2376	AUDREY	Your features! Lord warrant us! what features!
2377	
2378	TOUCHSTONE	I am here with thee and thy goats, as the most
2379	capricious poet, honest Ovid, was among the Goths.
2380	
2381	JAQUES	[Aside]  O knowledge ill-inhabited, worse than Jove
2382	in a thatched house!
2383	
2384	TOUCHSTONE	When a man's verses cannot be understood, nor a
2385	man's good wit seconded with the forward child
2386	Understanding, it strikes a man more dead than a
2387	great reckoning in a little room. Truly, I would
2388	the gods had made thee poetical.
2389	
2390	AUDREY	I do not know what 'poetical' is: is it honest in
2391	deed and word? is it a true thing?
2392	
2393	TOUCHSTONE	No, truly; for the truest poetry is the most
2394	feigning; and lovers are given to poetry, and what
2395	they swear in poetry may be said as lovers they do feign.
2396	
2397	AUDREY	Do you wish then that the gods had made me poetical?
2398	
2399	TOUCHSTONE	I do, truly; for thou swearest to me thou art
2400	honest: now, if thou wert a poet, I might have some
2401	hope thou didst feign.
2402	
2403	AUDREY	Would you not have me honest?
2404	
2405	TOUCHSTONE	No, truly, unless thou wert hard-favoured; for
2406	honesty coupled to beauty is to have honey a sauce to sugar.
2407	
2408	JAQUES	[Aside]  A material fool!
2409	
2410	AUDREY	 Well, I am not fair; and therefore I pray the gods
2411	make me honest.
2412	
2413	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, and to cast away honesty upon a foul slut
2414	were to put good meat into an unclean dish.
2415	
2416	AUDREY	I am not a slut, though I thank the gods I am foul.
2417	
2418	TOUCHSTONE	Well, praised be the gods for thy foulness!
2419	sluttishness may come hereafter. But be it as it may
2420	be, I will marry thee, and to that end I have been
2421	with Sir Oliver Martext, the vicar of the next
2422	village, who hath promised to meet me in this place
2423	of the forest and to couple us.
2424	
2425	JAQUES	[Aside]  I would fain see this meeting.
2426	
2427	AUDREY	Well, the gods give us joy!
2428	
2429	TOUCHSTONE	Amen. A man may, if he were of a fearful heart,
2430	stagger in this attempt; for here we have no temple
2431	but the wood, no assembly but horn-beasts. But what
2432	though? Courage! As horns are odious, they are
2433	necessary. It is said, 'many a man knows no end of
2434	his goods:' right; many a man has good horns, and
2435	knows no end of them. Well, that is the dowry of
2436	his wife; 'tis none of his own getting. Horns?
2437	Even so. Poor men alone? No, no; the noblest deer
2438	hath them as huge as the rascal. Is the single man
2439	therefore blessed? No: as a walled town is more
2440	worthier than a village, so is the forehead of a
2441	married man more honourable than the bare brow of a
2442	bachelor; and by how much defence is better than no
2443	skill, by so much is a horn more precious than to
2444	want. Here comes Sir Oliver.
2445	
2446	[Enter SIR OLIVER MARTEXT]
2447	
2448	Sir Oliver Martext, you are well met: will you
2449	dispatch us here under this tree, or shall we go
2450	with you to your chapel?
2451	
2452	SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Is there none here to give the woman?
2453	
2454	TOUCHSTONE	I will not take her on gift of any man.
2455	
2456	SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	Truly, she must be given, or the marriage is not lawful.
2457	
2458	JAQUES	[Advancing]
2459	
2460	Proceed, proceed	I'll give her.
2461	
2462	TOUCHSTONE	Good even, good Master What-ye-call't: how do you,
2463	sir? You are very well met: God 'ild you for your
2464	last company: I am very glad to see you: even a
2465	toy in hand here, sir: nay, pray be covered.
2466	
2467	JAQUES	Will you be married, motley?
2468	
2469	TOUCHSTONE	As the ox hath his bow, sir, the horse his curb and
2470	the falcon her bells, so man hath his desires; and
2471	as pigeons bill, so wedlock would be nibbling.
2472	
2473	JAQUES	And will you, being a man of your breeding, be
2474	married under a bush like a beggar? Get you to
2475	church, and have a good priest that can tell you
2476	what marriage is: this fellow will but join you
2477	together as they join wainscot; then one of you will
2478	prove a shrunk panel and, like green timber, warp, warp.
2479	
2480	TOUCHSTONE	[Aside]  I am not in the mind but I were better to be
2481	married of him than of another: for he is not like
2482	to marry me well; and not being well married, it
2483	will be a good excuse for me hereafter to leave my wife.
2484	
2485	JAQUES	Go thou with me, and let me counsel thee.
2486	
2487	TOUCHSTONE	'Come, sweet Audrey:
2488	We must be married, or we must live in bawdry.
2489	Farewell, good Master Oliver: not,--
2490	O sweet Oliver,
2491	O brave Oliver,
2492	Leave me not behind thee: but,--
2493	Wind away,
2494	Begone, I say,
2495	I will not to wedding with thee.
2496	
2497	[Exeunt JAQUES, TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
2498	
2499	SIR OLIVER MARTEXT	'Tis no matter: ne'er a fantastical knave of them
2500	all shall flout me out of my calling.
2501	
2502	[Exit]

2510	ACT III
2511	
2512	
2513	
2514	SCENE IV	The forest.
2515	
2516	
2517	[Enter ROSALIND and CELIA]
2518	
2519	ROSALIND	Never talk to me; I will weep.
2520	
2521	CELIA	Do, I prithee; but yet have the grace to consider
2522	that tears do not become a man.
2523	
2524	ROSALIND	But have I not cause to weep?
2525	
2526	CELIA	As good cause as one would desire; therefore weep.
2527	
2528	ROSALIND	His very hair is of the dissembling colour.
2529	
2530	CELIA	Something browner than Judas's marry, his kisses are
2531	Judas's own children.
2532	
2533	ROSALIND	I' faith, his hair is of a good colour.
2534	
2535	CELIA	An excellent colour: your chestnut was ever the only colour.
2536	
2537	ROSALIND	And his kissing is as full of sanctity as the touch
2538	of holy bread.
2539	
2540	CELIA	He hath bought a pair of cast lips of Diana: a nun
2541	of winter's sisterhood kisses not more religiously;
2542	the very ice of chastity is in them.
2543	
2544	ROSALIND	But why did he swear he would come this morning, and
2545	comes not?
2546	
2547	CELIA	Nay, certainly, there is no truth in him.
2548	
2549	ROSALIND	Do you think so?
2550	
2551	CELIA	Yes; I think he is not a pick-purse nor a
2552	horse-stealer, but for his verity in love, I do
2553	think him as concave as a covered goblet or a
2554	worm-eaten nut.
2555	
2556	ROSALIND	Not true in love?
2557	
2558	CELIA	Yes, when he is in; but I think he is not in.
2559	
2560	ROSALIND	You have heard him swear downright he was.
2561	
2562	CELIA	'Was' is not 'is:' besides, the oath of a lover is
2563	no stronger than the word of a tapster; they are
2564	both the confirmer of false reckonings. He attends
2565	here in the forest on the duke your father.
2566	
2567	ROSALIND	I met the duke yesterday and had much question with
2568	him: he asked me of what parentage I was; I told
2569	him, of as good as he; so he laughed and let me go.
2570	But what talk we of fathers, when there is such a
2571	man as Orlando?
2572	
2573	CELIA	O, that's a brave man! he writes brave verses,
2574	speaks brave words, swears brave oaths and breaks
2575	them bravely, quite traverse, athwart the heart of
2576	his lover; as a puisny tilter, that spurs his horse
2577	but on one side, breaks his staff like a noble
2578	goose: but all's brave that youth mounts and folly
2579	guides. Who comes here?
2580	
2581	[Enter CORIN]
2582	
2583	CORIN	Mistress and master, you have oft inquired
2584	After the shepherd that complain'd of love,
2585	Who you saw sitting by me on the turf,
2586	Praising the proud disdainful shepherdess
2587	That was his mistress.
2588	
2589	CELIA	Well, and what of him?
2590	
2591	CORIN	If you will see a pageant truly play'd,
2592	Between the pale complexion of true love
2593	And the red glow of scorn and proud disdain,
2594	Go hence a little and I shall conduct you,
2595	If you will mark it.
2596	
2597	ROSALIND	O, come, let us remove:
2598	The sight of lovers feedeth those in love.
2599	Bring us to this sight, and you shall say
2600	I'll prove a busy actor in their play.
2601

2614	SCENE V	Another part of the forest.
2615	
2616	
2617	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
2618	
2619	SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, do not scorn me; do not, Phebe;
2620	Say that you love me not, but say not so
2621	In bitterness. The common executioner,
2622	Whose heart the accustom'd sight of death makes hard,
2623	Falls not the axe upon the humbled neck
2624	But first begs pardon: will you sterner be
2625	Than he that dies and lives by bloody drops?
2626	
2627	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and CORIN, behind]
2628	
2629	PHEBE	I would not be thy executioner:
2630	I fly thee, for I would not injure thee.
2631	Thou tell'st me there is murder in mine eye:
2632	'Tis pretty, sure, and very probable,
2633	That eyes, that are the frail'st and softest things,
2634	Who shut their coward gates on atomies,
2635	Should be call'd tyrants, butchers, murderers!
2636	Now I do frown on thee with all my heart;
2637	And if mine eyes can wound, now let them kill thee:
2638	Now counterfeit to swoon; why now fall down;
2639	Or if thou canst not, O, for shame, for shame,
2640	Lie not, to say mine eyes are murderers!
2641	Now show the wound mine eye hath made in thee:
2642	Scratch thee but with a pin, and there remains
2643	Some scar of it; lean but upon a rush,
2644	The cicatrice and capable impressure
2645	Thy palm some moment keeps; but now mine eyes,
2646	Which I have darted at thee, hurt thee not,
2647	Nor, I am sure, there is no force in eyes
2648	That can do hurt.
2649	
2650	SILVIUS	                  O dear Phebe,
2651	If ever,--as that ever may be near,--
2652	You meet in some fresh cheek the power of fancy,
2653	Then shall you know the wounds invisible
2654	That love's keen arrows make.
2655	
2656	PHEBE	But till that time
2657	Come not thou near me: and when that time comes,
2658	Afflict me with thy mocks, pity me not;
2659	As till that time I shall not pity thee.
2660	
2661	ROSALIND	And why, I pray you? Who might be your mother,
2662	That you insult, exult, and all at once,
2663	Over the wretched? What though you have no beauty,--
2664	As, by my faith, I see no more in you
2665	Than without candle may go dark to bed--
2666	Must you be therefore proud and pitiless?
2667	Why, what means this? Why do you look on me?
2668	I see no more in you than in the ordinary
2669	Of nature's sale-work. 'Od's my little life,
2670	I think she means to tangle my eyes too!
2671	No, faith, proud mistress, hope not after it:
2672	'Tis not your inky brows, your black silk hair,
2673	Your bugle eyeballs, nor your cheek of cream,
2674	That can entame my spirits to your worship.
2675	You foolish shepherd, wherefore do you follow her,
2676	Like foggy south puffing with wind and rain?
2677	You are a thousand times a properer man
2678	Than she a woman: 'tis such fools as you
2679	That makes the world full of ill-favour'd children:
2680	'Tis not her glass, but you, that flatters her;
2681	And out of you she sees herself more proper
2682	Than any of her lineaments can show her.
2683	But, mistress, know yourself: down on your knees,
2684	And thank heaven, fasting, for a good man's love:
2685	For I must tell you friendly in your ear,
2686	Sell when you can: you are not for all markets:
2687	Cry the man mercy; love him; take his offer:
2688	Foul is most foul, being foul to be a scoffer.
2689	So take her to thee, shepherd: fare you well.
2690	
2691	PHEBE	Sweet youth, I pray you, chide a year together:
2692	I had rather hear you chide than this man woo.
2693	
2694	ROSALIND	He's fallen in love with your foulness and she'll
2695	fall in love with my anger. If it be so, as fast as
2696	she answers thee with frowning looks, I'll sauce her
2697	with bitter words. Why look you so upon me?
2698	
2699	PHEBE	For no ill will I bear you.
2700	
2701	ROSALIND	I pray you, do not fall in love with me,
2702	For I am falser than vows made in wine:
2703	Besides, I like you not. If you will know my house,
2704	'Tis at the tuft of olives here hard by.
2705	Will you go, sister? Shepherd, ply her hard.
2706	Come, sister. Shepherdess, look on him better,
2707	And be not proud: though all the world could see,
2708	None could be so abused in sight as he.
2709	Come, to our flock.
2710	
2711	[Exeunt ROSALIND, CELIA and CORIN]
2712	
2713	PHEBE	Dead Shepherd, now I find thy saw of might,
2714	'Who ever loved that loved not at first sight?'
2715	
2716	SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe,--
2717	
2718	PHEBE	                  Ha, what say'st thou, Silvius?
2719	
2720	SILVIUS	Sweet Phebe, pity me.
2721	
2722	PHEBE	Why, I am sorry for thee, gentle Silvius.
2723	
2724	SILVIUS	Wherever sorrow is, relief would be:
2725	If you do sorrow at my grief in love,
2726	By giving love your sorrow and my grief
2727	Were both extermined.
2728	
2729	PHEBE	Thou hast my love: is not that neighbourly?
2730	
2731	SILVIUS	I would have you.
2732	
2733	PHEBE	                  Why, that were covetousness.
2734	Silvius, the time was that I hated thee,
2735	And yet it is not that I bear thee love;
2736	But since that thou canst talk of love so well,
2737	Thy company, which erst was irksome to me,
2738	I will endure, and I'll employ thee too:
2739	But do not look for further recompense
2740	Than thine own gladness that thou art employ'd.
2741	
2742	SILVIUS	So holy and so perfect is my love,
2743	And I in such a poverty of grace,
2744	That I shall think it a most plenteous crop
2745	To glean the broken ears after the man
2746	That the main harvest reaps: loose now and then
2747	A scatter'd smile, and that I'll live upon.
2748	
2749	PHEBE	Know'st now the youth that spoke to me erewhile?
2750	
2751	SILVIUS	Not very well, but I have met him oft;
2752	And he hath bought the cottage and the bounds
2753	That the old carlot once was master of.
2754	
2755	PHEBE	Think not I love him, though I ask for him:
2756	'Tis but a peevish boy; yet he talks well;
2757	But what care I for words? yet words do well
2758	When he that speaks them pleases those that hear.
2759	It is a pretty youth: not very pretty:
2760	But, sure, he's proud, and yet his pride becomes him:
2761	He'll make a proper man: the best thing in him
2762	Is his complexion; and faster than his tongue
2763	Did make offence his eye did heal it up.
2764	He is not very tall; yet for his years he's tall:
2765	His leg is but so so; and yet 'tis well:
2766	There was a pretty redness in his lip,
2767	A little riper and more lusty red
2768	Than that mix'd in his cheek; 'twas just the difference
2769	Between the constant red and mingled damask.
2770	There be some women, Silvius, had they mark'd him
2771	In parcels as I did, would have gone near
2772	To fall in love with him; but, for my part,
2773	I love him not nor hate him not; and yet
2774	I have more cause to hate him than to love him:
2775	For what had he to do to chide at me?
2776	He said mine eyes were black and my hair black:
2777	And, now I am remember'd, scorn'd at me:
2778	I marvel why I answer'd not again:
2779	But that's all one; omittance is no quittance.
2780	I'll write to him a very taunting letter,
2781	And thou shalt bear it: wilt thou, Silvius?
2782	
2783	SILVIUS	Phebe, with all my heart.
2784	
2785	PHEBE	I'll write it straight;
2786	The matter's in my head and in my heart:
2787	I will be bitter with him and passing short.
2788	Go with me, Silvius.
2789	
2790	[Exeunt]

2798	ACT IV
2799	
2800	
2801	
2802	SCENE I	The forest.
2803	
2804	
2805	[Enter ROSALIND, CELIA, and JAQUES]
2806	
2807	JAQUES	I prithee, pretty youth, let me be better acquainted
2808	with thee.
2809	
2810	ROSALIND	They say you are a melancholy fellow.
2811	
2812	JAQUES	I am so; I do love it better than laughing.
2813	
2814	ROSALIND	Those that are in extremity of either are abominable
2815	fellows and betray themselves to every modern
2816	censure worse than drunkards.
2817	
2818	JAQUES	Why, 'tis good to be sad and say nothing.
2819	
2820	ROSALIND	Why then, 'tis good to be a post.
2821	
2822	JAQUES	I have neither the scholar's melancholy, which is
2823	emulation, nor the musician's, which is fantastical,
2824	nor the courtier's, which is proud, nor the
2825	soldier's, which is ambitious, nor the lawyer's,
2826	which is politic, nor the lady's, which is nice, nor
2827	the lover's, which is all these: but it is a
2828	melancholy of mine own, compounded of many simples,
2829	extracted from many objects, and indeed the sundry's
2830	contemplation of my travels, in which my often
2831	rumination wraps me m a most humorous sadness.
2832	
2833	ROSALIND	A traveller! By my faith, you have great reason to
2834	be sad: I fear you have sold your own lands to see
2835	other men's; then, to have seen much and to have
2836	nothing, is to have rich eyes and poor hands.
2837	
2838	JAQUES	Yes, I have gained my experience.
2839	
2840	ROSALIND	And your experience makes you sad: I had rather have
2841	a fool to make me merry than experience to make me
2842	sad; and to travel for it too!
2843	
2844	[Enter ORLANDO]
2845	
2846	ORLANDO	Good day and happiness, dear Rosalind!
2847	
2848	JAQUES	Nay, then, God be wi' you, an you talk in blank verse.
2849	
2850	[Exit]
2851	
2852	ROSALIND	Farewell, Monsieur Traveller: look you lisp and
2853	wear strange suits, disable all the benefits of your
2854	own country, be out of love with your nativity and
2855	almost chide God for making you that countenance you
2856	are, or I will scarce think you have swam in a
2857	gondola. Why, how now, Orlando! where have you been
2858	all this while? You a lover! An you serve me such
2859	another trick, never come in my sight more.
2860	
2861	ORLANDO	My fair Rosalind, I come within an hour of my promise.
2862	
2863	ROSALIND	Break an hour's promise in love! He that will
2864	divide a minute into a thousand parts and break but
2865	a part of the thousandth part of a minute in the
2866	affairs of love, it may be said of him that Cupid
2867	hath clapped him o' the shoulder, but I'll warrant
2868	him heart-whole.
2869	
2870	ORLANDO	Pardon me, dear Rosalind.
2871	
2872	ROSALIND	Nay, an you be so tardy, come no more in my sight: I
2873	had as lief be wooed of a snail.
2874	
2875	ORLANDO	Of a snail?
2876	
2877	ROSALIND	Ay, of a snail; for though he comes slowly, he
2878	carries his house on his head; a better jointure,
2879	I think, than you make a woman: besides he brings
2880	his destiny with him.
2881	
2882	ORLANDO	What's that?
2883	
2884	ROSALIND	Why, horns, which such as you are fain to be
2885	beholding to your wives for: but he comes armed in
2886	his fortune and prevents the slander of his wife.
2887	
2888	ORLANDO	Virtue is no horn-maker; and my Rosalind is virtuous.
2889	
2890	ROSALIND	And I am your Rosalind.
2891	
2892	CELIA	It pleases him to call you so; but he hath a
2893	Rosalind of a better leer than you.
2894	
2895	ROSALIND	Come, woo me, woo me, for now I am in a holiday
2896	humour and like enough to consent. What would you
2897	say to me now, an I were your very very Rosalind?
2898	
2899	ORLANDO	I would kiss before I spoke.
2900	
2901	ROSALIND	Nay, you were better speak first, and when you were
2902	gravelled for lack of matter, you might take
2903	occasion to kiss. Very good orators, when they are
2904	out, they will spit; and for lovers lacking--God
2905	warn us!--matter, the cleanliest shift is to kiss.
2906	
2907	ORLANDO	How if the kiss be denied?
2908	
2909	ROSALIND	Then she puts you to entreaty, and there begins new matter.
2910	
2911	ORLANDO	Who could be out, being before his beloved mistress?
2912	
2913	ROSALIND	Marry, that should you, if I were your mistress, or
2914	I should think my honesty ranker than my wit.
2915	
2916	ORLANDO	What, of my suit?
2917	
2918	ROSALIND	Not out of your apparel, and yet out of your suit.
2919	Am not I your Rosalind?
2920	
2921	ORLANDO	I take some joy to say you are, because I would be
2922	talking of her.
2923	
2924	ROSALIND	Well in her person I say I will not have you.
2925	
2926	ORLANDO	Then in mine own person I die.
2927	
2928	ROSALIND	No, faith, die by attorney. The poor world is
2929	almost six thousand years old, and in all this time
2930	there was not any man died in his own person,
2931	videlicit, in a love-cause. Troilus had his brains
2932	dashed out with a Grecian club; yet he did what he
2933	could to die before, and he is one of the patterns
2934	of love. Leander, he would have lived many a fair
2935	year, though Hero had turned nun, if it had not been
2936	for a hot midsummer night; for, good youth, he went
2937	but forth to wash him in the Hellespont and being
2938	taken with the cramp was drowned and the foolish
2939	coroners of that age found it was 'Hero of Sestos.'
2940	But these are all lies: men have died from time to
2941	time and worms have eaten them, but not for love.
2942	
2943	ORLANDO	I would not have my right Rosalind of this mind,
2944	for, I protest, her frown might kill me.
2945	
2946	ROSALIND	By this hand, it will not kill a fly. But come, now
2947	I will be your Rosalind in a more coming-on
2948	disposition, and ask me what you will. I will grant
2949	it.
2950	
2951	ORLANDO	Then love me, Rosalind.
2952	
2953	ROSALIND	Yes, faith, will I, Fridays and Saturdays and all.
2954	
2955	ORLANDO	And wilt thou have me?
2956	
2957	ROSALIND	Ay, and twenty such.
2958	
2959	ORLANDO	What sayest thou?
2960	
2961	ROSALIND	Are you not good?
2962	
2963	ORLANDO	I hope so.
2964	
2965	ROSALIND	Why then, can one desire too much of a good thing?
2966	Come, sister, you shall be the priest and marry us.
2967	Give me your hand, Orlando. What do you say, sister?
2968	
2969	ORLANDO	Pray thee, marry us.
2970	
2971	CELIA	I cannot say the words.
2972	
2973	ROSALIND	You must begin, 'Will you, Orlando--'
2974	
2975	CELIA	Go to. Will you, Orlando, have to wife this Rosalind?
2976	
2977	ORLANDO	I will.
2978	
2979	ROSALIND	Ay, but when?
2980	
2981	ORLANDO	Why now; as fast as she can marry us.
2982	
2983	ROSALIND	Then you must say 'I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.'
2984	
2985	ORLANDO	I take thee, Rosalind, for wife.
2986	
2987	ROSALIND	I might ask you for your commission; but I do take
2988	thee, Orlando, for my husband: there's a girl goes
2989	before the priest; and certainly a woman's thought
2990	runs before her actions.
2991	
2992	ORLANDO	So do all thoughts; they are winged.
2993	
2994	ROSALIND	Now tell me how long you would have her after you
2995	have possessed her.
2996	
2997	ORLANDO	For ever and a day.
2998	
2999	ROSALIND	Say 'a day,' without the 'ever.' No, no, Orlando;
3000	men are April when they woo, December when they wed:
3001	maids are May when they are maids, but the sky
3002	changes when they are wives. I will be more jealous
3003	of thee than a Barbary cock-pigeon over his hen,
3004	more clamorous than a parrot against rain, more
3005	new-fangled than an ape, more giddy in my desires
3006	than a monkey: I will weep for nothing, like Diana
3007	in the fountain, and I will do that when you are
3008	disposed to be merry; I will laugh like a hyen, and
3009	that when thou art inclined to sleep.
3010	
3011	ORLANDO	But will my Rosalind do so?
3012	
3013	ROSALIND	By my life, she will do as I do.
3014	
3015	ORLANDO	O, but she is wise.
3016	
3017	ROSALIND	Or else she could not have the wit to do this: the
3018	wiser, the waywarder: make the doors upon a woman's
3019	wit and it will out at the casement; shut that and
3020	'twill out at the key-hole; stop that, 'twill fly
3021	with the smoke out at the chimney.
3022	
3023	ORLANDO	A man that had a wife with such a wit, he might say
3024	'Wit, whither wilt?'
3025	
3026	ROSALIND	Nay, you might keep that cheque for it till you met
3027	your wife's wit going to your neighbour's bed.
3028	
3029	ORLANDO	And what wit could wit have to excuse that?
3030	
3031	ROSALIND	Marry, to say she came to seek you there. You shall
3032	never take her without her answer, unless you take
3033	her without her tongue. O, that woman that cannot
3034	make her fault her husband's occasion, let her
3035	never nurse her child herself, for she will breed
3036	it like a fool!
3037	
3038	ORLANDO	For these two hours, Rosalind, I will leave thee.
3039	
3040	ROSALIND	Alas! dear love, I cannot lack thee two hours.
3041	
3042	ORLANDO	I must attend the duke at dinner: by two o'clock I
3043	will be with thee again.
3044	
3045	ROSALIND	Ay, go your ways, go your ways; I knew what you
3046	would prove: my friends told me as much, and I
3047	thought no less: that flattering tongue of yours
3048	won me: 'tis but one cast away, and so, come,
3049	death! Two o'clock is your hour?
3050	
3051	ORLANDO	Ay, sweet Rosalind.
3052	
3053	ROSALIND	By my troth, and in good earnest, and so God mend
3054	me, and by all pretty oaths that are not dangerous,
3055	if you break one jot of your promise or come one
3056	minute behind your hour, I will think you the most
3057	pathetical break-promise and the most hollow lover
3058	and the most unworthy of her you call Rosalind that
3059	may be chosen out of the gross band of the
3060	unfaithful: therefore beware my censure and keep
3061	your promise.
3062	
3063	ORLANDO	With no less religion than if thou wert indeed my
3064	Rosalind: so adieu.
3065	
3066	ROSALIND	Well, Time is the old justice that examines all such
3067	offenders, and let Time try: adieu.
3068	
3069	[Exit ORLANDO]
3070	
3071	CELIA	You have simply misused our sex in your love-prate:
3072	we must have your doublet and hose plucked over your
3073	head, and show the world what the bird hath done to
3074	her own nest.
3075	
3076	ROSALIND	O coz, coz, coz, my pretty little coz, that thou
3077	didst know how many fathom deep I am in love! But
3078	it cannot be sounded: my affection hath an unknown
3079	bottom, like the bay of Portugal.
3080	
3081	CELIA	Or rather, bottomless, that as fast as you pour
3082	affection in, it runs out.
3083	
3084	ROSALIND	No, that same wicked bastard of Venus that was begot
3085	of thought, conceived of spleen and born of madness,
3086	that blind rascally boy that abuses every one's eyes
3087	because his own are out, let him be judge how deep I
3088	am in love. I'll tell thee, Aliena, I cannot be out
3089	of the sight of Orlando: I'll go find a shadow and
3090	sigh till he come.
3091	
3092	CELIA	And I'll sleep.

3110	
3111	JAQUES	Which is he that killed the deer?
3112	
3113	A Lord	Sir, it was I.
3114	
3115	JAQUES	Let's present him to the duke, like a Roman
3116	conqueror; and it would do well to set the deer's
3117	horns upon his head, for a branch of victory. Have
3118	you no song, forester, for this purpose?
3119	
3120	Forester	Yes, sir.
3121	
3122	JAQUES	Sing it: 'tis no matter how it be in tune, so it
3123	make noise enough.
3124	
3125	SONG.
3126	Forester	What shall he have that kill'd the deer?
3127	His leather skin and horns to wear.
3128	Then sing him home;
3129	
3130	[The rest shall bear this burden]
3131	
3132	Take thou no scorn to wear the horn;
3133	It was a crest ere thou wast born:
3134	Thy father's father wore it,
3135	And thy father bore it:
3136	The horn, the horn, the lusty horn
3137	Is not a thing to laugh to scorn.

3155	
3156	ROSALIND	How say you now? Is it not past two o'clock? and
3157	here much Orlando!
3158	
3159	CELIA	I warrant you, with pure love and troubled brain, he
3160	hath ta'en his bow and arrows and is gone forth to
3161	sleep. Look, who comes here.
3162	
3163	[Enter SILVIUS]
3164	
3165	SILVIUS	My errand is to you, fair youth;
3166	My gentle Phebe bid me give you this:
3167	I know not the contents; but, as I guess
3168	By the stern brow and waspish action
3169	Which she did use as she was writing of it,
3170	It bears an angry tenor: pardon me:
3171	I am but as a guiltless messenger.
3172	
3173	ROSALIND	Patience herself would startle at this letter
3174	And play the swaggerer; bear this, bear all:
3175	She says I am not fair, that I lack manners;
3176	She calls me proud, and that she could not love me,
3177	Were man as rare as phoenix. 'Od's my will!
3178	Her love is not the hare that I do hunt:
3179	Why writes she so to me? Well, shepherd, well,
3180	This is a letter of your own device.
3181	
3182	SILVIUS	No, I protest, I know not the contents:
3183	Phebe did write it.
3184	
3185	ROSALIND	Come, come, you are a fool
3186	And turn'd into the extremity of love.
3187	I saw her hand: she has a leathern hand.
3188	A freestone-colour'd hand; I verily did think
3189	That her old gloves were on, but 'twas her hands:
3190	She has a huswife's hand; but that's no matter:
3191	I say she never did invent this letter;
3192	This is a man's invention and his hand.
3193	
3194	SILVIUS	Sure, it is hers.
3195	
3196	ROSALIND	Why, 'tis a boisterous and a cruel style.
3197	A style for-challengers; why, she defies me,
3198	Like Turk to Christian: women's gentle brain
3199	Could not drop forth such giant-rude invention
3200	Such Ethiope words, blacker in their effect
3201	Than in their countenance. Will you hear the letter?
3202	
3203	SILVIUS	So please you, for I never heard it yet;
3204	Yet heard too much of Phebe's cruelty.
3205	
3206	ROSALIND	She Phebes me: mark how the tyrant writes.
3207	
3208	[Reads]
3209	
3210	Art thou god to shepherd turn'd,
3211	That a maiden's heart hath burn'd?
3212	Can a woman rail thus?
3213	
3214	SILVIUS	Call you this railing?
3215	
3216	ROSALIND	[Reads]
3217	
3218	Why, thy godhead laid apart,
3219	Warr'st thou with a woman's heart?
3220	Did you ever hear such railing?
3221	Whiles the eye of man did woo me,
3222	That could do no vengeance to me.
3223	Meaning me a beast.
3224	If the scorn of your bright eyne
3225	Have power to raise such love in mine,
3226	Alack, in me what strange effect
3227	Would they work in mild aspect!
3228	Whiles you chid me, I did love;
3229	How then might your prayers move!
3230	He that brings this love to thee
3231	Little knows this love in me:
3232	And by him seal up thy mind;
3233	Whether that thy youth and kind
3234	Will the faithful offer take
3235	Of me and all that I can make;
3236	Or else by him my love deny,
3237	And then I'll study how to die.
3238	
3239	SILVIUS	Call you this chiding?
3240	
3241	CELIA	Alas, poor shepherd!
3242	
3243	ROSALIND	Do you pity him? no, he deserves no pity. Wilt
3244	thou love such a woman? What, to make thee an
3245	instrument and play false strains upon thee! not to
3246	be endured! Well, go your way to her, for I see
3247	love hath made thee a tame snake, and say this to
3248	her: that if she love me, I charge her to love
3249	thee; if she will not, I will never have her unless
3250	thou entreat for her. If you be a true lover,
3251	hence, and not a word; for here comes more company.
3252	
3253	[Exit SILVIUS]
3254	
3255	[Enter OLIVER]
3256	
3257	OLIVER	Good morrow, fair ones: pray you, if you know,
3258	Where in the purlieus of this forest stands
3259	A sheep-cote fenced about with olive trees?
3260	
3261	CELIA	West of this place, down in the neighbour bottom:
3262	The rank of osiers by the murmuring stream
3263	Left on your right hand brings you to the place.
3264	But at this hour the house doth keep itself;
3265	There's none within.
3266	
3267	OLIVER	If that an eye may profit by a tongue,
3268	Then should I know you by description;
3269	Such garments and such years: 'The boy is fair,
3270	Of female favour, and bestows himself
3271	Like a ripe sister: the woman low
3272	And browner than her brother.' Are not you
3273	The owner of the house I did inquire for?
3274	
3275	CELIA	It is no boast, being ask'd, to say we are.
3276	
3277	OLIVER	Orlando doth commend him to you both,
3278	And to that youth he calls his Rosalind
3279	He sends this bloody napkin. Are you he?
3280	
3281	ROSALIND	I am: what must we understand by this?
3282	
3283	OLIVER	Some of my shame; if you will know of me
3284	What man I am, and how, and why, and where
3285	This handkercher was stain'd.
3286	
3287	CELIA	I pray you, tell it.
3288	
3289	OLIVER	When last the young Orlando parted from you
3290	He left a promise to return again
3291	Within an hour, and pacing through the forest,
3292	Chewing the food of sweet and bitter fancy,
3293	Lo, what befell! he threw his eye aside,
3294	And mark what object did present itself:
3295	Under an oak, whose boughs were moss'd with age
3296	And high top bald with dry antiquity,
3297	A wretched ragged man, o'ergrown with hair,
3298	Lay sleeping on his back: about his neck
3299	A green and gilded snake had wreathed itself,
3300	Who with her head nimble in threats approach'd
3301	The opening of his mouth; but suddenly,
3302	Seeing Orlando, it unlink'd itself,
3303	And with indented glides did slip away
3304	Into a bush: under which bush's shade
3305	A lioness, with udders all drawn dry,
3306	Lay couching, head on ground, with catlike watch,
3307	When that the sleeping man should stir; for 'tis
3308	The royal disposition of that beast
3309	To prey on nothing that doth seem as dead:
3310	This seen, Orlando did approach the man
3311	And found it was his brother, his elder brother.
3312	
3313	CELIA	O, I have heard him speak of that same brother;
3314	And he did render him the most unnatural
3315	That lived amongst men.
3316	
3317	OLIVER	And well he might so do,
3318	For well I know he was unnatural.
3319	
3320	ROSALIND	But, to Orlando: did he leave him there,
3321	Food to the suck'd and hungry lioness?
3322	
3323	OLIVER	Twice did he turn his back and purposed so;
3324	But kindness, nobler ever than revenge,
3325	And nature, stronger than his just occasion,
3326	Made him give battle to the lioness,
3327	Who quickly fell before him: in which hurtling
3328	From miserable slumber I awaked.
3329	
3330	CELIA	Are you his brother?
3331	
3332	ROSALIND	Wast you he rescued?
3333	
3334	CELIA	Was't you that did so oft contrive to kill him?
3335	
3336	OLIVER	'Twas I; but 'tis not I	I do not shame
3337	To tell you what I was, since my conversion
3338	So sweetly tastes, being the thing I am.
3339	
3340	ROSALIND	But, for the bloody napkin?
3341	
3342	OLIVER	By and by.
3343	When from the first to last betwixt us two
3344	Tears our recountments had most kindly bathed,
3345	As how I came into that desert place:--
3346	In brief, he led me to the gentle duke,
3347	Who gave me fresh array and entertainment,
3348	Committing me unto my brother's love;
3349	Who led me instantly unto his cave,
3350	There stripp'd himself, and here upon his arm
3351	The lioness had torn some flesh away,
3352	Which all this while had bled; and now he fainted
3353	And cried, in fainting, upon Rosalind.
3354	Brief, I recover'd him, bound up his wound;
3355	And, after some small space, being strong at heart,
3356	He sent me hither, stranger as I am,
3357	To tell this story, that you might excuse
3358	His broken promise, and to give this napkin
3359	Dyed in his blood unto the shepherd youth
3360	That he in sport doth call his Rosalind.
3361	
3362	[ROSALIND swoons]
3363	
3364	CELIA	Why, how now, Ganymede! sweet Ganymede!
3365	
3366	OLIVER	Many will swoon when they do look on blood.
3367	
3368	CELIA	There is more in it. Cousin Ganymede!
3369	
3370	OLIVER	Look, he recovers.
3371	
3372	ROSALIND	I would I were at home.
3373	
3374	CELIA	We'll lead you thither.
3375	I pray you, will you take him by the arm?
3376	
3377	OLIVER	Be of good cheer, youth: you a man! you lack a
3378	man's heart.
3379	
3380	ROSALIND	I do so, I confess it. Ah, sirrah, a body would
3381	think this was well counterfeited! I pray you, tell
3382	your brother how well I counterfeited. Heigh-ho!
3383	
3384	OLIVER	This was not counterfeit: there is too great
3385	testimony in your complexion that it was a passion
3386	of earnest.
3387	
3388	ROSALIND	Counterfeit, I assure you.
3389	
3390	OLIVER	Well then, take a good heart and counterfeit to be a man.
3391	
3392	ROSALIND	So I do: but, i' faith, I should have been a woman by right.
3393	
3394	CELIA	Come, you look paler and paler: pray you, draw
3395	homewards. Good sir, go with us.
3396	
3397	OLIVER	That will I, for I must bear answer back
3398	How you excuse my brother, Rosalind.
3399	
3400	ROSALIND	I shall devise something: but, I pray you, commend
3401	my counterfeiting to him. Will you go?
3402	
3403	[Exeunt]

3411	ACT V
3412	
3413	
3414	
3415	SCENE I	The forest.
3416	
3417	
3418	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
3419	
3420	TOUCHSTONE	We shall find a time, Audrey; patience, gentle Audrey.
3421	
3422	AUDREY	Faith, the priest was good enough, for all the old
3423	gentleman's saying.
3424	
3425	TOUCHSTONE	A most wicked Sir Oliver, Audrey, a most vile
3426	Martext. But, Audrey, there is a youth here in the
3427	forest lays claim to you.
3428	
3429	AUDREY	Ay, I know who 'tis; he hath no interest in me in
3430	the world: here comes the man you mean.
3431	
3432	TOUCHSTONE	It is meat and drink to me to see a clown: by my
3433	troth, we that have good wits have much to answer
3434	for; we shall be flouting; we cannot hold.
3435	
3436	[Enter WILLIAM]
3437	
3438	WILLIAM	Good even, Audrey.
3439	
3440	AUDREY	God ye good even, William.
3441	
3442	WILLIAM	And good even to you, sir.
3443	
3444	TOUCHSTONE	Good even, gentle friend. Cover thy head, cover thy
3445	head; nay, prithee, be covered. How old are you, friend?
3446	
3447	WILLIAM	Five and twenty, sir.
3448	
3449	TOUCHSTONE	A ripe age. Is thy name William?
3450	
3451	WILLIAM	William, sir.
3452	
3453	TOUCHSTONE	A fair name. Wast born i' the forest here?
3454	
3455	WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I thank God.
3456	
3457	TOUCHSTONE	'Thank God;' a good answer. Art rich?
3458	
3459	WILLIAM	Faith, sir, so so.
3460	
3461	TOUCHSTONE	'So so' is good, very good, very excellent good; and
3462	yet it is not; it is but so so. Art thou wise?
3463	
3464	WILLIAM	Ay, sir, I have a pretty wit.
3465	
3466	TOUCHSTONE	Why, thou sayest well. I do now remember a saying,
3467	'The fool doth think he is wise, but the wise man
3468	knows himself to be a fool.' The heathen
3469	philosopher, when he had a desire to eat a grape,
3470	would open his lips when he put it into his mouth;
3471	meaning thereby that grapes were made to eat and
3472	lips to open. You do love this maid?
3473	
3474	WILLIAM	I do, sir.
3475	
3476	TOUCHSTONE	Give me your hand. Art thou learned?
3477	
3478	WILLIAM	No, sir.
3479	
3480	TOUCHSTONE	Then learn this of me: to have, is to have; for it
3481	is a figure in rhetoric that drink, being poured out
3482	of a cup into a glass, by filling the one doth empty
3483	the other; for all your writers do consent that ipse
3484	is he: now, you are not ipse, for I am he.
3485	
3486	WILLIAM	Which he, sir?
3487	
3488	TOUCHSTONE	He, sir, that must marry this woman. Therefore, you
3489	clown, abandon,--which is in the vulgar leave,--the
3490	society,--which in the boorish is company,--of this
3491	female,--which in the common is woman; which
3492	together is, abandon the society of this female, or,
3493	clown, thou perishest; or, to thy better
3494	understanding, diest; or, to wit I kill thee, make
3495	thee away, translate thy life into death, thy
3496	liberty into bondage: I will deal in poison with
3497	thee, or in bastinado, or in steel; I will bandy
3498	with thee in faction; I will o'errun thee with
3499	policy; I will kill thee a hundred and fifty ways:
3500	therefore tremble and depart.
3501	
3502	AUDREY	Do, good William.
3503	
3504	WILLIAM	God rest you merry, sir.
3505	
3506	[Exit]
3507	
3508	[Enter CORIN]
3509	
3510	CORIN	Our master and mistress seeks you; come, away, away!
3511	
3512	TOUCHSTONE	Trip, Audrey! trip, Audrey! I attend, I attend.
3513	
3514	[Exeunt]

3522	ACT V
3523	
3524	
3525	
3526	SCENE II	The forest.
3527	
3528	
3529	[Enter ORLANDO and OLIVER]
3530	
3531	ORLANDO	Is't possible that on so little acquaintance you
3532	should like her? that but seeing you should love
3533	her? and loving woo? and, wooing, she should
3534	grant? and will you persever to enjoy her?
3535	
3536	OLIVER	Neither call the giddiness of it in question, the
3537	poverty of her, the small acquaintance, my sudden
3538	wooing, nor her sudden consenting; but say with me,
3539	I love Aliena; say with her that she loves me;
3540	consent with both that we may enjoy each other: it
3541	shall be to your good; for my father's house and all
3542	the revenue that was old Sir Rowland's will I
3543	estate upon you, and here live and die a shepherd.
3544	
3545	ORLANDO	You have my consent. Let your wedding be to-morrow:
3546	thither will I invite the duke and all's contented
3547	followers. Go you and prepare Aliena; for look
3548	you, here comes my Rosalind.
3549	
3550	[Enter ROSALIND]
3551	
3552	ROSALIND	God save you, brother.
3553	
3554	OLIVER	And you, fair sister.
3555	
3556	[Exit]
3557	
3558	ROSALIND	O, my dear Orlando, how it grieves me to see thee
3559	wear thy heart in a scarf!
3560	
3561	ORLANDO	It is my arm.
3562	
3563	ROSALIND	I thought thy heart had been wounded with the claws
3564	of a lion.
3565	
3566	ORLANDO	Wounded it is, but with the eyes of a lady.
3567	
3568	ROSALIND	Did your brother tell you how I counterfeited to
3569	swoon when he showed me your handkerchief?
3570	
3571	ORLANDO	Ay, and greater wonders than that.
3572	
3573	ROSALIND	O, I know where you are: nay, 'tis true: there was
3574	never any thing so sudden but the fight of two rams
3575	and Caesar's thrasonical brag of 'I came, saw, and
3576	overcame:' for your brother and my sister no sooner
3577	met but they looked, no sooner looked but they
3578	loved, no sooner loved but they sighed, no sooner
3579	sighed but they asked one another the reason, no
3580	sooner knew the reason but they sought the remedy;
3581	and in these degrees have they made a pair of stairs
3582	to marriage which they will climb incontinent, or
3583	else be incontinent before marriage: they are in
3584	the very wrath of love and they will together; clubs
3585	cannot part them.
3586	
3587	ORLANDO	They shall be married to-morrow, and I will bid the
3588	duke to the nuptial. But, O, how bitter a thing it
3589	is to look into happiness through another man's
3590	eyes! By so much the more shall I to-morrow be at
3591	the height of heart-heaviness, by how much I shall
3592	think my brother happy in having what he wishes for.
3593	
3594	ROSALIND	Why then, to-morrow I cannot serve your turn for Rosalind?
3595	
3596	ORLANDO	I can live no longer by thinking.
3597	
3598	ROSALIND	I will weary you then no longer with idle talking.
3599	Know of me then, for now I speak to some purpose,
3600	that I know you are a gentleman of good conceit: I
3601	speak not this that you should bear a good opinion
3602	of my knowledge, insomuch I say I know you are;
3603	neither do I labour for a greater esteem than may in
3604	some little measure draw a belief from you, to do
3605	yourself good and not to grace me. Believe then, if
3606	you please, that I can do strange things: I have,
3607	since I was three year old, conversed with a
3608	magician, most profound in his art and yet not
3609	damnable. If you do love Rosalind so near the heart
3610	as your gesture cries it out, when your brother
3611	marries Aliena, shall you marry her: I know into
3612	what straits of fortune she is driven; and it is
3613	not impossible to me, if it appear not inconvenient
3614	to you, to set her before your eyes tomorrow human
3615	as she is and without any danger.
3616	
3617	ORLANDO	Speakest thou in sober meanings?
3618	
3619	ROSALIND	By my life, I do; which I tender dearly, though I
3620	say I am a magician. Therefore, put you in your
3621	best array: bid your friends; for if you will be
3622	married to-morrow, you shall, and to Rosalind, if you will.
3623	
3624	[Enter SILVIUS and PHEBE]
3625	
3626	Look, here comes a lover of mine and a lover of hers.
3627	
3628	PHEBE	Youth, you have done me much ungentleness,
3629	To show the letter that I writ to you.
3630	
3631	ROSALIND	I care not if I have: it is my study
3632	To seem despiteful and ungentle to you:
3633	You are there followed by a faithful shepherd;
3634	Look upon him, love him; he worships you.
3635	
3636	PHEBE	Good shepherd, tell this youth what 'tis to love.
3637	
3638	SILVIUS	It is to be all made of sighs and tears;
3639	And so am I for Phebe.
3640	
3641	PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
3642	
3643	ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
3644	
3645	ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
3646	
3647	SILVIUS	It is to be all made of faith and service;
3648	And so am I for Phebe.
3649	
3650	PHEBE	And I for Ganymede.
3651	
3652	ORLANDO	And I for Rosalind.
3653	
3654	ROSALIND	And I for no woman.
3655	
3656	SILVIUS	It is to be all made of fantasy,
3657	All made of passion and all made of wishes,
3658	All adoration, duty, and observance,
3659	All humbleness, all patience and impatience,
3660	All purity, all trial, all observance;
3661	And so am I for Phebe.
3662	
3663	PHEBE	And so am I for Ganymede.
3664	
3665	ORLANDO	And so am I for Rosalind.
3666	
3667	ROSALIND	And so am I for no woman.
3668	
3669	PHEBE	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
3670	
3671	SILVIUS	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
3672	
3673	ORLANDO	If this be so, why blame you me to love you?
3674	
3675	ROSALIND	Who do you speak to, 'Why blame you me to love you?'
3676	
3677	ORLANDO	To her that is not here, nor doth not hear.
3678	
3679	ROSALIND	Pray you, no more of this; 'tis like the howling
3680	of Irish wolves against the moon.
3681	
3682	[To SILVIUS]
3683	
3684	I will help you, if I can:
3685	
3686	[To PHEBE]
3687	
3688	I would love you, if I could. To-morrow meet me all together.
3689	
3690	[To PHEBE]
3691	
3692	I will marry you, if ever I marry woman, and I'll be
3693	married to-morrow:
3694	
3695	[To ORLANDO]
3696	
3697	I will satisfy you, if ever I satisfied man, and you
3698	shall be married to-morrow:
3699	
3700	[To SILVIUS]
3701	
3702	I will content you, if what pleases you contents
3703	you, and you shall be married to-morrow.
3704	
3705	[To ORLANDO]
3706	
3707	As you love Rosalind, meet:
3708	
3709	[To SILVIUS]
3710	
3711	as you love Phebe, meet: and as I love no woman,
3712	I'll meet. So fare you well: I have left you commands.
3713	
3714	SILVIUS	I'll not fail, if I live.
3715	
3716	PHEBE	Nor I.
3717	
3718	ORLANDO	Nor I.
3719

3733	
3734	
3735	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
3736	
3737	TOUCHSTONE	To-morrow is the joyful day, Audrey; to-morrow will
3738	we be married.
3739	
3740	AUDREY	I do desire it with all my heart; and I hope it is
3741	no dishonest desire to desire to be a woman of the
3742	world. Here comes two of the banished duke's pages.
3743	
3744	[Enter two Pages]
3745	
3746	First Page	Well met, honest gentleman.
3747	
3748	TOUCHSTONE	By my troth, well met. Come, sit, sit, and a song.
3749	
3750	Second Page	We are for you: sit i' the middle.
3751	
3752	First Page	Shall we clap into't roundly, without hawking or
3753	spitting or saying we are hoarse, which are the only
3754	prologues to a bad voice?
3755	
3756	Second Page	I'faith, i'faith; and both in a tune, like two
3757	gipsies on a horse.
3758	
3759	SONG.
3760	It was a lover and his lass,
3761	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
3762	That o'er the green corn-field did pass
3763	In the spring time, the only pretty ring time,
3764	When birds do sing, hey ding a ding, ding:
3765	Sweet lovers love the spring.
3766	
3767	Between the acres of the rye,
3768	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino
3769	These pretty country folks would lie,
3770	In spring time, &c.
3771	
3772	This carol they began that hour,
3773	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino,
3774	How that a life was but a flower
3775	In spring time, &c.
3776	
3777	And therefore take the present time,
3778	With a hey, and a ho, and a hey nonino;
3779	For love is crowned with the prime
3780	In spring time, &c.
3781	
3782	TOUCHSTONE	Truly, young gentlemen, though there was no great
3783	matter in the ditty, yet the note was very
3784	untuneable.
3785	
3786	First Page	You are deceived, sir: we kept time, we lost not our time.
3787	
3788	TOUCHSTONE	By my troth, yes; I count it but time lost to hear
3789	such a foolish song. God be wi' you; and God mend
3790	your voices! Come, Audrey.
3791	
3792	[Exeunt]

3800	ACT V
3801	
3802	
3803	
3804	SCENE IV	The forest.
3805	
3806	
3807	[Enter DUKE SENIOR, AMIENS, JAQUES, ORLANDO, OLIVER,
3808	and CELIA]
3809	
3810	DUKE SENIOR	Dost thou believe, Orlando, that the boy
3811	Can do all this that he hath promised?
3812	
3813	ORLANDO	I sometimes do believe, and sometimes do not;
3814	As those that fear they hope, and know they fear.
3815	
3816	[Enter ROSALIND, SILVIUS, and PHEBE]
3817	
3818	ROSALIND	Patience once more, whiles our compact is urged:
3819	You say, if I bring in your Rosalind,
3820	You will bestow her on Orlando here?
3821	
3822	DUKE SENIOR	That would I, had I kingdoms to give with her.
3823	
3824	ROSALIND	And you say, you will have her, when I bring her?
3825	
3826	ORLANDO	That would I, were I of all kingdoms king.
3827	
3828	ROSALIND	You say, you'll marry me, if I be willing?
3829	
3830	PHEBE	That will I, should I die the hour after.
3831	
3832	ROSALIND	But if you do refuse to marry me,
3833	You'll give yourself to this most faithful shepherd?
3834	
3835	PHEBE	So is the bargain.
3836	
3837	ROSALIND	You say, that you'll have Phebe, if she will?
3838	
3839	SILVIUS	Though to have her and death were both one thing.
3840	
3841	ROSALIND	I have promised to make all this matter even.
3842	Keep you your word, O duke, to give your daughter;
3843	You yours, Orlando, to receive his daughter:
3844	Keep your word, Phebe, that you'll marry me,
3845	Or else refusing me, to wed this shepherd:
3846	Keep your word, Silvius, that you'll marry her.
3847	If she refuse me: and from hence I go,
3848	To make these doubts all even.
3849	
3850	[Exeunt ROSALIND and CELIA]
3851	
3852	DUKE SENIOR	I do remember in this shepherd boy
3853	Some lively touches of my daughter's favour.
3854	
3855	ORLANDO	My lord, the first time that I ever saw him
3856	Methought he was a brother to your daughter:
3857	But, my good lord, this boy is forest-born,
3858	And hath been tutor'd in the rudiments
3859	Of many desperate studies by his uncle,
3860	Whom he reports to be a great magician,
3861	Obscured in the circle of this forest.
3862	
3863	[Enter TOUCHSTONE and AUDREY]
3864	
3865	JAQUES	There is, sure, another flood toward, and these
3866	couples are coming to the ark. Here comes a pair of
3867	very strange beasts, which in all tongues are called fools.
3868	
3869	TOUCHSTONE	Salutation and greeting to you all!
3870	
3871	JAQUES	Good my lord, bid him welcome: this is the
3872	motley-minded gentleman that I have so often met in
3873	the forest: he hath been a courtier, he swears.
3874	
3875	TOUCHSTONE	If any man doubt that, let him put me to my
3876	purgation. I have trod a measure; I have flattered
3877	a lady; I have been politic with my friend, smooth
3878	with mine enemy; I have undone three tailors; I have
3879	had four quarrels, and like to have fought one.
3880	
3881	JAQUES	And how was that ta'en up?
3882	
3883	TOUCHSTONE	Faith, we met, and found the quarrel was upon the
3884	seventh cause.
3885	
3886	JAQUES	How seventh cause? Good my lord, like this fellow.
3887	
3888	DUKE SENIOR	I like him very well.
3889	
3890	TOUCHSTONE	God 'ild you, sir; I desire you of the like. I
3891	press in here, sir, amongst the rest of the country
3892	copulatives, to swear and to forswear: according as
3893	marriage binds and blood breaks: a poor virgin,
3894	sir, an ill-favoured thing, sir, but mine own; a poor
3895	humour of mine, sir, to take that that no man else
3896	will: rich honesty dwells like a miser, sir, in a
3897	poor house; as your pearl in your foul oyster.
3898	
3899	DUKE SENIOR	By my faith, he is very swift and sententious.
3900	
3901	TOUCHSTONE	According to the fool's bolt, sir, and such dulcet diseases.
3902	
3903	JAQUES	But, for the seventh cause; how did you find the
3904	quarrel on the seventh cause?
3905	
3906	TOUCHSTONE	Upon a lie seven times removed:--bear your body more
3907	seeming, Audrey:--as thus, sir. I did dislike the
3908	cut of a certain courtier's beard: he sent me word,
3909	if I said his beard was not cut well, he was in the
3910	mind it was: this is called the Retort Courteous.
3911	If I sent him word again 'it was not well cut,' he
3912	would send me word, he cut it to please himself:
3913	this is called the Quip Modest. If again 'it was
3914	not well cut,' he disabled my judgment: this is
3915	called the Reply Churlish. If again 'it was not
3916	well cut,' he would answer, I spake not true: this
3917	is called the Reproof Valiant. If again 'it was not
3918	well cut,' he would say I lied: this is called the
3919	Counter-cheque Quarrelsome: and so to the Lie
3920	Circumstantial and the Lie Direct.
3921	
3922	JAQUES	And how oft did you say his beard was not well cut?
3923	
3924	TOUCHSTONE	I durst go no further than the Lie Circumstantial,
3925	nor he durst not give me the Lie Direct; and so we
3926	measured swords and parted.
3927	
3928	JAQUES	Can you nominate in order now the degrees of the lie?
3929	
3930	TOUCHSTONE	O sir, we quarrel in print, by the book; as you have
3931	books for good manners: I will name you the degrees.
3932	The first, the Retort Courteous; the second, the
3933	Quip Modest; the third, the Reply Churlish; the
3934	fourth, the Reproof Valiant; the fifth, the
3935	Countercheque Quarrelsome; the sixth, the Lie with
3936	Circumstance; the seventh, the Lie Direct. All
3937	these you may avoid but the Lie Direct; and you may
3938	avoid that too, with an If. I knew when seven
3939	justices could not take up a quarrel, but when the
3940	parties were met themselves, one of them thought but
3941	of an If, as, 'If you said so, then I said so;' and
3942	they shook hands and swore brothers. Your If is the
3943	only peacemaker; much virtue in If.
3944	
3945	JAQUES	Is not this a rare fellow, my lord? he's as good at
3946	any thing and yet a fool.
3947	
3948	DUKE SENIOR	He uses his folly like a stalking-horse and under
3949	the presentation of that he shoots his wit.
3950	
3951	[Enter HYMEN, ROSALIND, and CELIA]
3952	
3953	[Still Music]
3954	
3955	HYMEN	        Then is there mirth in heaven,
3956	When earthly things made even
3957	Atone together.
3958	Good duke, receive thy daughter
3959	Hymen from heaven brought her,
3960	Yea, brought her hither,
3961	That thou mightst join her hand with his
3962	Whose heart within his bosom is.
3963	
3964	ROSALIND	[To DUKE SENIOR]  To you I give myself, for I am yours.
3965	
3966	[To ORLANDO]
3967	
3968	To you I give myself, for I am yours.
3969	
3970	DUKE SENIOR	If there be truth in sight, you are my daughter.
3971	
3972	ORLANDO	If there be truth in sight, you are my Rosalind.
3973	
3974	PHEBE	If sight and shape be true,
3975	Why then, my love adieu!
3976	
3977	ROSALIND	I'll have no father, if you be not he:
3978	I'll have no husband, if you be not he:
3979	Nor ne'er wed woman, if you be not she.
3980	
3981	HYMEN	        Peace, ho! I bar confusion:
3982	'Tis I must make conclusion
3983	Of these most strange events:
3984	Here's eight that must take hands
3985	To join in Hymen's bands,
3986	If truth holds true contents.
3987	You and you no cross shall part:
3988	You and you are heart in heart
3989	You to his love must accord,
3990	Or have a woman to your lord:
3991	You and you are sure together,
3992	As the winter to foul weather.
3993	Whiles a wedlock-hymn we sing,
3994	Feed yourselves with questioning;
3995	That reason wonder may diminish,
3996	How thus we met, and these things finish.
3997	
3998	SONG.
3999	Wedding is great Juno's crown:
4000	O blessed bond of board and bed!
4001	'Tis Hymen peoples every town;
4002	High wedlock then be honoured:
4003	Honour, high honour and renown,
4004	To Hymen, god of every town!
4005	
4006	DUKE SENIOR	O my dear niece, welcome thou art to me!
4007	Even daughter, welcome, in no less degree.
4008	
4009	PHEBE	I will not eat my word, now thou art mine;
4010	Thy faith my fancy to thee doth combine.
4011	
4012	[Enter JAQUES DE BOYS]
4013	
4014	JAQUES DE BOYS	Let me have audience for a word or two:
4015	I am the second son of old Sir Rowland,
4016	That bring these tidings to this fair assembly.
4017	Duke Frederick, hearing how that every day
4018	Men of great worth resorted to this forest,
4019	Address'd a mighty power; which were on foot,
4020	In his own conduct, purposely to take
4021	His brother here and put him to the sword:
4022	And to the skirts of this wild wood he came;
4023	Where meeting with an old religious man,
4024	After some question with him, was converted
4025	Both from his enterprise and from the world,
4026	His crown bequeathing to his banish'd brother,
4027	And all their lands restored to them again
4028	That were with him exiled. This to be true,
4029	I do engage my life.
4030	
4031	DUKE SENIOR	Welcome, young man;
4032	Thou offer'st fairly to thy brothers' wedding:
4033	To one his lands withheld, and to the other
4034	A land itself at large, a potent dukedom.
4035	First, in this forest, let us do those ends
4036	That here were well begun and well begot:
4037	And after, every of this happy number
4038	That have endured shrewd days and nights with us
4039	Shall share the good of our returned fortune,
4040	According to the measure of their states.
4041	Meantime, forget this new-fall'n dignity
4042	And fall into our rustic revelry.
4043	Play, music! And you, brides and bridegrooms all,
4044	With measure heap'd in joy, to the measures fall.
4045	
4046	JAQUES	Sir, by your patience. If I heard you rightly,
4047	The duke hath put on a religious life
4048	And thrown into neglect the pompous court?
4049	
4050	JAQUES DE BOYS	He hath.
4051	
4052	JAQUES	To him will I : out of these convertites
4053	There is much matter to be heard and learn'd.
4054	
4055	[To DUKE SENIOR]
4056	
4057	You to your former honour I bequeath;
4058	Your patience and your virtue well deserves it:
4059	
4060	[To ORLANDO]
4061	
4062	You to a love that your true faith doth merit:
4063	
4064	[To OLIVER]
4065	
4066	You to your land and love and great allies:
4067	
4068	[To SILVIUS]
4069	
4070	You to a long and well-deserved bed:
4071	
4072	[To TOUCHSTONE]
4073	
4074	And you to wrangling; for thy loving voyage
4075	Is but for two months victuall'd. So, to your pleasures:
4076	I am for other than for dancing measures.
4077	
4078	DUKE SENIOR	Stay, Jaques, stay.
4079	
4080	JAQUES	To see no pastime I	what you would have
4081	I'll stay to know at your abandon'd cave.
4082	
4083	[Exit]
4084	
4085	DUKE SENIOR	Proceed, proceed: we will begin these rites,
4086	As we do trust they'll end, in true delights.
4087	
4088	[A dance]
4089	
4090	
4091	
4092	
4093	AS YOU LIKE IT
4094	
4095	EPILOGUE
4096	
4097	
4098	ROSALIND	It is not the fashion to see the lady the epilogue;
4099	but it is no more unhandsome than to see the lord
4100	the prologue. If it be true that good wine needs
4101	no bush, 'tis true that a good play needs no
4102	epilogue; yet to good wine they do use good bushes,
4103	and good plays prove the better by the help of good
4104	epilogues. What a case am I in then, that am
4105	neither a good epilogue nor cannot insinuate with
4106	you in the behalf of a good play! I am not
4107	furnished like a beggar, therefore to beg will not
4108	become me: my way is to conjure you; and I'll begin
4109	with the women. I charge you, O women, for the love
4110	you bear to men, to like as much of this play as
4111	please you: and I charge you, O men, for the love
4112	you bear to women--as I perceive by your simpering,
4113	none of you hates them--that between you and the
4114	women the play may please. If I were a woman I
4115	would kiss as many of you as had beards that pleased
4116	me, complexions that liked me and breaths that I
4117	defied not: and, I am sure, as many as have good
4118	beards or good faces or sweet breaths will, for my
4119	kind offer, when I make curtsy, bid me farewell.
4120	
4121	[Exeunt]

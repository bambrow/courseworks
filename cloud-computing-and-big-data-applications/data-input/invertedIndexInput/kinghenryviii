103	THE PROLOGUE
104	
105	
106	I come no more to make you laugh: things now,
107	That bear a weighty and a serious brow,
108	Sad, high, and working, full of state and woe,
109	Such noble scenes as draw the eye to flow,
110	We now present. Those that can pity, here
111	May, if they think it well, let fall a tear;
112	The subject will deserve it. Such as give
113	Their money out of hope they may believe,
114	May here find truth too. Those that come to see
115	Only a show or two, and so agree
116	The play may pass, if they be still and willing,
117	I'll undertake may see away their shilling
118	Richly in two short hours. Only they
119	That come to hear a merry bawdy play,
120	A noise of targets, or to see a fellow
121	In a long motley coat guarded with yellow,
122	Will be deceived; for, gentle hearers, know,
123	To rank our chosen truth with such a show
124	As fool and fight is, beside forfeiting
125	Our own brains, and the opinion that we bring,
126	To make that only true we now intend,
127	Will leave us never an understanding friend.
128	Therefore, for goodness' sake, and as you are known
129	The first and happiest hearers of the town,
130	Be sad, as we would make ye: think ye see
131	The very persons of our noble story
132	As they were living; think you see them great,
133	And follow'd with the general throng and sweat
134	Of thousand friends; then in a moment, see
135	How soon this mightiness meets misery:
136	And, if you can be merry then, I'll say
137	A man may weep upon his wedding-day.

142	KING HENRY VIII
143	
144	
145	ACT I
146	
147	
148	
149	SCENE I	London. An ante-chamber in the palace.
150	
151	
152	[Enter NORFOLK at one door; at the other, BUCKINGHAM
153	and ABERGAVENNY]
154	
155	BUCKINGHAM	Good morrow, and well met. How have ye done
156	Since last we saw in France?
157	
158	NORFOLK	I thank your grace,
159	Healthful; and ever since a fresh admirer
160	Of what I saw there.
161	
162	BUCKINGHAM	An untimely ague
163	Stay'd me a prisoner in my chamber when
164	Those suns of glory, those two lights of men,
165	Met in the vale of Andren.
166	
167	NORFOLK	'Twixt Guynes and Arde:
168	I was then present, saw them salute on horseback;
169	Beheld them, when they lighted, how they clung
170	In their embracement, as they grew together;
171	Which had they, what four throned ones could have weigh'd
172	Such a compounded one?
173	
174	BUCKINGHAM	All the whole time
175	I was my chamber's prisoner.
176	
177	NORFOLK	Then you lost
178	The view of earthly glory: men might say,
179	Till this time pomp was single, but now married
180	To one above itself. Each following day
181	Became the next day's master, till the last
182	Made former wonders its. To-day the French,
183	All clinquant, all in gold, like heathen gods,
184	Shone down the English; and, to-morrow, they
185	Made Britain India: every man that stood
186	Show'd like a mine. Their dwarfish pages were
187	As cherubins, all guilt: the madams too,
188	Not used to toil, did almost sweat to bear
189	The pride upon them, that their very labour
190	Was to them as a painting: now this masque
191	Was cried incomparable; and the ensuing night
192	Made it a fool and beggar. The two kings,
193	Equal in lustre, were now best, now worst,
194	As presence did present them; him in eye,
195	Still him in praise: and, being present both
196	'Twas said they saw but one; and no discerner
197	Durst wag his tongue in censure. When these suns--
198	For so they phrase 'em--by their heralds challenged
199	The noble spirits to arms, they did perform
200	Beyond thought's compass; that former fabulous story,
201	Being now seen possible enough, got credit,
202	That Bevis was believed.
203	
204	BUCKINGHAM	O, you go far.
205	
206	NORFOLK	As I belong to worship and affect
207	In honour honesty, the tract of every thing
208	Would by a good discourser lose some life,
209	Which action's self was tongue to. All was royal;
210	To the disposing of it nought rebell'd.
211	Order gave each thing view; the office did
212	Distinctly his full function.
213	
214	BUCKINGHAM	Who did guide,
215	I mean, who set the body and the limbs
216	Of this great sport together, as you guess?
217	
218	NORFOLK	One, certes, that promises no element
219	In such a business.
220	
221	BUCKINGHAM	I pray you, who, my lord?
222	
223	NORFOLK	All this was order'd by the good discretion
224	Of the right reverend Cardinal of York.
225	
226	BUCKINGHAM	The devil speed him! no man's pie is freed
227	From his ambitious finger. What had he
228	To do in these fierce vanities? I wonder
229	That such a keech can with his very bulk
230	Take up the rays o' the beneficial sun
231	And keep it from the earth.
232	
233	NORFOLK	Surely, sir,
234	There's in him stuff that puts him to these ends;
235	For, being not propp'd by ancestry, whose grace
236	Chalks successors their way, nor call'd upon
237	For high feats done to the crown; neither allied
238	For eminent assistants; but, spider-like,
239	Out of his self-drawing web, he gives us note,
240	The force of his own merit makes his way
241	A gift that heaven gives for him, which buys
242	A place next to the king.
243	
244	ABERGAVENNY	I cannot tell
245	What heaven hath given him,--let some graver eye
246	Pierce into that; but I can see his pride
247	Peep through each part of him: whence has he that,
248	If not from hell? the devil is a niggard,
249	Or has given all before, and he begins
250	A new hell in himself.
251	
252	BUCKINGHAM	Why the devil,
253	Upon this French going out, took he upon him,
254	Without the privity o' the king, to appoint
255	Who should attend on him? He makes up the file
256	Of all the gentry; for the most part such
257	To whom as great a charge as little honour
258	He meant to lay upon: and his own letter,
259	The honourable board of council out,
260	Must fetch him in the papers.
261	
262	ABERGAVENNY	I do know
263	Kinsmen of mine, three at the least, that have
264	By this so sickened their estates, that never
265	They shall abound as formerly.
266	
267	BUCKINGHAM	O, many
268	Have broke their backs with laying manors on 'em
269	For this great journey. What did this vanity
270	But minister communication of
271	A most poor issue?
272	
273	NORFOLK	                  Grievingly I think,
274	The peace between the French and us not values
275	The cost that did conclude it.
276	
277	BUCKINGHAM	Every man,
278	After the hideous storm that follow'd, was
279	A thing inspired; and, not consulting, broke
280	Into a general prophecy; That this tempest,
281	Dashing the garment of this peace, aboded
282	The sudden breach on't.
283	
284	NORFOLK	Which is budded out;
285	For France hath flaw'd the league, and hath attach'd
286	Our merchants' goods at Bourdeaux.
287	
288	ABERGAVENNY	Is it therefore
289	The ambassador is silenced?
290	
291	NORFOLK	Marry, is't.
292	
293	ABERGAVENNY	A proper title of a peace; and purchased
294	At a superfluous rate!
295	
296	BUCKINGHAM	Why, all this business
297	Our reverend cardinal carried.
298	
299	NORFOLK	Like it your grace,
300	The state takes notice of the private difference
301	Betwixt you and the cardinal. I advise you--
302	And take it from a heart that wishes towards you
303	Honour and plenteous safety--that you read
304	The cardinal's malice and his potency
305	Together; to consider further that
306	What his high hatred would effect wants not
307	A minister in his power. You know his nature,
308	That he's revengeful, and I know his sword
309	Hath a sharp edge: it's long and, 't may be said,
310	It reaches far, and where 'twill not extend,
311	Thither he darts it. Bosom up my counsel,
312	You'll find it wholesome. Lo, where comes that rock
313	That I advise your shunning.
314	
315	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, the purse borne before him,
316	certain of the Guard, and two Secretaries with
317	papers. CARDINAL WOLSEY in his passage fixeth his
318	eye on BUCKINGHAM, and BUCKINGHAM on him, both full
319	of disdain]
320	
321	CARDINAL WOLSEY	The Duke of Buckingham's surveyor, ha?
322	Where's his examination?
323	
324	First Secretary	Here, so please you.
325	
326	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Is he in person ready?
327	
328	First Secretary	Ay, please your grace.
329	
330	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Well, we shall then know more; and Buckingham
331	Shall lessen this big look.
332	
333	[Exeunt CARDINAL WOLSEY and his Train]
334	
335	BUCKINGHAM	This butcher's cur is venom-mouth'd, and I
336	Have not the power to muzzle him; therefore best
337	Not wake him in his slumber. A beggar's book
338	Outworths a noble's blood.
339	
340	NORFOLK	What, are you chafed?
341	Ask God for temperance; that's the appliance only
342	Which your disease requires.
343	
344	BUCKINGHAM	I read in's looks
345	Matter against me; and his eye reviled
346	Me, as his abject object: at this instant
347	He bores me with some trick: he's gone to the king;
348	I'll follow and outstare him.
349	
350	NORFOLK	Stay, my lord,
351	And let your reason with your choler question
352	What 'tis you go about: to climb steep hills
353	Requires slow pace at first: anger is like
354	A full-hot horse, who being allow'd his way,
355	Self-mettle tires him. Not a man in England
356	Can advise me like you: be to yourself
357	As you would to your friend.
358	
359	BUCKINGHAM	I'll to the king;
360	And from a mouth of honour quite cry down
361	This Ipswich fellow's insolence; or proclaim
362	There's difference in no persons.
363	
364	NORFOLK	Be advised;
365	Heat not a furnace for your foe so hot
366	That it do singe yourself: we may outrun,
367	By violent swiftness, that which we run at,
368	And lose by over-running. Know you not,
369	The fire that mounts the liquor til run o'er,
370	In seeming to augment it wastes it? Be advised:
371	I say again, there is no English soul
372	More stronger to direct you than yourself,
373	If with the sap of reason you would quench,
374	Or but allay, the fire of passion.
375	
376	BUCKINGHAM	Sir,
377	I am thankful to you; and I'll go along
378	By your prescription: but this top-proud fellow,
379	Whom from the flow of gall I name not but
380	From sincere motions, by intelligence,
381	And proofs as clear as founts in July when
382	We see each grain of gravel, I do know
383	To be corrupt and treasonous.
384	
385	NORFOLK	Say not 'treasonous.'
386	
387	BUCKINGHAM	To the king I'll say't; and make my vouch as strong
388	As shore of rock. Attend. This holy fox,
389	Or wolf, or both,--for he is equal ravenous
390	As he is subtle, and as prone to mischief
391	As able to perform't; his mind and place
392	Infecting one another, yea, reciprocally--
393	Only to show his pomp as well in France
394	As here at home, suggests the king our master
395	To this last costly treaty, the interview,
396	That swallow'd so much treasure, and like a glass
397	Did break i' the rinsing.
398	
399	NORFOLK	Faith, and so it did.
400	
401	BUCKINGHAM	Pray, give me favour, sir. This cunning cardinal
402	The articles o' the combination drew
403	As himself pleased; and they were ratified
404	As he cried 'Thus let be': to as much end
405	As give a crutch to the dead: but our count-cardinal
406	Has done this, and 'tis well; for worthy Wolsey,
407	Who cannot err, he did it. Now this follows,--
408	Which, as I take it, is a kind of puppy
409	To the old dam, treason,--Charles the emperor,
410	Under pretence to see the queen his aunt--
411	For 'twas indeed his colour, but he came
412	To whisper Wolsey,--here makes visitation:
413	His fears were, that the interview betwixt
414	England and France might, through their amity,
415	Breed him some prejudice; for from this league
416	Peep'd harms that menaced him: he privily
417	Deals with our cardinal; and, as I trow,--
418	Which I do well; for I am sure the emperor
419	Paid ere he promised; whereby his suit was granted
420	Ere it was ask'd; but when the way was made,
421	And paved with gold, the emperor thus desired,
422	That he would please to alter the king's course,
423	And break the foresaid peace. Let the king know,
424	As soon he shall by me, that thus the cardinal
425	Does buy and sell his honour as he pleases,
426	And for his own advantage.
427	
428	NORFOLK	I am sorry
429	To hear this of him; and could wish he were
430	Something mistaken in't.
431	
432	BUCKINGHAM	No, not a syllable:
433	I  do pronounce him in that very shape
434	He shall appear in proof.
435	
436	[Enter BRANDON, a Sergeant-at-arms before him, and
437	two or three of the Guard]
438	
439	BRANDON	Your office, sergeant; execute it.
440	
441	Sergeant	Sir,
442	My lord the Duke of Buckingham, and Earl
443	Of Hereford, Stafford, and Northampton, I
444	Arrest thee of high treason, in the name
445	Of our most sovereign king.
446	
447	BUCKINGHAM	Lo, you, my lord,
448	The net has fall'n upon me! I shall perish
449	Under device and practise.
450	
451	BRANDON	I am sorry
452	To see you ta'en from liberty, to look on
453	The business present: 'tis his highness' pleasure
454	You shall to the Tower.
455	
456	BUCKINGHAM	It will help me nothing
457	To plead mine innocence; for that dye is on me
458	Which makes my whitest part black. The will of heaven
459	Be done in this and all things! I obey.
460	O my Lord Abergavenny, fare you well!
461	
462	BRANDON	Nay, he must bear you company. The king
463	
464	[To ABERGAVENNY]
465	
466	Is pleased you shall to the Tower, till you know
467	How he determines further.
468	
469	ABERGAVENNY	As the duke said,
470	The will of heaven be done, and the king's pleasure
471	By me obey'd!
472	
473	BRANDON	                  Here is a warrant from
474	The king to attach Lord Montacute; and the bodies
475	Of the duke's confessor, John de la Car,
476	One Gilbert Peck, his chancellor--
477	
478	BUCKINGHAM	So, so;
479	These are the limbs o' the plot: no more, I hope.
480	
481	BRANDON	A monk o' the Chartreux.
482	
483	BUCKINGHAM	O, Nicholas Hopkins?
484	
485	BRANDON	He.
486	
487	BUCKINGHAM	My surveyor is false; the o'er-great cardinal
488	Hath show'd him gold; my life is spann'd already:
489	I am the shadow of poor Buckingham,
490	Whose figure even this instant cloud puts on,
491	By darkening my clear sun. My lord, farewell.
492	
493	[Exeunt]

498	KING HENRY VIII
499	
500	
501	ACT I
502	
503	
504	
505	SCENE II	The same. The council-chamber.
506	
507	
508	[Cornets. Enter KING HENRY VIII, leaning on
509	CARDINAL WOLSEY's shoulder, the Nobles, and LOVELL;
510	CARDINAL WOLSEY places himself under KING HENRY
511	VIII's feet on his right side]
512	
513	KING HENRY VIII	My life itself, and the best heart of it,
514	Thanks you for this great care: I stood i' the level
515	Of a full-charged confederacy, and give thanks
516	To you that choked it. Let be call'd before us
517	That gentleman of Buckingham's; in person
518	I'll hear him his confessions justify;
519	And point by point the treasons of his master
520	He shall again relate.
521	
522	[A noise within, crying 'Room for the Queen!' Enter
523	QUEEN KATHARINE, ushered by NORFOLK, and SUFFOLK:
524	she kneels. KING HENRY VIII riseth from his state,
525	takes her up, kisses and placeth her by him]
526	
527	QUEEN KATHARINE	Nay, we must longer kneel: I am a suitor.
528	
529	KING HENRY VIII	Arise, and take place by us: half your suit
530	Never name to us; you have half our power:
531	The other moiety, ere you ask, is given;
532	Repeat your will and take it.
533	
534	QUEEN KATHARINE	Thank your majesty.
535	That you would love yourself, and in that love
536	Not unconsider'd leave your honour, nor
537	The dignity of your office, is the point
538	Of my petition.
539	
540	KING HENRY VIII	                  Lady mine, proceed.
541	
542	QUEEN KATHARINE	I am solicited, not by a few,
543	And those of true condition, that your subjects
544	Are in great grievance: there have been commissions
545	Sent down among 'em, which hath flaw'd the heart
546	Of all their loyalties: wherein, although,
547	My good lord cardinal, they vent reproaches
548	Most bitterly on you, as putter on
549	Of these exactions, yet the king our master--
550	Whose honour heaven shield from soil!--even he
551	escapes not
552	Language unmannerly, yea, such which breaks
553	The sides of loyalty, and almost appears
554	In loud rebellion.
555	
556	NORFOLK	                  Not almost appears,
557	It doth appear; for, upon these taxations,
558	The clothiers all, not able to maintain
559	The many to them longing, have put off
560	The spinsters, carders, fullers, weavers, who,
561	Unfit for other life, compell'd by hunger
562	And lack of other means, in desperate manner
563	Daring the event to the teeth, are all in uproar,
564	And danger serves among then!
565	
566	KING HENRY VIII	Taxation!
567	Wherein? and what taxation? My lord cardinal,
568	You that are blamed for it alike with us,
569	Know you of this taxation?
570	
571	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Please you, sir,
572	I know but of a single part, in aught
573	Pertains to the state; and front but in that file
574	Where others tell steps with me.
575	
576	QUEEN KATHARINE	No, my lord,
577	You know no more than others; but you frame
578	Things that are known alike; which are not wholesome
579	To those which would not know them, and yet must
580	Perforce be their acquaintance. These exactions,
581	Whereof my sovereign would have note, they are
582	Most pestilent to the bearing; and, to bear 'em,
583	The back is sacrifice to the load. They say
584	They are devised by you; or else you suffer
585	Too hard an exclamation.
586	
587	KING HENRY VIII	Still exaction!
588	The nature of it? in what kind, let's know,
589	Is this exaction?
590	
591	QUEEN KATHARINE	                  I am much too venturous
592	In tempting of your patience; but am bolden'd
593	Under your promised pardon. The subjects' grief
594	Comes through commissions, which compel from each
595	The sixth part of his substance, to be levied
596	Without delay; and the pretence for this
597	Is named, your wars in France: this makes bold mouths:
598	Tongues spit their duties out, and cold hearts freeze
599	Allegiance in them; their curses now
600	Live where their prayers did: and it's come to pass,
601	This tractable obedience is a slave
602	To each incensed will. I would your highness
603	Would give it quick consideration, for
604	There is no primer business.
605	
606	KING HENRY VIII	By my life,
607	This is against our pleasure.
608	
609	CARDINAL WOLSEY	And for me,
610	I have no further gone in this than by
611	A single voice; and that not pass'd me but
612	By learned approbation of the judges. If I am
613	Traduced by ignorant tongues, which neither know
614	My faculties nor person, yet will be
615	The chronicles of my doing, let me say
616	'Tis but the fate of place, and the rough brake
617	That virtue must go through. We must not stint
618	Our necessary actions, in the fear
619	To cope malicious censurers; which ever,
620	As ravenous fishes, do a vessel follow
621	That is new-trimm'd, but benefit no further
622	Than vainly longing. What we oft do best,
623	By sick interpreters, once weak ones, is
624	Not ours, or not allow'd; what worst, as oft,
625	Hitting a grosser quality, is cried up
626	For our best act. If we shall stand still,
627	In fear our motion will be mock'd or carp'd at,
628	We should take root here where we sit, or sit
629	State-statues only.
630	
631	KING HENRY VIII	Things done well,
632	And with a care, exempt themselves from fear;
633	Things done without example, in their issue
634	Are to be fear'd. Have you a precedent
635	Of this commission? I believe, not any.
636	We must not rend our subjects from our laws,
637	And stick them in our will. Sixth part of each?
638	A trembling contribution! Why, we take
639	From every tree lop, bark, and part o' the timber;
640	And, though we leave it with a root, thus hack'd,
641	The air will drink the sap. To every county
642	Where this is question'd send our letters, with
643	Free pardon to each man that has denied
644	The force of this commission: pray, look to't;
645	I put it to your care.
646	
647	CARDINAL WOLSEY	A word with you.
648	
649	[To the Secretary]
650	
651	Let there be letters writ to every shire,
652	Of the king's grace and pardon. The grieved commons
653	Hardly conceive of me; let it be noised
654	That through our intercession this revokement
655	And pardon comes: I shall anon advise you
656	Further in the proceeding.
657	
658	[Exit Secretary]
659	
660	[Enter Surveyor]
661	
662	QUEEN KATHARINE	I am sorry that the Duke of Buckingham
663	Is run in your displeasure.
664	
665	KING HENRY VIII	It grieves many:
666	The gentleman is learn'd, and a most rare speaker;
667	To nature none more bound; his training such,
668	That he may furnish and instruct great teachers,
669	And never seek for aid out of himself. Yet see,
670	When these so noble benefits shall prove
671	Not well disposed, the mind growing once corrupt,
672	They turn to vicious forms, ten times more ugly
673	Than ever they were fair. This man so complete,
674	Who was enroll'd 'mongst wonders, and when we,
675	Almost with ravish'd listening, could not find
676	His hour of speech a minute; he, my lady,
677	Hath into monstrous habits put the graces
678	That once were his, and is become as black
679	As if besmear'd in hell. Sit by us; you shall hear--
680	This was his gentleman in trust--of him
681	Things to strike honour sad. Bid him recount
682	The fore-recited practises; whereof
683	We cannot feel too little, hear too much.
684	
685	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Stand forth, and with bold spirit relate what you,
686	Most like a careful subject, have collected
687	Out of the Duke of Buckingham.
688	
689	KING HENRY VIII	Speak freely.
690	
691	Surveyor	First, it was usual with him, every day
692	It would infect his speech, that if the king
693	Should without issue die, he'll carry it so
694	To make the sceptre his: these very words
695	I've heard him utter to his son-in-law,
696	Lord Abergavenny; to whom by oath he menaced
697	Revenge upon the cardinal.
698	
699	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Please your highness, note
700	This dangerous conception in this point.
701	Not friended by by his wish, to your high person
702	His will is most malignant; and it stretches
703	Beyond you, to your friends.
704	
705	QUEEN KATHARINE	My learn'd lord cardinal,
706	Deliver all with charity.
707	
708	KING HENRY VIII	Speak on:
709	How grounded he his title to the crown,
710	Upon our fail? to this point hast thou heard him
711	At any time speak aught?
712	
713	Surveyor	He was brought to this
714	By a vain prophecy of Nicholas Hopkins.
715	
716	KING HENRY VIII	What was that Hopkins?
717	
718	Surveyor	Sir, a Chartreux friar,
719	His confessor, who fed him every minute
720	With words of sovereignty.
721	
722	KING HENRY VIII	How know'st thou this?
723	
724	Surveyor	Not long before your highness sped to France,
725	The duke being at the Rose, within the parish
726	Saint Lawrence Poultney, did of me demand
727	What was the speech among the Londoners
728	Concerning the French journey: I replied,
729	Men fear'd the French would prove perfidious,
730	To the king's danger. Presently the duke
731	Said, 'twas the fear, indeed; and that he doubted
732	'Twould prove the verity of certain words
733	Spoke by a holy monk; 'that oft,' says he,
734	'Hath sent to me, wishing me to permit
735	John de la Car, my chaplain, a choice hour
736	To hear from him a matter of some moment:
737	Whom after under the confession's seal
738	He solemnly had sworn, that what he spoke
739	My chaplain to no creature living, but
740	To me, should utter, with demure confidence
741	This pausingly ensued: neither the king nor's heirs,
742	Tell you the duke, shall prosper: bid him strive
743	To gain the love o' the commonalty: the duke
744	Shall govern England.'
745	
746	QUEEN KATHARINE	If I know you well,
747	You were the duke's surveyor, and lost your office
748	On the complaint o' the tenants: take good heed
749	You charge not in your spleen a noble person
750	And spoil your nobler soul: I say, take heed;
751	Yes, heartily beseech you.
752	
753	KING HENRY VIII	Let him on.
754	Go forward.
755	
756	Surveyor	     On my soul, I'll speak but truth.
757	I told my lord the duke, by the devil's illusions
758	The monk might be deceived; and that 'twas dangerous for him
759	To ruminate on this so far, until
760	It forged him some design, which, being believed,
761	It was much like to do: he answer'd, 'Tush,
762	It can do me no damage;' adding further,
763	That, had the king in his last sickness fail'd,
764	The cardinal's and Sir Thomas Lovell's heads
765	Should have gone off.
766	
767	KING HENRY VIII	Ha! what, so rank? Ah ha!
768	There's mischief in this man: canst thou say further?
769	
770	Surveyor	I can, my liege.
771	
772	KING HENRY VIII	                  Proceed.
773	
774	Surveyor	Being at Greenwich,
775	After your highness had reproved the duke
776	About Sir William Blomer,--
777	
778	KING HENRY VIII	I remember
779	Of such a time: being my sworn servant,
780	The duke retain'd him his. But on; what hence?
781	
782	Surveyor	'If,' quoth he, 'I for this had been committed,
783	As, to the Tower, I thought, I would have play'd
784	The part my father meant to act upon
785	The usurper Richard; who, being at Salisbury,
786	Made suit to come in's presence; which if granted,
787	As he made semblance of his duty, would
788	Have put his knife to him.'
789	
790	KING HENRY VIII	A giant traitor!
791	
792	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Now, madam, may his highness live in freedom,
793	and this man out of prison?
794	
795	QUEEN KATHARINE	God mend all!
796	
797	KING HENRY VIII	There's something more would out of thee; what say'st?
798	
799	Surveyor	After 'the duke his father,' with 'the knife,'
800	He stretch'd him, and, with one hand on his dagger,
801	Another spread on's breast, mounting his eyes
802	He did discharge a horrible oath; whose tenor
803	Was,--were he evil used, he would outgo
804	His father by as much as a performance
805	Does an irresolute purpose.
806	
807	KING HENRY VIII	There's his period,
808	To sheathe his knife in us. He is attach'd;
809	Call him to present trial: if he may
810	Find mercy in the law, 'tis his: if none,
811	Let him not seek 't of us: by day and night,
812	He's traitor to the height.
813

825	
826	SCENE III	An ante-chamber in the palace.
827	
828	
829	[Enter Chamberlain and SANDS]
830	
831	Chamberlain	Is't possible the spells of France should juggle
832	Men into such strange mysteries?
833	
834	SANDS	New customs,
835	Though they be never so ridiculous,
836	Nay, let 'em be unmanly, yet are follow'd.
837	
838	Chamberlain	As far as I see, all the good our English
839	Have got by the late voyage is but merely
840	A fit or two o' the face; but they are shrewd ones;
841	For when they hold 'em, you would swear directly
842	Their very noses had been counsellors
843	To Pepin or Clotharius, they keep state so.
844	
845	SANDS	They have all new legs, and lame ones: one would take it,
846	That never saw 'em pace before, the spavin
847	Or springhalt reign'd among 'em.
848	
849	Chamberlain	Death! my lord,
850	Their clothes are after such a pagan cut too,
851	That, sure, they've worn out Christendom.
852	
853	[Enter LOVELL]
854	
855	How now!
856	What news, Sir Thomas Lovell?
857	
858	LOVELL	Faith, my lord,
859	I hear of none, but the new proclamation
860	That's clapp'd upon the court-gate.
861	
862	Chamberlain	What is't for?
863	
864	LOVELL	The reformation of our travell'd gallants,
865	That fill the court with quarrels, talk, and tailors.
866	
867	Chamberlain	I'm glad 'tis there: now I would pray our monsieurs
868	To think an English courtier may be wise,
869	And never see the Louvre.
870	
871	LOVELL	They must either,
872	For so run the conditions, leave those remnants
873	Of fool and feather that they got in France,
874	With all their honourable point of ignorance
875	Pertaining thereunto, as fights and fireworks,
876	Abusing better men than they can be,
877	Out of a foreign wisdom, renouncing clean
878	The faith they have in tennis, and tall stockings,
879	Short blister'd breeches, and those types of travel,
880	And understand again like honest men;
881	Or pack to their old playfellows: there, I take it,
882	They may, 'cum privilegio,' wear away
883	The lag end of their lewdness and be laugh'd at.
884	
885	SANDS	'Tis time to give 'em physic, their diseases
886	Are grown so catching.
887	
888	Chamberlain	What a loss our ladies
889	Will have of these trim vanities!
890	
891	LOVELL	Ay, marry,
892	There will be woe indeed, lords: the sly whoresons
893	Have got a speeding trick to lay down ladies;
894	A French song and a fiddle has no fellow.
895	
896	SANDS	The devil fiddle 'em! I am glad they are going,
897	For, sure, there's no converting of 'em: now
898	An honest country lord, as I am, beaten
899	A long time out of play, may bring his plainsong
900	And have an hour of hearing; and, by'r lady,
901	Held current music too.
902	
903	Chamberlain	Well said, Lord Sands;
904	Your colt's tooth is not cast yet.
905	
906	SANDS	No, my lord;
907	Nor shall not, while I have a stump.
908	
909	Chamberlain	Sir Thomas,
910	Whither were you a-going?
911	
912	LOVELL	To the cardinal's:
913	Your lordship is a guest too.
914	
915	Chamberlain	O, 'tis true:
916	This night he makes a supper, and a great one,
917	To many lords and ladies; there will be
918	The beauty of this kingdom, I'll assure you.
919	
920	LOVELL	That churchman bears a bounteous mind indeed,
921	A hand as fruitful as the land that feeds us;
922	His dews fall every where.
923	
924	Chamberlain	No doubt he's noble;
925	He had a black mouth that said other of him.
926	
927	SANDS	He may, my lord; has wherewithal: in him
928	Sparing would show a worse sin than ill doctrine:
929	Men of his way should be most liberal;
930	They are set here for examples.
931	
932	Chamberlain	True, they are so:
933	But few now give so great ones. My barge stays;
934	Your lordship shall along. Come, good Sir Thomas,
935	We shall be late else; which I would not be,
936	For I was spoke to, with Sir Henry Guildford
937	This night to be comptrollers.
938	
939	SANDS	I am your lordship's.

956	[Hautboys. A small table under a state for CARDINAL
957	WOLSEY, a longer table for the guests. Then enter
958	ANNE and divers other Ladies and Gentlemen as
959	guests, at one door; at another door, enter
960	GUILDFORD]
961	
962	GUILDFORD	Ladies, a general welcome from his grace
963	Salutes ye all; this night he dedicates
964	To fair content and you: none here, he hopes,
965	In all this noble bevy, has brought with her
966	One care abroad; he would have all as merry
967	As, first, good company, good wine, good welcome,
968	Can make good people. O, my lord, you're tardy:
969	
970	[Enter Chamberlain, SANDS, and LOVELL]
971	
972	The very thought of this fair company
973	Clapp'd wings to me.
974	
975	Chamberlain	You are young, Sir Harry Guildford.
976	
977	SANDS	Sir Thomas Lovell, had the cardinal
978	But half my lay thoughts in him, some of these
979	Should find a running banquet ere they rested,
980	I think would better please 'em: by my life,
981	They are a sweet society of fair ones.
982	
983	LOVELL	O, that your lordship were but now confessor
984	To one or two of these!
985	
986	SANDS	I would I were;
987	They should find easy penance.
988	
989	LOVELL	Faith, how easy?
990	
991	SANDS	As easy as a down-bed would afford it.
992	
993	Chamberlain	Sweet ladies, will it please you sit? Sir Harry,
994	Place you that side; I'll take the charge of this:
995	His grace is entering. Nay, you must not freeze;
996	Two women placed together makes cold weather:
997	My Lord Sands, you are one will keep 'em waking;
998	Pray, sit between these ladies.
999	
1000	SANDS	By my faith,
1001	And thank your lordship. By your leave, sweet ladies:
1002	If I chance to talk a little wild, forgive me;
1003	I had it from my father.
1004	
1005	ANNE	Was he mad, sir?
1006	
1007	SANDS	O, very mad, exceeding mad, in love too:
1008	But he would bite none; just as I do now,
1009	He would kiss you twenty with a breath.
1010	
1011	[Kisses her]
1012	
1013	Chamberlain	Well said, my lord.
1014	So, now you're fairly seated. Gentlemen,
1015	The penance lies on you, if these fair ladies
1016	Pass away frowning.
1017	
1018	SANDS	For my little cure,
1019	Let me alone.
1020	
1021	[Hautboys. Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, and takes his state]
1022	
1023	CARDINAL WOLSEY	You're welcome, my fair guests: that noble lady,
1024	Or gentleman, that is not freely merry,
1025	Is not my friend: this, to confirm my welcome;
1026	And to you all, good health.
1027	
1028	[Drinks]
1029	
1030	SANDS	Your grace is noble:
1031	Let me have such a bowl may hold my thanks,
1032	And save me so much talking.
1033	
1034	CARDINAL WOLSEY	My Lord Sands,
1035	I am beholding to you: cheer your neighbours.
1036	Ladies, you are not merry: gentlemen,
1037	Whose fault is this?
1038	
1039	SANDS	The red wine first must rise
1040	In their fair cheeks, my lord; then we shall have 'em
1041	Talk us to silence.
1042	
1043	ANNE	You are a merry gamester,
1044	My Lord Sands.
1045	
1046	SANDS	                  Yes, if I make my play.
1047	Here's to your ladyship: and pledge it, madam,
1048	For 'tis to such a thing,--
1049	
1050	ANNE	You cannot show me.
1051	
1052	SANDS	I told your grace they would talk anon.
1053	
1054	[Drum and trumpet, chambers discharged]
1055	
1056	CARDINAL WOLSEY	What's that?
1057	
1058	Chamberlain	Look out there, some of ye.
1059	
1060	[Exit Servant]
1061	
1062	CARDINAL WOLSEY	What warlike voice,
1063	And to what end is this? Nay, ladies, fear not;
1064	By all the laws of war you're privileged.
1065	
1066	[Re-enter Servant]
1067	
1068	Chamberlain	How now! what is't?
1069	
1070	Servant	A noble troop of strangers;
1071	For so they seem: they've left their barge and landed;
1072	And hither make, as great ambassadors
1073	From foreign princes.
1074	
1075	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Good lord chamberlain,
1076	Go, give 'em welcome; you can speak the French tongue;
1077	And, pray, receive 'em nobly, and conduct 'em
1078	Into our presence, where this heaven of beauty
1079	Shall shine at full upon them. Some attend him.
1080	
1081	[Exit Chamberlain, attended. All rise, and tables removed]
1082	
1083	You have now a broken banquet; but we'll mend it.
1084	A good digestion to you all: and once more
1085	I shower a welcome on ye; welcome all.
1086	
1087	[Hautboys. Enter KING HENRY VIII and others, as
1088	masquers, habited like shepherds, ushered by the
1089	Chamberlain. They pass directly before CARDINAL
1090	WOLSEY, and gracefully salute him]
1091	
1092	A noble company! what are their pleasures?
1093	
1094	Chamberlain	Because they speak no English, thus they pray'd
1095	To tell your grace, that, having heard by fame
1096	Of this so noble and so fair assembly
1097	This night to meet here, they could do no less
1098	Out of the great respect they bear to beauty,
1099	But leave their flocks; and, under your fair conduct,
1100	Crave leave to view these ladies and entreat
1101	An hour of revels with 'em.
1102	
1103	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Say, lord chamberlain,
1104	They have done my poor house grace; for which I pay 'em
1105	A thousand thanks, and pray 'em take their pleasures.
1106	
1107	[They choose Ladies for the dance. KING HENRY VIII
1108	chooses ANNE]
1109	
1110	KING HENRY VIII	The fairest hand I ever touch'd! O beauty,
1111	Till now I never knew thee!
1112	
1113	[Music. Dance]
1114	
1115	CARDINAL WOLSEY	My lord!
1116	
1117	Chamberlain	Your grace?
1118	
1119	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Pray, tell 'em thus much from me:
1120	There should be one amongst 'em, by his person,
1121	More worthy this place than myself; to whom,
1122	If I but knew him, with my love and duty
1123	I would surrender it.
1124	
1125	Chamberlain	I will, my lord.
1126	
1127	[Whispers the Masquers]
1128	
1129	CARDINAL WOLSEY	What say they?
1130	
1131	Chamberlain	                  Such a one, they all confess,
1132	There is indeed; which they would have your grace
1133	Find out, and he will take it.
1134	
1135	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Let me see, then.
1136	By all your good leaves, gentlemen; here I'll make
1137	My royal choice.
1138	
1139	KING HENRY VIII	                  Ye have found him, cardinal:
1140	
1141	[Unmasking]
1142	
1143	You hold a fair assembly; you do well, lord:
1144	You are a churchman, or, I'll tell you, cardinal,
1145	I should judge now unhappily.
1146	
1147	CARDINAL WOLSEY	I am glad
1148	Your grace is grown so pleasant.
1149	
1150	KING HENRY VIII	My lord chamberlain,
1151	Prithee, come hither: what fair lady's that?
1152	
1153	Chamberlain	An't please your grace, Sir Thomas Bullen's daughter--
1154	The Viscount Rochford,--one of her highness' women.
1155	
1156	KING HENRY VIII	By heaven, she is a dainty one. Sweetheart,
1157	I were unmannerly, to take you out,
1158	And not to kiss you. A health, gentlemen!
1159	Let it go round.
1160	
1161	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Sir Thomas Lovell, is the banquet ready
1162	I' the privy chamber?
1163	
1164	LOVELL	Yes, my lord.
1165	
1166	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Your grace,
1167	I fear, with dancing is a little heated.
1168	
1169	KING HENRY VIII	I fear, too much.
1170	
1171	CARDINAL WOLSEY	                  There's fresher air, my lord,
1172	In the next chamber.
1173	
1174	KING HENRY VIII	Lead in your ladies, every one: sweet partner,
1175	I must not yet forsake you: let's be merry:
1176	Good my lord cardinal, I have half a dozen healths
1177	To drink to these fair ladies, and a measure
1178	To lead 'em once again; and then let's dream
1179	Who's best in favour. Let the music knock it.
1180	
1181	[Exeunt with trumpets]

1186	KING HENRY VIII
1187	
1188	
1189	ACT II
1190	
1191	
1192	
1193	SCENE I	Westminster. A street.
1194	
1195	
1196	[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting]
1197	
1198	First Gentleman	Whither away so fast?
1199	
1200	Second Gentleman	O, God save ye!
1201	Even to the hall, to hear what shall become
1202	Of the great Duke of Buckingham.
1203	
1204	First Gentleman	I'll save you
1205	That labour, sir. All's now done, but the ceremony
1206	Of bringing back the prisoner.
1207	
1208	Second Gentleman	Were you there?
1209	
1210	First Gentleman	Yes, indeed, was I.
1211	
1212	Second Gentleman	Pray, speak what has happen'd.
1213	
1214	First Gentleman	You may guess quickly what.
1215	
1216	Second Gentleman	Is he found guilty?
1217	
1218	First Gentleman	Yes, truly is he, and condemn'd upon't.
1219	
1220	Second Gentleman	I am sorry for't.
1221	
1222	First Gentleman	                  So are a number more.
1223	
1224	Second Gentleman	But, pray, how pass'd it?
1225	
1226	First Gentleman	I'll tell you in a little. The great duke
1227	Came to the bar; where to his accusations
1228	He pleaded still not guilty and alleged
1229	Many sharp reasons to defeat the law.
1230	The king's attorney on the contrary
1231	Urged on the examinations, proofs, confessions
1232	Of divers witnesses; which the duke desired
1233	To have brought viva voce to his face:
1234	At which appear'd against him his surveyor;
1235	Sir Gilbert Peck his chancellor; and John Car,
1236	Confessor to him; with that devil-monk,
1237	Hopkins, that made this mischief.
1238	
1239	Second Gentleman	That was he
1240	That fed him with his prophecies?
1241	
1242	First Gentleman	The same.
1243	All these accused him strongly; which he fain
1244	Would have flung from him, but, indeed, he could not:
1245	And so his peers, upon this evidence,
1246	Have found him guilty of high treason. Much
1247	He spoke, and learnedly, for life; but all
1248	Was either pitied in him or forgotten.
1249	
1250	Second Gentleman	After all this, how did he bear himself?
1251	
1252	First Gentleman	When he was brought again to the bar, to hear
1253	His knell rung out, his judgment, he was stirr'd
1254	With such an agony, he sweat extremely,
1255	And something spoke in choler, ill, and hasty:
1256	But he fell to himself again, and sweetly
1257	In all the rest show'd a most noble patience.
1258	
1259	Second Gentleman	I do not think he fears death.
1260	
1261	First Gentleman	Sure, he does not:
1262	He never was so womanish; the cause
1263	He may a little grieve at.
1264	
1265	Second Gentleman	Certainly
1266	The cardinal is the end of this.
1267	
1268	First Gentleman	'Tis likely,
1269	By all conjectures: first, Kildare's attainder,
1270	Then deputy of Ireland; who removed,
1271	Earl Surrey was sent thither, and in haste too,
1272	Lest he should help his father.
1273	
1274	Second Gentleman	That trick of state
1275	Was a deep envious one.
1276	
1277	First Gentleman	At his return
1278	No doubt he will requite it. This is noted,
1279	And generally, whoever the king favours,
1280	The cardinal instantly will find employment,
1281	And far enough from court too.
1282	
1283	Second Gentleman	All the commons
1284	Hate him perniciously, and, o' my conscience,
1285	Wish him ten fathom deep: this duke as much
1286	They love and dote on; call him bounteous Buckingham,
1287	The mirror of all courtesy;--
1288	
1289	First Gentleman	Stay there, sir,
1290	And see the noble ruin'd man you speak of.
1291	
1292	[Enter BUCKINGHAM from his arraignment; tip-staves
1293	before him; the axe with the edge towards him;
1294	halberds on each side: accompanied with LOVELL,
1295	VAUX, SANDS, and common people]
1296	
1297	Second Gentleman	Let's stand close, and behold him.
1298	
1299	BUCKINGHAM	All good people,
1300	You that thus far have come to pity me,
1301	Hear what I say, and then go home and lose me.
1302	I have this day received a traitor's judgment,
1303	And by that name must die: yet, heaven bear witness,
1304	And if I have a conscience, let it sink me,
1305	Even as the axe falls, if I be not faithful!
1306	The law I bear no malice for my death;
1307	'T has done, upon the premises, but justice:
1308	But those that sought it I could wish more Christians:
1309	Be what they will, I heartily forgive 'em:
1310	Yet let 'em look they glory not in mischief,
1311	Nor build their evils on the graves of great men;
1312	For then my guiltless blood must cry against 'em.
1313	For further life in this world I ne'er hope,
1314	Nor will I sue, although the king have mercies
1315	More than I dare make faults. You few that loved me,
1316	And dare be bold to weep for Buckingham,
1317	His noble friends and fellows, whom to leave
1318	Is only bitter to him, only dying,
1319	Go with me, like good angels, to my end;
1320	And, as the long divorce of steel falls on me,
1321	Make of your prayers one sweet sacrifice,
1322	And lift my soul to heaven. Lead on, o' God's name.
1323	
1324	LOVELL	I do beseech your grace, for charity,
1325	If ever any malice in your heart
1326	Were hid against me, now to forgive me frankly.
1327	
1328	BUCKINGHAM	Sir Thomas Lovell, I as free forgive you
1329	As I would be forgiven: I forgive all;
1330	There cannot be those numberless offences
1331	'Gainst me, that I cannot take peace with:
1332	no black envy
1333	Shall mark my grave. Commend me to his grace;
1334	And if he speak of Buckingham, pray, tell him
1335	You met him half in heaven: my vows and prayers
1336	Yet are the king's; and, till my soul forsake,
1337	Shall cry for blessings on him: may he live
1338	Longer than I have time to tell his years!
1339	Ever beloved and loving may his rule be!
1340	And when old time shall lead him to his end,
1341	Goodness and he fill up one monument!
1342	
1343	LOVELL	To the water side I must conduct your grace;
1344	Then give my charge up to Sir Nicholas Vaux,
1345	Who undertakes you to your end.
1346	
1347	VAUX	Prepare there,
1348	The duke is coming: see the barge be ready;
1349	And fit it with such furniture as suits
1350	The greatness of his person.
1351	
1352	BUCKINGHAM	Nay, Sir Nicholas,
1353	Let it alone; my state now will but mock me.
1354	When I came hither, I was lord high constable
1355	And Duke of Buckingham; now, poor Edward Bohun:
1356	Yet I am richer than my base accusers,
1357	That never knew what truth meant: I now seal it;
1358	And with that blood will make 'em one day groan for't.
1359	My noble father, Henry of Buckingham,
1360	Who first raised head against usurping Richard,
1361	Flying for succor to his servant Banister,
1362	Being distress'd, was by that wretch betray'd,
1363	And without trial fell; God's peace be with him!
1364	Henry the Seventh succeeding, truly pitying
1365	My father's loss, like a most royal prince,
1366	Restored me to my honours, and, out of ruins,
1367	Made my name once more noble. Now his son,
1368	Henry the Eighth, life, honour, name and all
1369	That made me happy at one stroke has taken
1370	For ever from the world. I had my trial,
1371	And, must needs say, a noble one; which makes me,
1372	A little happier than my wretched father:
1373	Yet thus far we are one in fortunes: both
1374	Fell by our servants, by those men we loved most;
1375	A most unnatural and faithless service!
1376	Heaven has an end in all: yet, you that hear me,
1377	This from a dying man receive as certain:
1378	Where you are liberal of your loves and counsels
1379	Be sure you be not loose; for those you make friends
1380	And give your hearts to, when they once perceive
1381	The least rub in your fortunes, fall away
1382	Like water from ye, never found again
1383	But where they mean to sink ye. All good people,
1384	Pray for me! I must now forsake ye: the last hour
1385	Of my long weary life is come upon me. Farewell:
1386	And when you would say something that is sad,
1387	Speak how I fell. I have done; and God forgive me!
1388	
1389	[Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and Train]
1390	
1391	First Gentleman	O, this is full of pity! Sir, it calls,
1392	I fear, too many curses on their beads
1393	That were the authors.
1394	
1395	Second Gentleman	If the duke be guiltless,
1396	'Tis full of woe: yet I can give you inkling
1397	Of an ensuing evil, if it fall,
1398	Greater than this.
1399	
1400	First Gentleman	                  Good angels keep it from us!
1401	What may it be? You do not doubt my faith, sir?
1402	
1403	Second Gentleman	This secret is so weighty, 'twill require
1404	A strong faith to conceal it.
1405	
1406	First Gentleman	Let me have it;
1407	I do not talk much.
1408	
1409	Second Gentleman	I am confident,
1410	You shall, sir: did you not of late days hear
1411	A buzzing of a separation
1412	Between the king and Katharine?
1413	
1414	First Gentleman	Yes, but it held not:
1415	For when the king once heard it, out of anger
1416	He sent command to the lord mayor straight
1417	To stop the rumor, and allay those tongues
1418	That durst disperse it.
1419	
1420	Second Gentleman	But that slander, sir,
1421	Is found a truth now: for it grows again
1422	Fresher than e'er it was; and held for certain
1423	The king will venture at it. Either the cardinal,
1424	Or some about him near, have, out of malice
1425	To the good queen, possess'd him with a scruple
1426	That will undo her: to confirm this too,
1427	Cardinal Campeius is arrived, and lately;
1428	As all think, for this business.
1429	
1430	First Gentleman	'Tis the cardinal;
1431	And merely to revenge him on the emperor
1432	For not bestowing on him, at his asking,
1433	The archbishopric of Toledo, this is purposed.
1434	
1435	Second Gentleman	I think you have hit the mark: but is't not cruel
1436	That she should feel the smart of this? The cardinal
1437	Will have his will, and she must fall.
1438	
1439	First Gentleman	'Tis woful.
1440	We are too open here to argue this;
1441	Let's think in private more.
1442	
1443	[Exeunt]

1448	KING HENRY VIII
1449	
1450	
1451	ACT II
1452	
1453	
1454	
1455	SCENE II	An ante-chamber in the palace.
1456	
1457	
1458	[Enter Chamberlain, reading a letter]
1459	
1460	Chamberlain	'My lord, the horses your lordship sent for, with
1461	all the care I had, I saw well chosen, ridden, and
1462	furnished. They were young and handsome, and of the
1463	best breed in the north. When they were ready to
1464	set out for London, a man of my lord cardinal's, by
1465	commission and main power, took 'em from me; with
1466	this reason: His master would be served before a
1467	subject, if not before the king; which stopped our
1468	mouths, sir.'
1469	I fear he will indeed: well, let him have them:
1470	He will have all, I think.
1471	
1472	[Enter, to Chamberlain, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]
1473	
1474	NORFOLK	Well met, my lord chamberlain.
1475	
1476	Chamberlain	Good day to both your graces.
1477	
1478	SUFFOLK	How is the king employ'd?
1479	
1480	Chamberlain	I left him private,
1481	Full of sad thoughts and troubles.
1482	
1483	NORFOLK	What's the cause?
1484	
1485	Chamberlain	It seems the marriage with his brother's wife
1486	Has crept too near his conscience.
1487	
1488	SUFFOLK	No, his conscience
1489	Has crept too near another lady.
1490	
1491	NORFOLK	'Tis so:
1492	This is the cardinal's doing, the king-cardinal:
1493	That blind priest, like the eldest son of fortune,
1494	Turns what he list. The king will know him one day.
1495	
1496	SUFFOLK	Pray God he do! he'll never know himself else.
1497	
1498	NORFOLK	How holily he works in all his business!
1499	And with what zeal! for, now he has crack'd the league
1500	Between us and the emperor, the queen's great nephew,
1501	He dives into the king's soul, and there scatters
1502	Dangers, doubts, wringing of the conscience,
1503	Fears, and despairs; and all these for his marriage:
1504	And out of all these to restore the king,
1505	He counsels a divorce; a loss of her
1506	That, like a jewel, has hung twenty years
1507	About his neck, yet never lost her lustre;
1508	Of her that loves him with that excellence
1509	That angels love good men with; even of her
1510	That, when the greatest stroke of fortune falls,
1511	Will bless the king: and is not this course pious?
1512	
1513	Chamberlain	Heaven keep me from such counsel! 'Tis most true
1514	These news are every where; every tongue speaks 'em,
1515	And every true heart weeps for't: all that dare
1516	Look into these affairs see this main end,
1517	The French king's sister. Heaven will one day open
1518	The king's eyes, that so long have slept upon
1519	This bold bad man.
1520	
1521	SUFFOLK	                  And free us from his slavery.
1522	
1523	NORFOLK	We had need pray,
1524	And heartily, for our deliverance;
1525	Or this imperious man will work us all
1526	From princes into pages: all men's honours
1527	Lie like one lump before him, to be fashion'd
1528	Into what pitch he please.
1529	
1530	SUFFOLK	For me, my lords,
1531	I love him not, nor fear him; there's my creed:
1532	As I am made without him, so I'll stand,
1533	If the king please; his curses and his blessings
1534	Touch me alike, they're breath I not believe in.
1535	I knew him, and I know him; so I leave him
1536	To him that made him proud, the pope.
1537	
1538	NORFOLK	Let's in;
1539	And with some other business put the king
1540	From these sad thoughts, that work too much upon him:
1541	My lord, you'll bear us company?
1542	
1543	Chamberlain	Excuse me;
1544	The king has sent me otherwhere: besides,
1545	You'll find a most unfit time to disturb him:
1546	Health to your lordships.
1547	
1548	NORFOLK	Thanks, my good lord chamberlain.
1549	
1550	[Exit Chamberlain; and KING HENRY VIII draws the
1551	curtain, and sits reading pensively]
1552	
1553	SUFFOLK	How sad he looks! sure, he is much afflicted.
1554	
1555	KING HENRY VIII	Who's there, ha?
1556	
1557	NORFOLK	                  Pray God he be not angry.
1558	
1559	KING HENRY VIII	Who's there, I say? How dare you thrust yourselves
1560	Into my private meditations?
1561	Who am I? ha?
1562	
1563	NORFOLK	A gracious king that pardons all offences
1564	Malice ne'er meant: our breach of duty this way
1565	Is business of estate; in which we come
1566	To know your royal pleasure.
1567	
1568	KING HENRY VIII	Ye are too bold:
1569	Go to; I'll make ye know your times of business:
1570	Is this an hour for temporal affairs, ha?
1571	
1572	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS, with
1573	a commission]
1574	
1575	Who's there? my good lord cardinal? O my Wolsey,
1576	The quiet of my wounded conscience;
1577	Thou art a cure fit for a king.
1578	
1579	[To CARDINAL CAMPEIUS]
1580	
1581	You're welcome,
1582	Most learned reverend sir, into our kingdom:
1583	Use us and it.
1584	
1585	[To CARDINAL WOLSEY]
1586	
1587	My good lord, have great care
1588	I be not found a talker.
1589	
1590	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Sir, you cannot.
1591	I would your grace would give us but an hour
1592	Of private conference.
1593	
1594	KING HENRY VIII	[To NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]
1595	We are busy; go.
1596	
1597	NORFOLK	[Aside to SUFFOLK]
1598	This priest has no pride in him?
1599	
1600	SUFFOLK	[Aside to NORFOLK]             Not to speak of:
1601	I would not be so sick though for his place:
1602	But this cannot continue.
1603	
1604	NORFOLK	[Aside to SUFFOLK]      If it do,
1605	I'll venture one have-at-him.
1606	
1607	SUFFOLK	[Aside to NORFOLK]          I another.
1608	
1609	[Exeunt NORFOLK and SUFFOLK]
1610	
1611	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Your grace has given a precedent of wisdom
1612	Above all princes, in committing freely
1613	Your scruple to the voice of Christendom:
1614	Who can be angry now? what envy reach you?
1615	The Spaniard, tied blood and favour to her,
1616	Must now confess, if they have any goodness,
1617	The trial just and noble. All the clerks,
1618	I mean the learned ones, in Christian kingdoms
1619	Have their free voices: Rome, the nurse of judgment,
1620	Invited by your noble self, hath sent
1621	One general tongue unto us, this good man,
1622	This just and learned priest, Cardinal Campeius;
1623	Whom once more I present unto your highness.
1624	
1625	KING HENRY VIII	And once more in mine arms I bid him welcome,
1626	And thank the holy conclave for their loves:
1627	They have sent me such a man I would have wish'd for.
1628	
1629	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Your grace must needs deserve all strangers' loves,
1630	You are so noble. To your highness' hand
1631	I tender my commission; by whose virtue,
1632	The court of Rome commanding, you, my lord
1633	Cardinal of York, are join'd with me their servant
1634	In the unpartial judging of this business.
1635	
1636	KING HENRY VIII	Two equal men. The queen shall be acquainted
1637	Forthwith for what you come. Where's Gardiner?
1638	
1639	CARDINAL WOLSEY	I know your majesty has always loved her
1640	So dear in heart, not to deny her that
1641	A woman of less place might ask by law:
1642	Scholars allow'd freely to argue for her.
1643	
1644	KING HENRY VIII	Ay, and the best she shall have; and my favour
1645	To him that does best: God forbid else. Cardinal,
1646	Prithee, call Gardiner to me, my new secretary:
1647	I find him a fit fellow.
1648	
1649	[Exit CARDINAL WOLSEY]
1650	
1651	[Re-enter CARDINAL WOLSEY, with GARDINER]
1652	
1653	CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside to GARDINER]  Give me your hand much joy and
1654	favour to you;
1655	You are the king's now.
1656	
1657	GARDINER	[Aside to CARDINAL WOLSEY]
1658	But to be commanded
1659	For ever by your grace, whose hand has raised me.
1660	
1661	KING HENRY VIII	Come hither, Gardiner.
1662	
1663	[Walks and whispers]
1664	
1665	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	My Lord of York, was not one Doctor Pace
1666	In this man's place before him?
1667	
1668	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Yes, he was.
1669	
1670	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Was he not held a learned man?
1671	
1672	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Yes, surely.
1673	
1674	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Believe me, there's an ill opinion spread then
1675	Even of yourself, lord cardinal.
1676	
1677	CARDINAL WOLSEY	How! of me?
1678	
1679	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	They will not stick to say you envied him,
1680	And fearing he would rise, he was so virtuous,
1681	Kept him a foreign man still; which so grieved him,
1682	That he ran mad and died.
1683	
1684	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Heaven's peace be with him!
1685	That's Christian care enough: for living murmurers
1686	There's places of rebuke. He was a fool;
1687	For he would needs be virtuous: that good fellow,
1688	If I command him, follows my appointment:
1689	I will have none so near else. Learn this, brother,
1690	We live not to be grip'd by meaner persons.
1691	
1692	KING HENRY VIII	Deliver this with modesty to the queen.
1693	
1694	[Exit GARDINER]
1695	
1696	The most convenient place that I can think of
1697	For such receipt of learning is Black-Friars;
1698	There ye shall meet about this weighty business.
1699	My Wolsey, see it furnish'd. O, my lord,
1700	Would it not grieve an able man to leave
1701	So sweet a bedfellow? But, conscience, conscience!
1702	O, 'tis a tender place; and I must leave her.
1703

1712	ACT II
1713	
1714	
1715	
1716	SCENE III	An ante-chamber of the QUEEN'S apartments.
1717	
1718	
1719	[Enter ANNE and an Old Lady]
1720	
1721	ANNE	Not for that neither: here's the pang that pinches:
1722	His highness having lived so long with her, and she
1723	So good a lady that no tongue could ever
1724	Pronounce dishonour of her; by my life,
1725	She never knew harm-doing: O, now, after
1726	So many courses of the sun enthroned,
1727	Still growing in a majesty and pomp, the which
1728	To leave a thousand-fold more bitter than
1729	'Tis sweet at first to acquire,--after this process,
1730	To give her the avaunt! it is a pity
1731	Would move a monster.
1732	
1733	Old Lady	Hearts of most hard temper
1734	Melt and lament for her.
1735	
1736	ANNE	O, God's will! much better
1737	She ne'er had known pomp: though't be temporal,
1738	Yet, if that quarrel, fortune, do divorce
1739	It from the bearer, 'tis a sufferance panging
1740	As soul and body's severing.
1741	
1742	Old Lady	Alas, poor lady!
1743	She's a stranger now again.
1744	
1745	ANNE	So much the more
1746	Must pity drop upon her. Verily,
1747	I swear, 'tis better to be lowly born,
1748	And range with humble livers in content,
1749	Than to be perk'd up in a glistering grief,
1750	And wear a golden sorrow.
1751	
1752	Old Lady	Our content
1753	Is our best having.
1754	
1755	ANNE	By my troth and maidenhead,
1756	I would not be a queen.
1757	
1758	Old Lady	Beshrew me, I would,
1759	And venture maidenhead for't; and so would you,
1760	For all this spice of your hypocrisy:
1761	You, that have so fair parts of woman on you,
1762	Have too a woman's heart; which ever yet
1763	Affected eminence, wealth, sovereignty;
1764	Which, to say sooth, are blessings; and which gifts,
1765	Saving your mincing, the capacity
1766	Of your soft cheveril conscience would receive,
1767	If you might please to stretch it.
1768	
1769	ANNE	Nay, good troth.
1770	
1771	Old Lady	Yes, troth, and troth; you would not be a queen?
1772	
1773	ANNE	No, not for all the riches under heaven.
1774	
1775	Old Lady:	'Tis strange: a three-pence bow'd would hire me,
1776	Old as I am, to queen it: but, I pray you,
1777	What think you of a duchess? have you limbs
1778	To bear that load of title?
1779	
1780	ANNE	No, in truth.
1781	
1782	Old Lady	Then you are weakly made: pluck off a little;
1783	I would not be a young count in your way,
1784	For more than blushing comes to: if your back
1785	Cannot vouchsafe this burthen,'tis too weak
1786	Ever to get a boy.
1787	
1788	ANNE	                  How you do talk!
1789	I swear again, I would not be a queen
1790	For all the world.
1791	
1792	Old Lady	                  In faith, for little England
1793	You'ld venture an emballing: I myself
1794	Would for Carnarvonshire, although there long'd
1795	No more to the crown but that. Lo, who comes here?
1796	
1797	[Enter Chamberlain]
1798	
1799	Chamberlain	Good morrow, ladies. What were't worth to know
1800	The secret of your conference?
1801	
1802	ANNE	My good lord,
1803	Not your demand; it values not your asking:
1804	Our mistress' sorrows we were pitying.
1805	
1806	Chamberlain	It was a gentle business, and becoming
1807	The action of good women: there is hope
1808	All will be well.
1809	
1810	ANNE	                  Now, I pray God, amen!
1811	
1812	Chamberlain	You bear a gentle mind, and heavenly blessings
1813	Follow such creatures. That you may, fair lady,
1814	Perceive I speak sincerely, and high note's
1815	Ta'en of your many virtues, the king's majesty
1816	Commends his good opinion of you, and
1817	Does purpose honour to you no less flowing
1818	Than Marchioness of Pembroke: to which title
1819	A thousand pound a year, annual support,
1820	Out of his grace he adds.
1821	
1822	ANNE	I do not know
1823	What kind of my obedience I should tender;
1824	More than my all is nothing: nor my prayers
1825	Are not words duly hallow'd, nor my wishes
1826	More worth than empty vanities; yet prayers and wishes
1827	Are all I can return. Beseech your lordship,
1828	Vouchsafe to speak my thanks and my obedience,
1829	As from a blushing handmaid, to his highness;
1830	Whose health and royalty I pray for.
1831	
1832	Chamberlain	Lady,
1833	I shall not fail to approve the fair conceit
1834	The king hath of you.
1835	
1836	[Aside]
1837	
1838	I have perused her well;
1839	Beauty and honour in her are so mingled
1840	That they have caught the king: and who knows yet
1841	But from this lady may proceed a gem
1842	To lighten all this isle? I'll to the king,
1843	And say I spoke with you.
1844	
1845	[Exit Chamberlain]
1846	
1847	ANNE	My honour'd lord.
1848	
1849	Old Lady	Why, this it is; see, see!
1850	I have been begging sixteen years in court,
1851	Am yet a courtier beggarly, nor could
1852	Come pat betwixt too early and too late
1853	For any suit of pounds; and you, O fate!
1854	A very fresh-fish here--fie, fie, fie upon
1855	This compell'd fortune!--have your mouth fill'd up
1856	Before you open it.
1857	
1858	ANNE	This is strange to me.
1859	
1860	Old Lady	How tastes it? is it bitter? forty pence, no.
1861	There was a lady once, 'tis an old story,
1862	That would not be a queen, that would she not,
1863	For all the mud in Egypt: have you heard it?
1864	
1865	ANNE	Come, you are pleasant.
1866	
1867	Old Lady	With your theme, I could
1868	O'ermount the lark. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
1869	A thousand pounds a year for pure respect!
1870	No other obligation! By my life,
1871	That promises moe thousands: honour's train
1872	Is longer than his foreskirt. By this time
1873	I know your back will bear a duchess: say,
1874	Are you not stronger than you were?
1875	
1876	ANNE	Good lady,
1877	Make yourself mirth with your particular fancy,
1878	And leave me out on't. Would I had no being,
1879	If this salute my blood a jot: it faints me,
1880	To think what follows.
1881	The queen is comfortless, and we forgetful
1882	In our long absence: pray, do not deliver
1883	What here you've heard to her.
1884	
1885	Old Lady	What do you think me?

1898	
1899	SCENE IV	A hall in Black-Friars.
1900	
1901	
1902	[Trumpets, sennet, and cornets. Enter two Vergers,
1903	with short silver wands; next them, two Scribes, in
1904	the habit of doctors; after them, CANTERBURY alone;
1905	after him, LINCOLN, Ely, Rochester, and Saint
1906	Asaph; next them, with some small distance, follows
1907	a Gentleman bearing the purse, with the great seal,
1908	and a cardinal's hat; then two Priests, bearing
1909	each a silver cross; then a Gentleman-usher
1910	bare-headed, accompanied with a Sergeant-at-arms
1911	bearing a silver mace; then two Gentlemen bearing
1912	two great silver pillars; after them, side by side,
1913	CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS; two Noblemen
1914	with the sword and mace. KING HENRY VIII takes
1915	place under the cloth of state; CARDINAL WOLSEY and
1916	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS sit under him as judges. QUEEN
1917	KATHARINE takes place some distance from KING
1918	HENRY VIII. The Bishops place themselves on each
1919	side the court, in manner of a consistory; below
1920	them, the Scribes. The Lords sit next the Bishops.
1921	The rest of the Attendants stand in convenient
1922	order about the stage]
1923	
1924	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Whilst our commission from Rome is read,
1925	Let silence be commanded.
1926	
1927	KING HENRY VIII	What's the need?
1928	It hath already publicly been read,
1929	And on all sides the authority allow'd;
1930	You may, then, spare that time.
1931	
1932	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Be't so. Proceed.
1933	
1934	Scribe	Say, Henry King of England, come into the court.
1935	
1936	Crier	Henry King of England, &c.
1937	
1938	KING HENRY VIII	Here.
1939	
1940	Scribe	Say, Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.
1941	
1942	Crier	Katharine Queen of England, &c.
1943	
1944	[QUEEN KATHARINE makes no answer, rises out of her
1945	chair, goes about the court, comes to KING HENRY
1946	VIII, and kneels at his feet; then speaks]
1947	
1948	QUEEN KATHARINE	Sir, I desire you do me right and justice;
1949	And to bestow your pity on me: for
1950	I am a most poor woman, and a stranger,
1951	Born out of your dominions; having here
1952	No judge indifferent, nor no more assurance
1953	Of equal friendship and proceeding. Alas, sir,
1954	In what have I offended you? what cause
1955	Hath my behavior given to your displeasure,
1956	That thus you should proceed to put me off,
1957	And take your good grace from me? Heaven witness,
1958	I have been to you a true and humble wife,
1959	At all times to your will conformable;
1960	Ever in fear to kindle your dislike,
1961	Yea, subject to your countenance, glad or sorry
1962	As I saw it inclined: when was the hour
1963	I ever contradicted your desire,
1964	Or made it not mine too? Or which of your friends
1965	Have I not strove to love, although I knew
1966	He were mine enemy? what friend of mine
1967	That had to him derived your anger, did I
1968	Continue in my liking? nay, gave notice
1969	He was from thence discharged. Sir, call to mind
1970	That I have been your wife, in this obedience,
1971	Upward of twenty years, and have been blest
1972	With many children by you: if, in the course
1973	And process of this time, you can report,
1974	And prove it too, against mine honour aught,
1975	My bond to wedlock, or my love and duty,
1976	Against your sacred person, in God's name,
1977	Turn me away; and let the foul'st contempt
1978	Shut door upon me, and so give me up
1979	To the sharp'st kind of justice. Please you sir,
1980	The king, your father, was reputed for
1981	A prince most prudent, of an excellent
1982	And unmatch'd wit and judgment: Ferdinand,
1983	My father, king of Spain, was reckon'd one
1984	The wisest prince that there had reign'd by many
1985	A year before: it is not to be question'd
1986	That they had gather'd a wise council to them
1987	Of every realm, that did debate this business,
1988	Who deem'd our marriage lawful: wherefore I humbly
1989	Beseech you, sir, to spare me, till I may
1990	Be by my friends in Spain advised; whose counsel
1991	I will implore: if not, i' the name of God,
1992	Your pleasure be fulfill'd!
1993	
1994	CARDINAL WOLSEY	You have here, lady,
1995	And of your choice, these reverend fathers; men
1996	Of singular integrity and learning,
1997	Yea, the elect o' the land, who are assembled
1998	To plead your cause: it shall be therefore bootless
1999	That longer you desire the court; as well
2000	For your own quiet, as to rectify
2001	What is unsettled in the king.
2002	
2003	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	His grace
2004	Hath spoken well and justly: therefore, madam,
2005	It's fit this royal session do proceed;
2006	And that, without delay, their arguments
2007	Be now produced and heard.
2008	
2009	QUEEN KATHARINE	Lord cardinal,
2010	To you I speak.
2011	
2012	CARDINAL WOLSEY	                  Your pleasure, madam?
2013	
2014	QUEEN KATHARINE	Sir,
2015	I am about to weep; but, thinking that
2016	We are a queen, or long have dream'd so, certain
2017	The daughter of a king, my drops of tears
2018	I'll turn to sparks of fire.
2019	
2020	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Be patient yet.
2021	
2022	QUEEN KATHARINE	I will, when you are humble; nay, before,
2023	Or God will punish me. I do believe,
2024	Induced by potent circumstances, that
2025	You are mine enemy, and make my challenge
2026	You shall not be my judge: for it is you
2027	Have blown this coal betwixt my lord and me;
2028	Which God's dew quench! Therefore I say again,
2029	I utterly abhor, yea, from my soul
2030	Refuse you for my judge; whom, yet once more,
2031	I hold my most malicious foe, and think not
2032	At all a friend to truth.
2033	
2034	CARDINAL WOLSEY	I do profess
2035	You speak not like yourself; who ever yet
2036	Have stood to charity, and display'd the effects
2037	Of disposition gentle, and of wisdom
2038	O'ertopping woman's power. Madam, you do me wrong:
2039	I have no spleen against you; nor injustice
2040	For you or any: how far I have proceeded,
2041	Or how far further shall, is warranted
2042	By a commission from the consistory,
2043	Yea, the whole consistory of Rome. You charge me
2044	That I have blown this coal: I do deny it:
2045	The king is present: if it be known to him
2046	That I gainsay my deed, how may he wound,
2047	And worthily, my falsehood! yea, as much
2048	As you have done my truth. If he know
2049	That I am free of your report, he knows
2050	I am not of your wrong. Therefore in him
2051	It lies to cure me: and the cure is, to
2052	Remove these thoughts from you: the which before
2053	His highness shall speak in, I do beseech
2054	You, gracious madam, to unthink your speaking
2055	And to say so no more.
2056	
2057	QUEEN KATHARINE	My lord, my lord,
2058	I am a simple woman, much too weak
2059	To oppose your cunning. You're meek and
2060	humble-mouth'd;
2061	You sign your place and calling, in full seeming,
2062	With meekness and humility; but your heart
2063	Is cramm'd with arrogancy, spleen, and pride.
2064	You have, by fortune and his highness' favours,
2065	Gone slightly o'er low steps and now are mounted
2066	Where powers are your retainers, and your words,
2067	Domestics to you, serve your will as't please
2068	Yourself pronounce their office. I must tell you,
2069	You tender more your person's honour than
2070	Your high profession spiritual: that again
2071	I do refuse you for my judge; and here,
2072	Before you all, appeal unto the pope,
2073	To bring my whole cause 'fore his holiness,
2074	And to be judged by him.
2075	
2076	[She curtsies to KING HENRY VIII, and offers to depart]
2077	
2078	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	The queen is obstinate,
2079	Stubborn to justice, apt to accuse it, and
2080	Disdainful to be tried by't: 'tis not well.
2081	She's going away.
2082	
2083	KING HENRY VIII	Call her again.
2084	
2085	Crier	Katharine Queen of England, come into the court.
2086	
2087	GRIFFITH	Madam, you are call'd back.
2088	
2089	QUEEN KATHARINE	What need you note it? pray you, keep your way:
2090	When you are call'd, return. Now, the Lord help,
2091	They vex me past my patience! Pray you, pass on:
2092	I will not tarry; no, nor ever more
2093	Upon this business my appearance make
2094	In any of their courts.
2095	
2096	[Exeunt QUEEN KATHARINE and her Attendants]
2097	
2098	KING HENRY VIII	Go thy ways, Kate:
2099	That man i' the world who shall report he has
2100	A better wife, let him in nought be trusted,
2101	For speaking false in that: thou art, alone,
2102	If thy rare qualities, sweet gentleness,
2103	Thy meekness saint-like, wife-like government,
2104	Obeying in commanding, and thy parts
2105	Sovereign and pious else, could speak thee out,
2106	The queen of earthly queens: she's noble born;
2107	And, like her true nobility, she has
2108	Carried herself towards me.
2109	
2110	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Most gracious sir,
2111	In humblest manner I require your highness,
2112	That it shall please you to declare, in hearing
2113	Of all these ears,--for where I am robb'd and bound,
2114	There must I be unloosed, although not there
2115	At once and fully satisfied,--whether ever I
2116	Did broach this business to your highness; or
2117	Laid any scruple in your way, which might
2118	Induce you to the question on't? or ever
2119	Have to you, but with thanks to God for such
2120	A royal lady, spake one the least word that might
2121	Be to the prejudice of her present state,
2122	Or touch of her good person?
2123	
2124	KING HENRY VIII	My lord cardinal,
2125	I do excuse you; yea, upon mine honour,
2126	I free you from't. You are not to be taught
2127	That you have many enemies, that know not
2128	Why they are so, but, like to village-curs,
2129	Bark when their fellows do: by some of these
2130	The queen is put in anger. You're excused:
2131	But will you be more justified? You ever
2132	Have wish'd the sleeping of this business; never desired
2133	It to be stirr'd; but oft have hinder'd, oft,
2134	The passages made toward it: on my honour,
2135	I speak my good lord cardinal to this point,
2136	And thus far clear him. Now, what moved me to't,
2137	I will be bold with time and your attention:
2138	Then mark the inducement. Thus it came; give heed to't:
2139	My conscience first received a tenderness,
2140	Scruple, and prick, on certain speeches utter'd
2141	By the Bishop of Bayonne, then French ambassador;
2142	Who had been hither sent on the debating
2143	A marriage 'twixt the Duke of Orleans and
2144	Our daughter Mary: i' the progress of this business,
2145	Ere a determinate resolution, he,
2146	I mean the bishop, did require a respite;
2147	Wherein he might the king his lord advertise
2148	Whether our daughter were legitimate,
2149	Respecting this our marriage with the dowager,
2150	Sometimes our brother's wife. This respite shook
2151	The bosom of my conscience, enter'd me,
2152	Yea, with a splitting power, and made to tremble
2153	The region of my breast; which forced such way,
2154	That many mazed considerings did throng
2155	And press'd in with this caution. First, methought
2156	I stood not in the smile of heaven; who had
2157	Commanded nature, that my lady's womb,
2158	If it conceived a male child by me, should
2159	Do no more offices of life to't than
2160	The grave does to the dead; for her male issue
2161	Or died where they were made, or shortly after
2162	This world had air'd them: hence I took a thought,
2163	This was a judgment on me; that my kingdom,
2164	Well worthy the best heir o' the world, should not
2165	Be gladded in't by me: then follows, that
2166	I weigh'd the danger which my realms stood in
2167	By this my issue's fail; and that gave to me
2168	Many a groaning throe. Thus hulling in
2169	The wild sea of my conscience, I did steer
2170	Toward this remedy, whereupon we are
2171	Now present here together: that's to say,
2172	I meant to rectify my conscience,--which
2173	I then did feel full sick, and yet not well,--
2174	By all the reverend fathers of the land
2175	And doctors learn'd: first I began in private
2176	With you, my Lord of Lincoln; you remember
2177	How under my oppression I did reek,
2178	When I first moved you.
2179	
2180	LINCOLN	Very well, my liege.
2181	
2182	KING HENRY VIII	I have spoke long: be pleased yourself to say
2183	How far you satisfied me.
2184	
2185	LINCOLN	So please your highness,
2186	The question did at first so stagger me,
2187	Bearing a state of mighty moment in't
2188	And consequence of dread, that I committed
2189	The daring'st counsel which I had to doubt;
2190	And did entreat your highness to this course
2191	Which you are running here.
2192	
2193	KING HENRY VIII	I then moved you,
2194	My Lord of Canterbury; and got your leave
2195	To make this present summons: unsolicited
2196	I left no reverend person in this court;
2197	But by particular consent proceeded
2198	Under your hands and seals: therefore, go on:
2199	For no dislike i' the world against the person
2200	Of the good queen, but the sharp thorny points
2201	Of my alleged reasons, drive this forward:
2202	Prove but our marriage lawful, by my life
2203	And kingly dignity, we are contented
2204	To wear our mortal state to come with her,
2205	Katharine our queen, before the primest creature
2206	That's paragon'd o' the world.
2207	
2208	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	So please your highness,
2209	The queen being absent, 'tis a needful fitness
2210	That we adjourn this court till further day:
2211	Meanwhile must be an earnest motion
2212	Made to the queen, to call back her appeal
2213	She intends unto his holiness.
2214	
2215	KING HENRY VIII	[Aside]	I may perceive
2216	These cardinals trifle with me: I abhor
2217	This dilatory sloth and tricks of Rome.
2218	My learn'd and well-beloved servant, Cranmer,
2219	Prithee, return: with thy approach, I know,
2220	My comfort comes along. Break up the court:
2221	I say, set on.
2222	
2223	[Exeunt in manner as they entered]

2231	ACT III
2232	
2233	
2234	
2235	SCENE I	London. QUEEN KATHARINE's apartments.
2236	
2237	
2238	[Enter QUEEN KATHARINE and her Women, as at work]
2239	
2240	QUEEN KATHARINE	Take thy lute, wench: my soul grows sad with troubles;
2241	Sing, and disperse 'em, if thou canst: leave working.
2242	[SONG]
2243	
2244	Orpheus with his lute made trees,
2245	And the mountain tops that freeze,
2246	Bow themselves when he did sing:
2247	To his music plants and flowers
2248	Ever sprung; as sun and showers
2249	There had made a lasting spring.
2250	
2251	Every thing that heard him play,
2252	Even the billows of the sea,
2253	Hung their heads, and then lay by.
2254	In sweet music is such art,
2255	Killing care and grief of heart
2256	Fall asleep, or hearing, die.
2257	
2258	[Enter a Gentleman]
2259	
2260	QUEEN KATHARINE	How now!
2261	
2262	Gentleman	An't please your grace, the two great cardinals
2263	Wait in the presence.
2264	
2265	QUEEN KATHARINE	Would they speak with me?
2266	
2267	Gentleman	They will'd me say so, madam.
2268	
2269	QUEEN KATHARINE	Pray their graces
2270	To come near.
2271	
2272	[Exit Gentleman]
2273	
2274	What can be their business
2275	With me, a poor weak woman, fall'n from favour?
2276	I do not like their coming. Now I think on't,
2277	They should be good men; their affairs as righteous:
2278	But all hoods make not monks.
2279	
2280	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CARDINAL CAMPEIUS]
2281	
2282	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Peace to your highness!
2283	
2284	QUEEN KATHARINE	Your graces find me here part of a housewife,
2285	I would be all, against the worst may happen.
2286	What are your pleasures with me, reverend lords?
2287	
2288	CARDINAL WOLSEY	May it please you noble madam, to withdraw
2289	Into your private chamber, we shall give you
2290	The full cause of our coming.
2291	
2292	QUEEN KATHARINE	Speak it here:
2293	There's nothing I have done yet, o' my conscience,
2294	Deserves a corner: would all other women
2295	Could speak this with as free a soul as I do!
2296	My lords, I care not, so much I am happy
2297	Above a number, if my actions
2298	Were tried by every tongue, every eye saw 'em,
2299	Envy and base opinion set against 'em,
2300	I know my life so even. If your business
2301	Seek me out, and that way I am wife in,
2302	Out with it boldly: truth loves open dealing.
2303	
2304	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Tanta est erga te mentis integritas, regina
2305	serenissima,--
2306	
2307	QUEEN KATHARINE	O, good my lord, no Latin;
2308	I am not such a truant since my coming,
2309	As not to know the language I have lived in:
2310	A strange tongue makes my cause more strange,
2311	suspicious;
2312	Pray, speak in English: here are some will thank you,
2313	If you speak truth, for their poor mistress' sake;
2314	Believe me, she has had much wrong: lord cardinal,
2315	The willing'st sin I ever yet committed
2316	May be absolved in English.
2317	
2318	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Noble lady,
2319	I am sorry my integrity should breed,
2320	And service to his majesty and you,
2321	So deep suspicion, where all faith was meant.
2322	We come not by the way of accusation,
2323	To taint that honour every good tongue blesses,
2324	Nor to betray you any way to sorrow,
2325	You have too much, good lady; but to know
2326	How you stand minded in the weighty difference
2327	Between the king and you; and to deliver,
2328	Like free and honest men, our just opinions
2329	And comforts to your cause.
2330	
2331	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Most honour'd madam,
2332	My Lord of York, out of his noble nature,
2333	Zeal and obedience he still bore your grace,
2334	Forgetting, like a good man your late censure
2335	Both of his truth and him, which was too far,
2336	Offers, as I do, in a sign of peace,
2337	His service and his counsel.
2338	
2339	QUEEN KATHARINE	[Aside]	To betray me.--
2340	My lords, I thank you both for your good wills;
2341	Ye speak like honest men; pray God, ye prove so!
2342	But how to make ye suddenly an answer,
2343	In such a point of weight, so near mine honour,--
2344	More near my life, I fear,--with my weak wit,
2345	And to such men of gravity and learning,
2346	In truth, I know not. I was set at work
2347	Among my maids: full little, God knows, looking
2348	Either for such men or such business.
2349	For her sake that I have been,--for I feel
2350	The last fit of my greatness,--good your graces,
2351	Let me have time and counsel for my cause:
2352	Alas, I am a woman, friendless, hopeless!
2353	
2354	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Madam, you wrong the king's love with these fears:
2355	Your hopes and friends are infinite.
2356	
2357	QUEEN KATHARINE	In England
2358	But little for my profit: can you think, lords,
2359	That any Englishman dare give me counsel?
2360	Or be a known friend, 'gainst his highness' pleasure,
2361	Though he be grown so desperate to be honest,
2362	And live a subject? Nay, forsooth, my friends,
2363	They that must weigh out my afflictions,
2364	They that my trust must grow to, live not here:
2365	They are, as all my other comforts, far hence
2366	In mine own country, lords.
2367	
2368	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	I would your grace
2369	Would leave your griefs, and take my counsel.
2370	
2371	QUEEN KATHARINE	How, sir?
2372	
2373	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Put your main cause into the king's protection;
2374	He's loving and most gracious: 'twill be much
2375	Both for your honour better and your cause;
2376	For if the trial of the law o'ertake ye,
2377	You'll part away disgraced.
2378	
2379	CARDINAL WOLSEY	He tells you rightly.
2380	
2381	QUEEN KATHARINE	Ye tell me what ye wish for both,--my ruin:
2382	Is this your Christian counsel? out upon ye!
2383	Heaven is above all yet; there sits a judge
2384	That no king can corrupt.
2385	
2386	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Your rage mistakes us.
2387	
2388	QUEEN KATHARINE	The more shame for ye: holy men I thought ye,
2389	Upon my soul, two reverend cardinal virtues;
2390	But cardinal sins and hollow hearts I fear ye:
2391	Mend 'em, for shame, my lords. Is this your comfort?
2392	The cordial that ye bring a wretched lady,
2393	A woman lost among ye, laugh'd at, scorn'd?
2394	I will not wish ye half my miseries;
2395	I have more charity: but say, I warn'd ye;
2396	Take heed, for heaven's sake, take heed, lest at once
2397	The burthen of my sorrows fall upon ye.
2398	
2399	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Madam, this is a mere distraction;
2400	You turn the good we offer into envy.
2401	
2402	QUEEN KATHARINE	Ye turn me into nothing: woe upon ye
2403	And all such false professors! would you have me--
2404	If you have any justice, any pity;
2405	If ye be any thing but churchmen's habits--
2406	Put my sick cause into his hands that hates me?
2407	Alas, has banish'd me his bed already,
2408	His love, too long ago! I am old, my lords,
2409	And all the fellowship I hold now with him
2410	Is only my obedience. What can happen
2411	To me above this wretchedness? all your studies
2412	Make me a curse like this.
2413	
2414	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Your fears are worse.
2415	
2416	QUEEN KATHARINE	Have I lived thus long--let me speak myself,
2417	Since virtue finds no friends--a wife, a true one?
2418	A woman, I dare say without vain-glory,
2419	Never yet branded with suspicion?
2420	Have I with all my full affections
2421	Still met the king? loved him next heaven?
2422	obey'd him?
2423	Been, out of fondness, superstitious to him?
2424	Almost forgot my prayers to content him?
2425	And am I thus rewarded? 'tis not well, lords.
2426	Bring me a constant woman to her husband,
2427	One that ne'er dream'd a joy beyond his pleasure;
2428	And to that woman, when she has done most,
2429	Yet will I add an honour, a great patience.
2430	
2431	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Madam, you wander from the good we aim at.
2432	
2433	QUEEN KATHARINE	My lord, I dare not make myself so guilty,
2434	To give up willingly that noble title
2435	Your master wed me to: nothing but death
2436	Shall e'er divorce my dignities.
2437	
2438	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Pray, hear me.
2439	
2440	QUEEN KATHARINE	Would I had never trod this English earth,
2441	Or felt the flatteries that grow upon it!
2442	Ye have angels' faces, but heaven knows your hearts.
2443	What will become of me now, wretched lady!
2444	I am the most unhappy woman living.
2445	Alas, poor wenches, where are now your fortunes!
2446	Shipwreck'd upon a kingdom, where no pity,
2447	No friend, no hope; no kindred weep for me;
2448	Almost no grave allow'd me: like the lily,
2449	That once was mistress of the field and flourish'd,
2450	I'll hang my head and perish.
2451	
2452	CARDINAL WOLSEY	If your grace
2453	Could but be brought to know our ends are honest,
2454	You'ld feel more comfort: why should we, good lady,
2455	Upon what cause, wrong you? alas, our places,
2456	The way of our profession is against it:
2457	We are to cure such sorrows, not to sow 'em.
2458	For goodness' sake, consider what you do;
2459	How you may hurt yourself, ay, utterly
2460	Grow from the king's acquaintance, by this carriage.
2461	The hearts of princes kiss obedience,
2462	So much they love it; but to stubborn spirits
2463	They swell, and grow as terrible as storms.
2464	I know you have a gentle, noble temper,
2465	A soul as even as a calm: pray, think us
2466	Those we profess, peace-makers, friends, and servants.
2467	
2468	CARDINAL CAMPEIUS	Madam, you'll find it so. You wrong your virtues
2469	With these weak women's fears: a noble spirit,
2470	As yours was put into you, ever casts
2471	Such doubts, as false coin, from it. The king loves you;
2472	Beware you lose it not: for us, if you please
2473	To trust us in your business, we are ready
2474	To use our utmost studies in your service.
2475	
2476	QUEEN KATHARINE	Do what ye will, my lords: and, pray, forgive me,
2477	If I have used myself unmannerly;
2478	You know I am a woman, lacking wit
2479	To make a seemly answer to such persons.
2480	Pray, do my service to his majesty:
2481	He has my heart yet; and shall have my prayers
2482	While I shall have my life. Come, reverend fathers,
2483	Bestow your counsels on me: she now begs,
2484	That little thought, when she set footing here,
2485	She should have bought her dignities so dear.
2486

2497	
2498	
2499	SCENE II	Ante-chamber to KING HENRY VIII's apartment.
2500	
2501	
2502	[Enter NORFOLK, SUFFOLK, SURREY, and Chamberlain]
2503	
2504	NORFOLK	If you will now unite in your complaints,
2505	And force them with a constancy, the cardinal
2506	Cannot stand under them: if you omit
2507	The offer of this time, I cannot promise
2508	But that you shall sustain moe new disgraces,
2509	With these you bear already.
2510	
2511	SURREY	I am joyful
2512	To meet the least occasion that may give me
2513	Remembrance of my father-in-law, the duke,
2514	To be revenged on him.
2515	
2516	SUFFOLK	Which of the peers
2517	Have uncontemn'd gone by him, or at least
2518	Strangely neglected? when did he regard
2519	The stamp of nobleness in any person
2520	Out of himself?
2521	
2522	Chamberlain	                  My lords, you speak your pleasures:
2523	What he deserves of you and me I know;
2524	What we can do to him, though now the time
2525	Gives way to us, I much fear. If you cannot
2526	Bar his access to the king, never attempt
2527	Any thing on him; for he hath a witchcraft
2528	Over the king in's tongue.
2529	
2530	NORFOLK	O, fear him not;
2531	His spell in that is out: the king hath found
2532	Matter against him that for ever mars
2533	The honey of his language. No, he's settled,
2534	Not to come off, in his displeasure.
2535	
2536	SURREY	Sir,
2537	I should be glad to hear such news as this
2538	Once every hour.
2539	
2540	NORFOLK	                  Believe it, this is true:
2541	In the divorce his contrary proceedings
2542	Are all unfolded wherein he appears
2543	As I would wish mine enemy.
2544	
2545	SURREY	How came
2546	His practises to light?
2547	
2548	SUFFOLK	Most strangely.
2549	
2550	SURREY	O, how, how?
2551	
2552	SUFFOLK	The cardinal's letters to the pope miscarried,
2553	And came to the eye o' the king: wherein was read,
2554	How that the cardinal did entreat his holiness
2555	To stay the judgment o' the divorce; for if
2556	It did take place, 'I do,' quoth he, 'perceive
2557	My king is tangled in affection to
2558	A creature of the queen's, Lady Anne Bullen.'
2559	
2560	SURREY	Has the king this?
2561	
2562	SUFFOLK	                  Believe it.
2563	
2564	SURREY	Will this work?
2565	
2566	Chamberlain	The king in this perceives him, how he coasts
2567	And hedges his own way. But in this point
2568	All his tricks founder, and he brings his physic
2569	After his patient's death: the king already
2570	Hath married the fair lady.
2571	
2572	SURREY	Would he had!
2573	
2574	SUFFOLK	May you be happy in your wish, my lord
2575	For, I profess, you have it.
2576	
2577	SURREY	Now, all my joy
2578	Trace the conjunction!
2579	
2580	SUFFOLK	My amen to't!
2581	
2582	NORFOLK	All men's!
2583	
2584	SUFFOLK	There's order given for her coronation:
2585	Marry, this is yet but young, and may be left
2586	To some ears unrecounted. But, my lords,
2587	She is a gallant creature, and complete
2588	In mind and feature: I persuade me, from her
2589	Will fall some blessing to this land, which shall
2590	In it be memorised.
2591	
2592	SURREY	But, will the king
2593	Digest this letter of the cardinal's?
2594	The Lord forbid!
2595	
2596	NORFOLK	                  Marry, amen!
2597	
2598	SUFFOLK	No, no;
2599	There be moe wasps that buzz about his nose
2600	Will make this sting the sooner. Cardinal Campeius
2601	Is stol'n away to Rome; hath ta'en no leave;
2602	Has left the cause o' the king unhandled; and
2603	Is posted, as the agent of our cardinal,
2604	To second all his plot. I do assure you
2605	The king cried Ha! at this.
2606	
2607	Chamberlain	Now, God incense him,
2608	And let him cry Ha! louder!
2609	
2610	NORFOLK	But, my lord,
2611	When returns Cranmer?
2612	
2613	SUFFOLK	He is return'd in his opinions; which
2614	Have satisfied the king for his divorce,
2615	Together with all famous colleges
2616	Almost in Christendom: shortly, I believe,
2617	His second marriage shall be publish'd, and
2618	Her coronation. Katharine no more
2619	Shall be call'd queen, but princess dowager
2620	And widow to Prince Arthur.
2621	
2622	NORFOLK	This same Cranmer's
2623	A worthy fellow, and hath ta'en much pain
2624	In the king's business.
2625	
2626	SUFFOLK	He has; and we shall see him
2627	For it an archbishop.
2628	
2629	NORFOLK	So I hear.
2630	
2631	SUFFOLK	'Tis so.
2632	The cardinal!
2633	
2634	[Enter CARDINAL WOLSEY and CROMWELL]
2635	
2636	NORFOLK	                  Observe, observe, he's moody.
2637	
2638	CARDINAL WOLSEY	The packet, Cromwell.
2639	Gave't you the king?
2640	
2641	CROMWELL	To his own hand, in's bedchamber.
2642	
2643	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Look'd he o' the inside of the paper?
2644	
2645	CROMWELL	Presently
2646	He did unseal them: and the first he view'd,
2647	He did it with a serious mind; a heed
2648	Was in his countenance. You he bade
2649	Attend him here this morning.
2650	
2651	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Is he ready
2652	To come abroad?
2653	
2654	CROMWELL	                  I think, by this he is.
2655	
2656	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Leave me awhile.
2657	
2658	[Exit CROMWELL]
2659	
2660	[Aside]

2662	It shall be to the Duchess of Alencon,
2663	The French king's sister: he shall marry her.
2664	Anne Bullen! No; I'll no Anne Bullens for him:
2665	There's more in't than fair visage. Bullen!
2666	No, we'll no Bullens. Speedily I wish
2667	To hear from Rome. The Marchioness of Pembroke!
2668	
2669	NORFOLK	He's discontented.
2670	
2671	SUFFOLK	                  May be, he hears the king
2672	Does whet his anger to him.
2673	
2674	SURREY	Sharp enough,
2675	Lord, for thy justice!
2676	
2677	CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside]  The late queen's gentlewoman,
2678	a knight's daughter,
2679	To be her mistress' mistress! the queen's queen!
2680	This candle burns not clear: 'tis I must snuff it;
2681	Then out it goes. What though I know her virtuous
2682	And well deserving? yet I know her for
2683	A spleeny Lutheran; and not wholesome to
2684	Our cause, that she should lie i' the bosom of
2685	Our hard-ruled king. Again, there is sprung up
2686	An heretic, an arch one, Cranmer; one
2687	Hath crawl'd into the favour of the king,
2688	And is his oracle.
2689	
2690	NORFOLK	                  He is vex'd at something.
2691	
2692	SURREY	I would 'twere something that would fret the string,
2693	The master-cord on's heart!
2694	
2695	[Enter KING HENRY VIII, reading of a schedule, and LOVELL]
2696	
2697	SUFFOLK	The king, the king!
2698	
2699	KING HENRY VIII	What piles of wealth hath he accumulated
2700	To his own portion! and what expense by the hour
2701	Seems to flow from him! How, i' the name of thrift,
2702	Does he rake this together! Now, my lords,
2703	Saw you the cardinal?
2704	
2705	NORFOLK	My lord, we have
2706	Stood here observing him: some strange commotion
2707	Is in his brain: he bites his lip, and starts;
2708	Stops on a sudden, looks upon the ground,
2709	Then lays his finger on his temple, straight
2710	Springs out into fast gait; then stops again,
2711	Strikes his breast hard, and anon he casts
2712	His eye against the moon: in most strange postures
2713	We have seen him set himself.
2714	
2715	KING HENRY VIII	It may well be;
2716	There is a mutiny in's mind. This morning
2717	Papers of state he sent me to peruse,
2718	As I required: and wot you what I found
2719	There,--on my conscience, put unwittingly?
2720	Forsooth, an inventory, thus importing;
2721	The several parcels of his plate, his treasure,
2722	Rich stuffs, and ornaments of household; which
2723	I find at such proud rate, that it out-speaks
2724	Possession of a subject.
2725	
2726	NORFOLK	It's heaven's will:
2727	Some spirit put this paper in the packet,
2728	To bless your eye withal.
2729	
2730	KING HENRY VIII	If we did think
2731	His contemplation were above the earth,
2732	And fix'd on spiritual object, he should still
2733	Dwell in his musings: but I am afraid
2734	His thinkings are below the moon, not worth
2735	His serious considering.
2736	
2737	[King HENRY VIII takes his seat; whispers LOVELL,
2738	who goes to CARDINAL WOLSEY]
2739	
2740	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Heaven forgive me!
2741	Ever God bless your highness!
2742	
2743	KING HENRY VIII	Good my lord,
2744	You are full of heavenly stuff, and bear the inventory
2745	Of your best graces in your mind; the which
2746	You were now running o'er: you have scarce time
2747	To steal from spiritual leisure a brief span
2748	To keep your earthly audit: sure, in that
2749	I deem you an ill husband, and am glad
2750	To have you therein my companion.
2751	
2752	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Sir,
2753	For holy offices I have a time; a time
2754	To think upon the part of business which
2755	I bear i' the state; and nature does require
2756	Her times of preservation, which perforce
2757	I, her frail son, amongst my brethren mortal,
2758	Must give my tendence to.
2759	
2760	KING HENRY VIII	You have said well.
2761	
2762	CARDINAL WOLSEY	And ever may your highness yoke together,
2763	As I will lend you cause, my doing well
2764	With my well saying!
2765	
2766	KING HENRY VIII	'Tis well said again;
2767	And 'tis a kind of good deed to say well:
2768	And yet words are no deeds. My father loved you:
2769	His said he did; and with his deed did crown
2770	His word upon you. Since I had my office,
2771	I have kept you next my heart; have not alone
2772	Employ'd you where high profits might come home,
2773	But pared my present havings, to bestow
2774	My bounties upon you.
2775	
2776	CARDINAL WOLSEY	[Aside]             What should this mean?
2777	
2778	SURREY	[Aside]  The Lord increase this business!
2779	
2780	KING HENRY VIII	Have I not made you,
2781	The prime man of the state? I pray you, tell me,
2782	If what I now pronounce you have found true:
2783	And, if you may confess it, say withal,
2784	If you are bound to us or no. What say you?
2785	
2786	CARDINAL WOLSEY	My sovereign, I confess your royal graces,
2787	Shower'd on me daily, have been more than could
2788	My studied purposes requite; which went
2789	Beyond all man's endeavours: my endeavours
2790	Have ever come too short of my desires,
2791	Yet filed with my abilities: mine own ends
2792	Have been mine so that evermore they pointed
2793	To the good of your most sacred person and
2794	The profit of the state. For your great graces
2795	Heap'd upon me, poor undeserver, I
2796	Can nothing render but allegiant thanks,
2797	My prayers to heaven for you, my loyalty,
2798	Which ever has and ever shall be growing,
2799	Till death, that winter, kill it.
2800	
2801	KING HENRY VIII	Fairly answer'd;
2802	A loyal and obedient subject is
2803	Therein illustrated: the honour of it
2804	Does pay the act of it; as, i' the contrary,
2805	The foulness is the punishment. I presume
2806	That, as my hand has open'd bounty to you,
2807	My heart dropp'd love, my power rain'd honour, more
2808	On you than any; so your hand and heart,
2809	Your brain, and every function of your power,
2810	Should, notwithstanding that your bond of duty,
2811	As 'twere in love's particular, be more
2812	To me, your friend, than any.
2813	
2814	CARDINAL WOLSEY	I do profess
2815	That for your highness' good I ever labour'd
2816	More than mine own; that am, have, and will be--
2817	Though all the world should crack their duty to you,
2818	And throw it from their soul; though perils did
2819	Abound, as thick as thought could make 'em, and
2820	Appear in forms more horrid,--yet my duty,
2821	As doth a rock against the chiding flood,
2822	Should the approach of this wild river break,
2823	And stand unshaken yours.
2824	
2825	KING HENRY VIII	'Tis nobly spoken:
2826	Take notice, lords, he has a loyal breast,
2827	For you have seen him open't. Read o'er this;
2828	
2829	[Giving him papers]
2830	
2831	And after, this: and then to breakfast with
2832	What appetite you have.
2833	
2834	[Exit KING HENRY VIII, frowning upon CARDINAL WOLSEY:
2835	the Nobles throng after him, smiling and whispering]
2836	
2837	CARDINAL WOLSEY	What should this mean?
2838	What sudden anger's this? how have I reap'd it?
2839	He parted frowning from me, as if ruin
2840	Leap'd from his eyes: so looks the chafed lion
2841	Upon the daring huntsman that has gall'd him;
2842	Then makes him nothing. I must read this paper;
2843	I fear, the story of his anger. 'Tis so;
2844	This paper has undone me: 'tis the account
2845	Of all that world of wealth I have drawn together
2846	For mine own ends; indeed, to gain the popedom,
2847	And fee my friends in Rome. O negligence!
2848	Fit for a fool to fall by: what cross devil
2849	Made me put this main secret in the packet
2850	I sent the king? Is there no way to cure this?
2851	No new device to beat this from his brains?
2852	I know 'twill stir him strongly; yet I know
2853	A way, if it take right, in spite of fortune
2854	Will bring me off again. What's this? 'To the Pope!'
2855	The letter, as I live, with all the business
2856	I writ to's holiness. Nay then, farewell!
2857	I have touch'd the highest point of all my greatness;
2858	And, from that full meridian of my glory,
2859	I haste now to my setting: I shall fall
2860	Like a bright exhalation m the evening,
2861	And no man see me more.
2862	
2863	[Re-enter to CARDINAL WOLSEY, NORFOLK and SUFFOLK, SURREY,
2864	and the Chamberlain]
2865	
2866	NORFOLK	Hear the king's pleasure, cardinal: who commands you
2867	To render up the great seal presently
2868	Into our hands; and to confine yourself
2869	To Asher House, my Lord of Winchester's,
2870	Till you hear further from his highness.
2871	
2872	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Stay:
2873	Where's your commission, lords? words cannot carry
2874	Authority so weighty.
2875	
2876	SUFFOLK	Who dare cross 'em,
2877	Bearing the king's will from his mouth expressly?
2878	
2879	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Till I find more than will or words to do it,
2880	I mean your malice, know, officious lords,
2881	I dare and must deny it. Now I feel
2882	Of what coarse metal ye are moulded, envy:
2883	How eagerly ye follow my disgraces,
2884	As if it fed ye! and how sleek and wanton
2885	Ye appear in every thing may bring my ruin!
2886	Follow your envious courses, men of malice;
2887	You have Christian warrant for 'em, and, no doubt,
2888	In time will find their fit rewards. That seal,
2889	You ask with such a violence, the king,
2890	Mine and your master, with his own hand gave me;
2891	Bade me enjoy it, with the place and honours,
2892	During my life; and, to confirm his goodness,
2893	Tied it by letters-patents: now, who'll take it?
2894	
2895	SURREY	The king, that gave it.
2896	
2897	CARDINAL WOLSEY	It must be himself, then.
2898	
2899	SURREY	Thou art a proud traitor, priest.
2900	
2901	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Proud lord, thou liest:
2902	Within these forty hours Surrey durst better
2903	Have burnt that tongue than said so.
2904	
2905	SURREY	Thy ambition,
2906	Thou scarlet sin, robb'd this bewailing land
2907	Of noble Buckingham, my father-in-law:
2908	The heads of all thy brother cardinals,
2909	With thee and all thy best parts bound together,
2910	Weigh'd not a hair of his. Plague of your policy!
2911	You sent me deputy for Ireland;
2912	Far from his succor, from the king, from all
2913	That might have mercy on the fault thou gavest him;
2914	Whilst your great goodness, out of holy pity,
2915	Absolved him with an axe.
2916	
2917	CARDINAL WOLSEY	This, and all else
2918	This talking lord can lay upon my credit,
2919	I answer is most false. The duke by law
2920	Found his deserts: how innocent I was
2921	From any private malice in his end,
2922	His noble jury and foul cause can witness.
2923	If I loved many words, lord, I should tell you
2924	You have as little honesty as honour,
2925	That in the way of loyalty and truth
2926	Toward the king, my ever royal master,
2927	Dare mate a sounder man than Surrey can be,
2928	And all that love his follies.
2929	
2930	SURREY	By my soul,
2931	Your long coat, priest, protects you; thou
2932	shouldst feel
2933	My sword i' the life-blood of thee else. My lords,
2934	Can ye endure to hear this arrogance?
2935	And from this fellow? if we live thus tamely,
2936	To be thus jaded by a piece of scarlet,
2937	Farewell nobility; let his grace go forward,
2938	And dare us with his cap like larks.
2939	
2940	CARDINAL WOLSEY	All goodness
2941	Is poison to thy stomach.
2942	
2943	SURREY	Yes, that goodness
2944	Of gleaning all the land's wealth into one,
2945	Into your own hands, cardinal, by extortion;
2946	The goodness of your intercepted packets
2947	You writ to the pope against the king: your goodness,
2948	Since you provoke me, shall be most notorious.
2949	My Lord of Norfolk, as you are truly noble,
2950	As you respect the common good, the state
2951	Of our despised nobility, our issues,
2952	Who, if he live, will scarce be gentlemen,
2953	Produce the grand sum of his sins, the articles
2954	Collected from his life. I'll startle you
2955	Worse than the scaring bell, when the brown wench
2956	Lay kissing in your arms, lord cardinal.
2957	
2958	CARDINAL WOLSEY	How much, methinks, I could despise this man,
2959	But that I am bound in charity against it!
2960	
2961	NORFOLK	Those articles, my lord, are in the king's hand:
2962	But, thus much, they are foul ones.
2963	
2964	CARDINAL WOLSEY	So much fairer
2965	And spotless shall mine innocence arise,
2966	When the king knows my truth.
2967	
2968	SURREY	This cannot save you:
2969	I thank my memory, I yet remember
2970	Some of these articles; and out they shall.
2971	Now, if you can blush and cry 'guilty,' cardinal,
2972	You'll show a little honesty.
2973	
2974	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Speak on, sir;
2975	I dare your worst objections: if I blush,
2976	It is to see a nobleman want manners.
2977	
2978	SURREY	I had rather want those than my head. Have at you!
2979	First, that, without the king's assent or knowledge,
2980	You wrought to be a legate; by which power
2981	You maim'd the jurisdiction of all bishops.
2982	
2983	NORFOLK	Then, that in all you writ to Rome, or else
2984	To foreign princes, 'Ego et Rex meus'
2985	Was still inscribed; in which you brought the king
2986	To be your servant.
2987	
2988	SUFFOLK	Then that, without the knowledge
2989	Either of king or council, when you went
2990	Ambassador to the emperor, you made bold
2991	To carry into Flanders the great seal.
2992	
2993	SURREY	Item, you sent a large commission
2994	To Gregory de Cassado, to conclude,
2995	Without the king's will or the state's allowance,
2996	A league between his highness and Ferrara.
2997	
2998	SUFFOLK	That, out of mere ambition, you have caused
2999	Your holy hat to be stamp'd on the king's coin.
3000	
3001	SURREY	Then that you have sent innumerable substance--
3002	By what means got, I leave to your own conscience--
3003	To furnish Rome, and to prepare the ways
3004	You have for dignities; to the mere undoing
3005	Of all the kingdom. Many more there are;
3006	Which, since they are of you, and odious,
3007	I will not taint my mouth with.
3008	
3009	Chamberlain	O my lord,
3010	Press not a falling man too far! 'tis virtue:
3011	His faults lie open to the laws; let them,
3012	Not you, correct him. My heart weeps to see him
3013	So little of his great self.
3014	
3015	SURREY	I forgive him.
3016	
3017	SUFFOLK	Lord cardinal, the king's further pleasure is,
3018	Because all those things you have done of late,
3019	By your power legatine, within this kingdom,
3020	Fall into the compass of a praemunire,
3021	That therefore such a writ be sued against you;
3022	To forfeit all your goods, lands, tenements,
3023	Chattels, and whatsoever, and to be
3024	Out of the king's protection. This is my charge.
3025	
3026	NORFOLK	And so we'll leave you to your meditations
3027	How to live better. For your stubborn answer
3028	About the giving back the great seal to us,
3029	The king shall know it, and, no doubt, shall thank you.
3030	So fare you well, my little good lord cardinal.
3031	
3032	[Exeunt all but CARDINAL WOLSEY]
3033	
3034	CARDINAL WOLSEY	So farewell to the little good you bear me.
3035	Farewell! a long farewell, to all my greatness!
3036	This is the state of man: to-day he puts forth
3037	The tender leaves of hopes; to-morrow blossoms,
3038	And bears his blushing honours thick upon him;
3039	The third day comes a frost, a killing frost,
3040	And, when he thinks, good easy man, full surely
3041	His greatness is a-ripening, nips his root,
3042	And then he falls, as I do. I have ventured,
3043	Like little wanton boys that swim on bladders,
3044	This many summers in a sea of glory,
3045	But far beyond my depth: my high-blown pride
3046	At length broke under me and now has left me,
3047	Weary and old with service, to the mercy
3048	Of a rude stream, that must for ever hide me.
3049	Vain pomp and glory of this world, I hate ye:
3050	I feel my heart new open'd. O, how wretched
3051	Is that poor man that hangs on princes' favours!
3052	There is, betwixt that smile we would aspire to,
3053	That sweet aspect of princes, and their ruin,
3054	More pangs and fears than wars or women have:
3055	And when he falls, he falls like Lucifer,
3056	Never to hope again.
3057	
3058	[Enter CROMWELL, and stands amazed]
3059	
3060	Why, how now, Cromwell!
3061	
3062	CROMWELL	I have no power to speak, sir.
3063	
3064	CARDINAL WOLSEY	What, amazed
3065	At my misfortunes? can thy spirit wonder
3066	A great man should decline? Nay, an you weep,
3067	I am fall'n indeed.
3068	
3069	CROMWELL	How does your grace?
3070	
3071	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Why, well;
3072	Never so truly happy, my good Cromwell.
3073	I know myself now; and I feel within me
3074	A peace above all earthly dignities,
3075	A still and quiet conscience. The king has cured me,
3076	I humbly thank his grace; and from these shoulders,
3077	These ruin'd pillars, out of pity, taken
3078	A load would sink a navy, too much honour:
3079	O, 'tis a burthen, Cromwell, 'tis a burthen
3080	Too heavy for a man that hopes for heaven!
3081	
3082	CROMWELL	I am glad your grace has made that right use of it.
3083	
3084	CARDINAL WOLSEY	I hope I have: I am able now, methinks,
3085	Out of a fortitude of soul I feel,
3086	To endure more miseries and greater far
3087	Than my weak-hearted enemies dare offer.
3088	What news abroad?
3089	
3090	CROMWELL	                  The heaviest and the worst
3091	Is your displeasure with the king.
3092	
3093	CARDINAL WOLSEY	God bless him!
3094	
3095	CROMWELL	The next is, that Sir Thomas More is chosen
3096	Lord chancellor in your place.
3097	
3098	CARDINAL WOLSEY	That's somewhat sudden:
3099	But he's a learned man. May he continue
3100	Long in his highness' favour, and do justice
3101	For truth's sake and his conscience; that his bones,
3102	When he has run his course and sleeps in blessings,
3103	May have a tomb of orphans' tears wept on em! What more?
3104	
3105	CROMWELL	That Cranmer is return'd with welcome,
3106	Install'd lord archbishop of Canterbury.
3107	
3108	CARDINAL WOLSEY	That's news indeed.
3109	
3110	CROMWELL	Last, that the Lady Anne,
3111	Whom the king hath in secrecy long married,
3112	This day was view'd in open as his queen,
3113	Going to chapel; and the voice is now
3114	Only about her coronation.
3115	
3116	CARDINAL WOLSEY	There was the weight that pull'd me down. O Cromwell,
3117	The king has gone beyond me: all my glories
3118	In that one woman I have lost for ever:
3119	No sun shall ever usher forth mine honours,
3120	Or gild again the noble troops that waited
3121	Upon my smiles. Go, get thee from me, Cromwell;
3122	I am a poor fall'n man, unworthy now
3123	To be thy lord and master: seek the king;
3124	That sun, I pray, may never set! I have told him
3125	What and how true thou art: he will advance thee;
3126	Some little memory of me will stir him--
3127	I know his noble nature--not to let
3128	Thy hopeful service perish too: good Cromwell,
3129	Neglect him not; make use now, and provide
3130	For thine own future safety.
3131	
3132	CROMWELL	O my lord,
3133	Must I, then, leave you? must I needs forego
3134	So good, so noble and so true a master?
3135	Bear witness, all that have not hearts of iron,
3136	With what a sorrow Cromwell leaves his lord.
3137	The king shall have my service: but my prayers
3138	For ever and for ever shall be yours.
3139	
3140	CARDINAL WOLSEY	Cromwell, I did not think to shed a tear
3141	In all my miseries; but thou hast forced me,
3142	Out of thy honest truth, to play the woman.
3143	Let's dry our eyes: and thus far hear me, Cromwell;
3144	And, when I am forgotten, as I shall be,
3145	And sleep in dull cold marble, where no mention
3146	Of me more must be heard of, say, I taught thee,
3147	Say, Wolsey, that once trod the ways of glory,
3148	And sounded all the depths and shoals of honour,
3149	Found thee a way, out of his wreck, to rise in;
3150	A sure and safe one, though thy master miss'd it.
3151	Mark but my fall, and that that ruin'd me.
3152	Cromwell, I charge thee, fling away ambition:
3153	By that sin fell the angels; how can man, then,
3154	The image of his Maker, hope to win by it?
3155	Love thyself last: cherish those hearts that hate thee;
3156	Corruption wins not more than honesty.
3157	Still in thy right hand carry gentle peace,
3158	To silence envious tongues. Be just, and fear not:
3159	Let all the ends thou aim'st at be thy country's,
3160	Thy God's, and truth's; then if thou fall'st,
3161	O Cromwell,
3162	Thou fall'st a blessed martyr! Serve the king;
3163	And,--prithee, lead me in:
3164	There take an inventory of all I have,
3165	To the last penny; 'tis the king's: my robe,
3166	And my integrity to heaven, is all
3167	I dare now call mine own. O Cromwell, Cromwell!
3168	Had I but served my God with half the zeal
3169	I served my king, he would not in mine age
3170	Have left me naked to mine enemies.
3171	
3172	CROMWELL	Good sir, have patience.
3173	
3174	CARDINAL WOLSEY	So I have. Farewell
3175	The hopes of court! my hopes in heaven do dwell.

3182	KING HENRY VIII
3183	
3184	
3185	ACT IV
3186	
3187	
3188	
3189	SCENE I	A street in Westminster.
3190	
3191	
3192	[Enter two Gentlemen, meeting one another]
3193	
3194	First Gentleman	You're well met once again.
3195	
3196	Second Gentleman	So are you.
3197	
3198	First Gentleman	You come to take your stand here, and behold
3199	The Lady Anne pass from her coronation?
3200	
3201	Second Gentleman	'Tis all my business. At our last encounter,
3202	The Duke of Buckingham came from his trial.
3203	
3204	First Gentleman	'Tis very true: but that time offer'd sorrow;
3205	This, general joy.
3206	
3207	Second Gentleman	'Tis well: the citizens,
3208	I am sure, have shown at full their royal minds--
3209	As, let 'em have their rights, they are ever forward--
3210	In celebration of this day with shows,
3211	Pageants and sights of honour.
3212	
3213	First Gentleman	Never greater,
3214	Nor, I'll assure you, better taken, sir.
3215	
3216	Second Gentleman	May I be bold to ask at what that contains,
3217	That paper in your hand?
3218	
3219	First Gentleman	Yes; 'tis the list
3220	Of those that claim their offices this day
3221	By custom of the coronation.
3222	The Duke of Suffolk is the first, and claims
3223	To be high-steward; next, the Duke of Norfolk,
3224	He to be earl marshal: you may read the rest.
3225	
3226	Second Gentleman	I thank you, sir: had I not known those customs,
3227	I should have been beholding to your paper.
3228	But, I beseech you, what's become of Katharine,
3229	The princess dowager? how goes her business?
3230	
3231	First Gentleman	That I can tell you too. The Archbishop
3232	Of Canterbury, accompanied with other
3233	Learned and reverend fathers of his order,
3234	Held a late court at Dunstable, six miles off
3235	From Ampthill where the princess lay; to which
3236	She was often cited by them, but appear'd not:
3237	And, to be short, for not appearance and
3238	The king's late scruple, by the main assent
3239	Of all these learned men she was divorced,
3240	And the late marriage made of none effect
3241	Since which she was removed to Kimbolton,
3242	Where she remains now sick.
3243	
3244	Second Gentleman	Alas, good lady!
3245	
3246	[Trumpets]
3247	
3248	The trumpets sound: stand close, the queen is coming.
3249	
3250	[Hautboys]
3251	
3252	[THE ORDER OF THE CORONATION]
3253	
3254	1. A lively flourish of Trumpets.
3255	
3256	2. Then, two Judges.
3257	
3258	3. Lord Chancellor, with the purse and mace
3259	before him.
3260	
3261	4. Choristers, singing.
3262	
3263	[Music]
3264	
3265	5. Mayor of London, bearing the mace. Then
3266	Garter, in his coat of arms, and on his
3267	head a gilt copper crown.
3268	
3269	6. Marquess Dorset, bearing a sceptre of gold,
3270	on his head a demi-coronal of gold. With
3271	him, SURREY, bearing the rod of silver with
3272	the dove, crowned with an earl's coronet.
3273	Collars of SS.
3274	
3275	7. SUFFOLK, in his robe of estate, his coronet
3276	on his head, bearing a long white wand, as
3277	high-steward. With him, NORFOLK, with the
3278	rod of marshalship, a coronet on his head.
3279	Collars of SS.
3280	
3281	8. A canopy borne by four of the Cinque-ports;
3282	under it, QUEEN ANNE in her robe; in her hair
3283	richly adorned with pearl, crowned. On each
3284	side her, the Bishops of London and
3285	Winchester.
3286	
3287	9. The old Duchess of Norfolk, in a coronal of
3288	gold, wrought with flowers, bearing QUEEN
3289	ANNE's train.
3290	
3291	10. Certain Ladies or Countesses, with plain
3292	circlets of gold without flowers.
3293	
3294	[They pass over the stage in order and state]
3295	
3296	Second Gentleman	A royal train, believe me. These I know:
3297	Who's that that bears the sceptre?
3298	
3299	First Gentleman	Marquess Dorset:
3300	And that the Earl of Surrey, with the rod.
3301	
3302	Second Gentleman	A bold brave gentleman. That should be
3303	The Duke of Suffolk?
3304	
3305	First Gentleman	'Tis the same: high-steward.
3306	
3307	Second Gentleman	And that my Lord of Norfolk?
3308	
3309	First Gentleman	Yes;
3310	
3311	Second Gentleman	Heaven bless thee!
3312	
3313	[Looking on QUEEN ANNE]
3314	
3315	Thou hast the sweetest face I ever look'd on.
3316	Sir, as I have a soul, she is an angel;
3317	Our king has all the Indies in his arms,
3318	And more and richer, when he strains that lady:
3319	I cannot blame his conscience.
3320	
3321	First Gentleman	They that bear
3322	The cloth of honour over her, are four barons
3323	Of the Cinque-ports.
3324	
3325	Second Gentleman	Those men are happy; and so are all are near her.
3326	I take it, she that carries up the train
3327	Is that old noble lady, Duchess of Norfolk.
3328	
3329	First Gentleman	It is; and all the rest are countesses.
3330	
3331	Second Gentleman	Their coronets say so. These are stars indeed;
3332	And sometimes falling ones.
3333	
3334	First Gentleman	No more of that.
3335	
3336	[Exit procession, and then a great flourish of trumpets]
3337	
3338	[Enter a third Gentleman]
3339	
3340	First Gentleman	God save you, sir! where have you been broiling?
3341	
3342	Third Gentleman	Among the crowd i' the Abbey; where a finger
3343	Could not be wedged in more: I am stifled
3344	With the mere rankness of their joy.
3345	
3346	Second Gentleman	You saw
3347	The ceremony?
3348	
3349	Third Gentleman	                  That I did.
3350	
3351	First Gentleman	How was it?
3352	
3353	Third Gentleman	Well worth the seeing.
3354	
3355	Second Gentleman	Good sir, speak it to us.
3356	
3357	Third Gentleman	As well as I am able. The rich stream
3358	Of lords and ladies, having brought the queen
3359	To a prepared place in the choir, fell off
3360	A distance from her; while her grace sat down
3361	To rest awhile, some half an hour or so,
3362	In a rich chair of state, opposing freely
3363	The beauty of her person to the people.
3364	Believe me, sir, she is the goodliest woman
3365	That ever lay by man: which when the people
3366	Had the full view of, such a noise arose
3367	As the shrouds make at sea in a stiff tempest,
3368	As loud, and to as many tunes: hats, cloaks--
3369	Doublets, I think,--flew up; and had their faces
3370	Been loose, this day they had been lost. Such joy
3371	I never saw before. Great-bellied women,
3372	That had not half a week to go, like rams
3373	In the old time of war, would shake the press,
3374	And make 'em reel before 'em. No man living
3375	Could say 'This is my wife' there; all were woven
3376	So strangely in one piece.
3377	
3378	Second Gentleman	But, what follow'd?
3379	
3380	Third Gentleman	At length her grace rose, and with modest paces
3381	Came to the altar; where she kneel'd, and saint-like
3382	Cast her fair eyes to heaven and pray'd devoutly.
3383	Then rose again and bow'd her to the people:
3384	When by the Archbishop of Canterbury
3385	She had all the royal makings of a queen;
3386	As holy oil, Edward Confessor's crown,
3387	The rod, and bird of peace, and all such emblems
3388	Laid nobly on her: which perform'd, the choir,
3389	With all the choicest music of the kingdom,
3390	Together sung 'Te Deum.' So she parted,
3391	And with the same full state paced back again
3392	To York-place, where the feast is held.
3393	
3394	First Gentleman	Sir,
3395	You must no more call it York-place, that's past;
3396	For, since the cardinal fell, that title's lost:
3397	'Tis now the king's, and call'd Whitehall.
3398	
3399	Third Gentleman	I know it;
3400	But 'tis so lately alter'd, that the old name
3401	Is fresh about me.
3402	
3403	Second Gentleman	                  What two reverend bishops
3404	Were those that went on each side of the queen?
3405	
3406	Third Gentleman	Stokesly and Gardiner; the one of Winchester,
3407	Newly preferr'd from the king's secretary,
3408	The other, London.
3409	
3410	Second Gentleman	                  He of Winchester
3411	Is held no great good lover of the archbishop's,
3412	The virtuous Cranmer.
3413	
3414	Third Gentleman	All the land knows that:
3415	However, yet there is no great breach; when it comes,
3416	Cranmer will find a friend will not shrink from him.
3417	
3418	Second Gentleman	Who may that be, I pray you?
3419	
3420	Third Gentleman	Thomas Cromwell;
3421	A man in much esteem with the king, and truly
3422	A worthy friend. The king has made him master
3423	O' the jewel house,
3424	And one, already, of the privy council.
3425	
3426	Second Gentleman	He will deserve more.
3427	
3428	Third Gentleman	Yes, without all doubt.
3429	Come, gentlemen, ye shall go my way, which
3430	Is to the court, and there ye shall be my guests:
3431	Something I can command. As I walk thither,
3432	I'll tell ye more.
3433	
3434	Both	                  You may command us, sir.
3435	
3436	[Exeunt]

3440	
3441	KING HENRY VIII
3442	
3443	
3444	ACT IV
3445	
3446	
3447	
3448	SCENE II	Kimbolton.
3449	
3450	
3451	[Enter KATHARINE, Dowager, sick; led between
3452	GRIFFITH, her gentleman usher, and PATIENCE, her woman]
3453	
3454	GRIFFITH	How does your grace?
3455	
3456	KATHARINE	O Griffith, sick to death!
3457	My legs, like loaden branches, bow to the earth,
3458	Willing to leave their burthen. Reach a chair:
3459	So; now, methinks, I feel a little ease.
3460	Didst thou not tell me, Griffith, as thou led'st me,
3461	That the great child of honour, Cardinal Wolsey, Was dead?
3462	
3463	GRIFFITH	        Yes, madam; but I think your grace,
3464	Out of the pain you suffer'd, gave no ear to't.
3465	
3466	KATHARINE	Prithee, good Griffith, tell me how he died:
3467	If well, he stepp'd before me, happily
3468	For my example.
3469	
3470	GRIFFITH	                  Well, the voice goes, madam:
3471	For after the stout Earl Northumberland
3472	Arrested him at York, and brought him forward,
3473	As a man sorely tainted, to his answer,
3474	He fell sick suddenly, and grew so ill
3475	He could not sit his mule.
3476	
3477	KATHARINE	Alas, poor man!
3478	
3479	GRIFFITH	At last, with easy roads, he came to Leicester,
3480	Lodged in the abbey; where the reverend abbot,
3481	With all his covent, honourably received him;
3482	To whom he gave these words, 'O, father abbot,
3483	An old man, broken with the storms of state,
3484	Is come to lay his weary bones among ye;
3485	Give him a little earth for charity!'
3486	So went to bed; where eagerly his sickness
3487	Pursued him still: and, three nights after this,
3488	About the hour of eight, which he himself
3489	Foretold should be his last, full of repentance,
3490	Continual meditations, tears, and sorrows,
3491	He gave his honours to the world again,
3492	His blessed part to heaven, and slept in peace.
3493	
3494	KATHARINE	So may he rest; his faults lie gently on him!
3495	Yet thus far, Griffith, give me leave to speak him,
3496	And yet with charity. He was a man
3497	Of an unbounded stomach, ever ranking
3498	Himself with princes; one that, by suggestion,
3499	Tied all the kingdom: simony was fair-play;
3500	His own opinion was his law: i' the presence
3501	He would say untruths; and be ever double
3502	Both in his words and meaning: he was never,
3503	But where he meant to ruin, pitiful:
3504	His promises were, as he then was, mighty;
3505	But his performance, as he is now, nothing:
3506	Of his own body he was ill, and gave
3507	The clergy in example.
3508	
3509	GRIFFITH	Noble madam,
3510	Men's evil manners live in brass; their virtues
3511	We write in water. May it please your highness
3512	To hear me speak his good now?
3513	
3514	KATHARINE	Yes, good Griffith;
3515	I were malicious else.
3516	
3517	GRIFFITH	This cardinal,
3518	Though from an humble stock, undoubtedly
3519	Was fashion'd to much honour from his cradle.
3520	He was a scholar, and a ripe and good one;
3521	Exceeding wise, fair-spoken, and persuading:
3522	Lofty and sour to them that loved him not;
3523	But to those men that sought him sweet as summer.
3524	And though he were unsatisfied in getting,
3525	Which was a sin, yet in bestowing, madam,
3526	He was most princely: ever witness for him
3527	Those twins Of learning that he raised in you,
3528	Ipswich and Oxford! one of which fell with him,
3529	Unwilling to outlive the good that did it;
3530	The other, though unfinish'd, yet so famous,
3531	So excellent in art, and still so rising,
3532	That Christendom shall ever speak his virtue.
3533	His overthrow heap'd happiness upon him;
3534	For then, and not till then, he felt himself,
3535	And found the blessedness of being little:
3536	And, to add greater honours to his age
3537	Than man could give him, he died fearing God.
3538	
3539	KATHARINE	After my death I wish no other herald,
3540	No other speaker of my living actions,
3541	To keep mine honour from corruption,
3542	But such an honest chronicler as Griffith.
3543	Whom I most hated living, thou hast made me,
3544	With thy religious truth and modesty,
3545	Now in his ashes honour: peace be with him!
3546	Patience, be near me still; and set me lower:
3547	I have not long to trouble thee. Good Griffith,
3548	Cause the musicians play me that sad note
3549	I named my knell, whilst I sit meditating
3550	On that celestial harmony I go to.
3551	
3552	[Sad and solemn music]
3553	
3554	GRIFFITH	She is asleep: good wench, let's sit down quiet,
3555	For fear we wake her: softly, gentle Patience.
3556	
3557	[The vision. Enter, solemnly tripping one after
3558	another, six personages, clad in white robes,
3559	wearing on their heads garlands of bays, and golden
3560	vizards on their faces; branches of bays or palm in
3561	their hands. They first congee unto her, then
3562	dance; and, at certain changes, the first two hold
3563	a spare garland over her head; at which the other
3564	four make reverent curtsies; then the two that held
3565	the garland deliver the same to the other next two,
3566	who observe the same order in their changes, and
3567	holding the garland over her head: which done,
3568	they deliver the same garland to the last two, who
3569	likewise observe the same order: at which, as it
3570	were by inspiration, she makes in her sleep signs
3571	of rejoicing, and holdeth up her hands to heaven:
3572	and so in their dancing vanish, carrying the
3573	garland with them. The music continues]
3574	
3575	KATHARINE	Spirits of peace, where are ye? are ye all gone,
3576	And leave me here in wretchedness behind ye?
3577	
3578	GRIFFITH	Madam, we are here.
3579	
3580	KATHARINE	It is not you I call for:
3581	Saw ye none enter since I slept?
3582	
3583	GRIFFITH	None, madam.
3584	
3585	KATHARINE	No? Saw you not, even now, a blessed troop
3586	Invite me to a banquet; whose bright faces
3587	Cast thousand beams upon me, like the sun?
3588	They promised me eternal happiness;
3589	And brought me garlands, Griffith, which I feel
3590	I am not worthy yet to wear: I shall, assuredly.
3591	
3592	GRIFFITH	I am most joyful, madam, such good dreams
3593	Possess your fancy.
3594	
3595	KATHARINE	Bid the music leave,
3596	They are harsh and heavy to me.
3597	
3598	[Music ceases]
3599	
3600	PATIENCE	Do you note
3601	How much her grace is alter'd on the sudden?
3602	How long her face is drawn? how pale she looks,
3603	And of an earthy cold? Mark her eyes!
3604	
3605	GRIFFITH	She is going, wench: pray, pray.
3606	
3607	PATIENCE	Heaven comfort her!
3608	
3609	[Enter a Messenger]
3610	
3611	Messenger	An't like your grace,--
3612	
3613	KATHARINE	You are a saucy fellow:
3614	Deserve we no more reverence?
3615	
3616	GRIFFITH	You are to blame,
3617	Knowing she will not lose her wonted greatness,
3618	To use so rude behavior; go to, kneel.
3619	
3620	Messenger	I humbly do entreat your highness' pardon;
3621	My haste made me unmannerly. There is staying
3622	A gentleman, sent from the king, to see you.
3623	
3624	KATHARINE	Admit him entrance, Griffith: but this fellow
3625	Let me ne'er see again.
3626	
3627	[Exeunt GRIFFITH and Messenger]
3628	
3629	[Re-enter GRIFFITH, with CAPUCIUS]
3630	
3631	If my sight fail not,
3632	You should be lord ambassador from the emperor,
3633	My royal nephew, and your name Capucius.
3634	
3635	CAPUCIUS	Madam, the same; your servant.
3636	
3637	KATHARINE	O, my lord,
3638	The times and titles now are alter'd strangely
3639	With me since first you knew me. But, I pray you,
3640	What is your pleasure with me?
3641	
3642	CAPUCIUS	Noble lady,
3643	First mine own service to your grace; the next,
3644	The king's request that I would visit you;
3645	Who grieves much for your weakness, and by me
3646	Sends you his princely commendations,
3647	And heartily entreats you take good comfort.
3648	
3649	KATHARINE	O my good lord, that comfort comes too late;
3650	'Tis like a pardon after execution:
3651	That gentle physic, given in time, had cured me;
3652	But now I am past an comforts here, but prayers.
3653	How does his highness?
3654	
3655	CAPUCIUS	Madam, in good health.
3656	
3657	KATHARINE	So may he ever do! and ever flourish,
3658	When I shall dwell with worms, and my poor name
3659	Banish'd the kingdom! Patience, is that letter,
3660	I caused you write, yet sent away?
3661	
3662	PATIENCE	No, madam.
3663	
3664	[Giving it to KATHARINE]
3665	
3666	KATHARINE	Sir, I most humbly pray you to deliver
3667	This to my lord the king.
3668	
3669	CAPUCIUS	Most willing, madam.
3670	
3671	KATHARINE	In which I have commended to his goodness
3672	The model of our chaste loves, his young daughter;
3673	The dews of heaven fall thick in blessings on her!
3674	Beseeching him to give her virtuous breeding--
3675	She is young, and of a noble modest nature,
3676	I hope she will deserve well,--and a little
3677	To love her for her mother's sake, that loved him,
3678	Heaven knows how dearly. My next poor petition
3679	Is, that his noble grace would have some pity
3680	Upon my wretched women, that so long
3681	Have follow'd both my fortunes faithfully:
3682	Of which there is not one, I dare avow,
3683	And now I should not lie, but will deserve
3684	For virtue and true beauty of the soul,
3685	For honesty and decent carriage,
3686	A right good husband, let him be a noble
3687	And, sure, those men are happy that shall have 'em.
3688	The last is, for my men; they are the poorest,
3689	But poverty could never draw 'em from me;
3690	That they may have their wages duly paid 'em,
3691	And something over to remember me by:
3692	If heaven had pleased to have given me longer life
3693	And able means, we had not parted thus.
3694	These are the whole contents: and, good my lord,
3695	By that you love the dearest in this world,
3696	As you wish Christian peace to souls departed,
3697	Stand these poor people's friend, and urge the king
3698	To do me this last right.
3699	
3700	CAPUCIUS	By heaven, I will,
3701	Or let me lose the fashion of a man!
3702	
3703	KATHARINE	I thank you, honest lord. Remember me
3704	In all humility unto his highness:
3705	Say his long trouble now is passing
3706	Out of this world; tell him, in death I bless'd him,
3707	For so I will. Mine eyes grow dim. Farewell,
3708	My lord. Griffith, farewell. Nay, Patience,
3709	You must not leave me yet: I must to bed;
3710	Call in more women. When I am dead, good wench,
3711	Let me be used with honour: strew me over
3712	With maiden flowers, that all the world may know
3713	I was a chaste wife to my grave: embalm me,
3714	Then lay me forth: although unqueen'd, yet like
3715	A queen, and daughter to a king, inter me.
3716	I can no more.

3729	
3730	SCENE I	London. A gallery in the palace.
3731	
3732	
3733	[Enter GARDINER, Bishop of Winchester, a Page with a
3734	torch before him, met by LOVELL]
3735	
3736	GARDINER	It's one o'clock, boy, is't not?
3737	
3738	Boy	It hath struck.
3739	
3740	GARDINER	These should be hours for necessities,
3741	Not for delights; times to repair our nature
3742	With comforting repose, and not for us
3743	To waste these times. Good hour of night, Sir Thomas!
3744	Whither so late?
3745	
3746	LOVELL	                  Came you from the king, my lord
3747	
3748	GARDINER	I did, Sir Thomas: and left him at primero
3749	With the Duke of Suffolk.
3750	
3751	LOVELL	I must to him too,
3752	Before he go to bed. I'll take my leave.
3753	
3754	GARDINER	Not yet, Sir Thomas Lovell. What's the matter?
3755	It seems you are in haste: an if there be
3756	No great offence belongs to't, give your friend
3757	Some touch of your late business: affairs, that walk,
3758	As they say spirits do, at midnight, have
3759	In them a wilder nature than the business
3760	That seeks dispatch by day.
3761	
3762	LOVELL	My lord, I love you;
3763	And durst commend a secret to your ear
3764	Much weightier than this work. The queen's in labour,
3765	They say, in great extremity; and fear'd
3766	She'll with the labour end.
3767	
3768	GARDINER	The fruit she goes with
3769	I pray for heartily, that it may find
3770	Good time, and live: but for the stock, Sir Thomas,
3771	I wish it grubb'd up now.
3772	
3773	LOVELL	Methinks I could
3774	Cry the amen; and yet my conscience says
3775	She's a good creature, and, sweet lady, does
3776	Deserve our better wishes.
3777	
3778	GARDINER	But, sir, sir,
3779	Hear me, Sir Thomas: you're a gentleman
3780	Of mine own way; I know you wise, religious;
3781	And, let me tell you, it will ne'er be well,
3782	'Twill not, Sir Thomas Lovell, take't of me,
3783	Till Cranmer, Cromwell, her two hands, and she,
3784	Sleep in their graves.
3785	
3786	LOVELL	Now, sir, you speak of two
3787	The most remark'd i' the kingdom. As for Cromwell,
3788	Beside that of the jewel house, is made master
3789	O' the rolls, and the king's secretary; further, sir,
3790	Stands in the gap and trade of moe preferments,
3791	With which the time will load him. The archbishop
3792	Is the king's hand and tongue; and who dare speak
3793	One syllable against him?
3794	
3795	GARDINER	Yes, yes, Sir Thomas,
3796	There are that dare; and I myself have ventured
3797	To speak my mind of him: and indeed this day,
3798	Sir, I may tell it you, I think I have
3799	Incensed the lords o' the council, that he is,
3800	For so I know he is, they know he is,
3801	A most arch heretic, a pestilence
3802	That does infect the land: with which they moved
3803	Have broken with the king; who hath so far
3804	Given ear to our complaint, of his great grace
3805	And princely care foreseeing those fell mischiefs
3806	Our reasons laid before him, hath commanded
3807	To-morrow morning to the council-board
3808	He be convented. He's a rank weed, Sir Thomas,
3809	And we must root him out. From your affairs
3810	I hinder you too long: good night, Sir Thomas.
3811	
3812	LOVELL	Many good nights, my lord: I rest your servant.
3813	
3814	[Exeunt GARDINER and Page]
3815	
3816	[Enter KING HENRY VIII and SUFFOLK]
3817	
3818	KING HENRY VIII	Charles, I will play no more tonight;
3819	My mind's not on't; you are too hard for me.
3820	
3821	SUFFOLK	Sir, I did never win of you before.
3822	
3823	KING HENRY VIII	But little, Charles;
3824	Nor shall not, when my fancy's on my play.
3825	Now, Lovell, from the queen what is the news?
3826	
3827	LOVELL	I could not personally deliver to her
3828	What you commanded me, but by her woman
3829	I sent your message; who return'd her thanks
3830	In the great'st humbleness, and desired your highness
3831	Most heartily to pray for her.
3832	
3833	KING HENRY VIII	What say'st thou, ha?
3834	To pray for her? what, is she crying out?
3835	
3836	LOVELL	So said her woman; and that her sufferance made
3837	Almost each pang a death.
3838	
3839	KING HENRY VIII	Alas, good lady!
3840	
3841	SUFFOLK	God safely quit her of her burthen, and
3842	With gentle travail, to the gladding of
3843	Your highness with an heir!
3844	
3845	KING HENRY VIII	'Tis midnight, Charles;
3846	Prithee, to bed; and in thy prayers remember
3847	The estate of my poor queen. Leave me alone;
3848	For I must think of that which company
3849	Would not be friendly to.
3850	
3851	SUFFOLK	I wish your highness
3852	A quiet night; and my good mistress will
3853	Remember in my prayers.
3854	
3855	KING HENRY VIII	Charles, good night.
3856	
3857	[Exit SUFFOLK]
3858	
3859	[Enter DENNY]
3860	
3861	Well, sir, what follows?
3862	
3863	DENNY	Sir, I have brought my lord the archbishop,
3864	As you commanded me.
3865	
3866	KING HENRY VIII	Ha! Canterbury?
3867	
3868	DENNY	Ay, my good lord.
3869	
3870	KING HENRY VIII	'Tis true: where is he, Denny?
3871	
3872	DENNY	He attends your highness' pleasure.
3873	
3874	[Exit DENNY]
3875	
3876	LOVELL	[Aside]  This is about that which the bishop spake:
3877	I am happily come hither.
3878	
3879	[Re-enter DENNY, with CRANMER]
3880	
3881	KING HENRY VIII	Avoid the gallery.
3882	
3883	[LOVELL seems to stay]
3884	
3885	Ha! I have said. Be gone. What!
3886	
3887	[Exeunt LOVELL and DENNY]
3888	
3889	CRANMER	[Aside]
3890	I am fearful: wherefore frowns he thus?
3891	'Tis his aspect of terror. All's not well.
3892	
3893	KING HENRY VIII	How now, my lord! you desire to know
3894	Wherefore I sent for you.
3895	
3896	CRANMER	[Kneeling]              It is my duty
3897	To attend your highness' pleasure.
3898	
3899	KING HENRY VIII	Pray you, arise,
3900	My good and gracious Lord of Canterbury.
3901	Come, you and I must walk a turn together;
3902	I have news to tell you: come, come, give me your hand.
3903	Ah, my good lord, I grieve at what I speak,
3904	And am right sorry to repeat what follows
3905	I have, and most unwillingly, of late
3906	Heard many grievous, I do say, my lord,
3907	Grievous complaints of you; which, being consider'd,
3908	Have moved us and our council, that you shall
3909	This morning come before us; where, I know,
3910	You cannot with such freedom purge yourself,
3911	But that, till further trial in those charges
3912	Which will require your answer, you must take
3913	Your patience to you, and be well contented
3914	To make your house our Tower: you a brother of us,
3915	It fits we thus proceed, or else no witness
3916	Would come against you.
3917	
3918	CRANMER	[Kneeling]
3919	
3920	I humbly thank your highness;
3921	And am right glad to catch this good occasion
3922	Most throughly to be winnow'd, where my chaff
3923	And corn shall fly asunder: for, I know,
3924	There's none stands under more calumnious tongues
3925	Than I myself, poor man.
3926	
3927	KING HENRY VIII	Stand up, good Canterbury:
3928	Thy truth and thy integrity is rooted
3929	In us, thy friend: give me thy hand, stand up:
3930	Prithee, let's walk. Now, by my holidame.
3931	What manner of man are you? My lord, I look'd
3932	You would have given me your petition, that
3933	I should have ta'en some pains to bring together
3934	Yourself and your accusers; and to have heard you,
3935	Without indurance, further.
3936	
3937	CRANMER	Most dread liege,
3938	The good I stand on is my truth and honesty:
3939	If they shall fail, I, with mine enemies,
3940	Will triumph o'er my person; which I weigh not,
3941	Being of those virtues vacant. I fear nothing
3942	What can be said against me.
3943	
3944	KING HENRY VIII	Know you not
3945	How your state stands i' the world, with the whole world?
3946	Your enemies are many, and not small; their practises
3947	Must bear the same proportion; and not ever
3948	The justice and the truth o' the question carries
3949	The due o' the verdict with it: at what ease
3950	Might corrupt minds procure knaves as corrupt
3951	To swear against you? such things have been done.
3952	You are potently opposed; and with a malice
3953	Of as great size. Ween you of better luck,
3954	I mean, in perjured witness, than your master,
3955	Whose minister you are, whiles here he lived
3956	Upon this naughty earth? Go to, go to;
3957	You take a precipice for no leap of danger,
3958	And woo your own destruction.
3959	
3960	CRANMER	God and your majesty
3961	Protect mine innocence, or I fall into
3962	The trap is laid for me!
3963	
3964	KING HENRY VIII	Be of good cheer;
3965	They shall no more prevail than we give way to.
3966	Keep comfort to you; and this morning see
3967	You do appear before them: if they shall chance,
3968	In charging you with matters, to commit you,
3969	The best persuasions to the contrary
3970	Fail not to use, and with what vehemency
3971	The occasion shall instruct you: if entreaties
3972	Will render you no remedy, this ring
3973	Deliver them, and your appeal to us
3974	There make before them. Look, the good man weeps!
3975	He's honest, on mine honour. God's blest mother!
3976	I swear he is true--hearted; and a soul
3977	None better in my kingdom. Get you gone,
3978	And do as I have bid you.
3979	
3980	[Exit CRANMER]
3981	
3982	He has strangled
3983	His language in his tears.
3984	
3985	[Enter Old Lady, LOVELL following]
3986	
3987	Gentleman	[Within]                 Come back: what mean you?
3988	
3989	Old Lady	I'll not come back; the tidings that I bring
3990	Will make my boldness manners. Now, good angels
3991	Fly o'er thy royal head, and shade thy person
3992	Under their blessed wings!
3993	
3994	KING HENRY VIII	Now, by thy looks
3995	I guess thy message. Is the queen deliver'd?
3996	Say, ay; and of a boy.
3997	
3998	Old Lady	Ay, ay, my liege;
3999	And of a lovely boy: the God of heaven
4000	Both now and ever bless her! 'tis a girl,
4001	Promises boys hereafter. Sir, your queen
4002	Desires your visitation, and to be
4003	Acquainted with this stranger 'tis as like you
4004	As cherry is to cherry.
4005	
4006	KING HENRY VIII	Lovell!
4007	
4008	LOVELL	Sir?
4009	
4010	KING HENRY VIII	Give her an hundred marks. I'll to the queen.
4011	
4012	[Exit]
4013	
4014	Old Lady	An hundred marks! By this light, I'll ha' more.
4015	An ordinary groom is for such payment.
4016	I will have more, or scold it out of him.
4017	Said I for this, the girl was like to him?
4018	I will have more, or else unsay't; and now,
4019	While it is hot, I'll put it to the issue.

4035	
4036	
4037	[Enter CRANMER]
4038	
4039	CRANMER	I hope I am not too late; and yet the gentleman,
4040	That was sent to me from the council, pray'd me
4041	To make great haste. All fast? what means this? Ho!
4042	Who waits there? Sure, you know me?
4043	
4044	[Enter Keeper]
4045	
4046	Keeper	Yes, my lord;
4047	But yet I cannot help you.
4048	
4049	CRANMER	Why?
4050	
4051	[Enter DOCTOR BUTTS]
4052	
4053	Keeper	Your grace must wait till you be call'd for.
4054	
4055	CRANMER	So.
4056	
4057	DOCTOR BUTTS	[Aside]  This is a piece of malice. I am glad
4058	I came this way so happily: the king
4059	Shall understand it presently.
4060	
4061	[Exit]
4062	
4063	CRANMER	[Aside]	'Tis Butts,
4064	The king's physician: as he pass'd along,
4065	How earnestly he cast his eyes upon me!
4066	Pray heaven, he sound not my disgrace! For certain,
4067	This is of purpose laid by some that hate me--
4068	God turn their hearts! I never sought their malice--
4069	To quench mine honour: they would shame to make me
4070	Wait else at door, a fellow-counsellor,
4071	'Mong boys, grooms, and lackeys. But their pleasures
4072	Must be fulfill'd, and I attend with patience.
4073	
4074	[Enter the KING HENRY VIII and DOCTOR BUTTS at a window above]
4075	
4076	DOCTOR BUTTS	I'll show your grace the strangest sight--
4077	
4078	KING HENRY VIII	What's that, Butts?
4079	
4080	DOCTOR BUTTS	I think your highness saw this many a day.
4081	
4082	KING HENRY VIII	Body o' me, where is it?
4083	
4084	DOCTOR BUTTS	There, my lord:
4085	The high promotion of his grace of Canterbury;
4086	Who holds his state at door, 'mongst pursuivants,
4087	Pages, and footboys.
4088	
4089	KING HENRY VIII	Ha! 'tis he, indeed:
4090	Is this the honour they do one another?
4091	'Tis well there's one above 'em yet. I had thought
4092	They had parted so much honesty among 'em
4093	At least, good manners, as not thus to suffer
4094	A man of his place, and so near our favour,
4095	To dance attendance on their lordships' pleasures,
4096	And at the door too, like a post with packets.
4097	By holy Mary, Butts, there's knavery:
4098	Let 'em alone, and draw the curtain close:
4099	We shall hear more anon.

4118	void above him, as for CRANMER's seat. SUFFOLK,
4119	NORFOLK, SURREY, Chamberlain, GARDINER, seat
4120	themselves in order on each side. CROMWELL at

4122	
4123	Chancellor	Speak to the business, master-secretary:
4124	Why are we met in council?
4125	
4126	CROMWELL	Please your honours,
4127	The chief cause concerns his grace of Canterbury.
4128	
4129	GARDINER	Has he had knowledge of it?
4130	
4131	CROMWELL	Yes.
4132	
4133	NORFOLK	Who waits there?
4134	
4135	Keeper	Without, my noble lords?
4136	
4137	GARDINER	Yes.
4138	
4139	Keeper	My lord archbishop;
4140	And has done half an hour, to know your pleasures.
4141	
4142	Chancellor	Let him come in.
4143	
4144	Keeper	                  Your grace may enter now.
4145	
4146	[CRANMER enters and approaches the council-table]
4147	
4148	Chancellor	My good lord archbishop, I'm very sorry
4149	To sit here at this present, and behold
4150	That chair stand empty: but we all are men,
4151	In our own natures frail, and capable
4152	Of our flesh; few are angels: out of which frailty
4153	And want of wisdom, you, that best should teach us,
4154	Have misdemean'd yourself, and not a little,
4155	Toward the king first, then his laws, in filling
4156	The whole realm, by your teaching and your chaplains,
4157	For so we are inform'd, with new opinions,
4158	Divers and dangerous; which are heresies,
4159	And, not reform'd, may prove pernicious.
4160	
4161	GARDINER	Which reformation must be sudden too,
4162	My noble lords; for those that tame wild horses
4163	Pace 'em not in their hands to make 'em gentle,
4164	But stop their mouths with stubborn bits, and spur 'em,
4165	Till they obey the manage. If we suffer,
4166	Out of our easiness and childish pity
4167	To one man's honour, this contagious sickness,
4168	Farewell all physic: and what follows then?
4169	Commotions, uproars, with a general taint
4170	Of the whole state: as, of late days, our neighbours,
4171	The upper Germany, can dearly witness,
4172	Yet freshly pitied in our memories.
4173	
4174	CRANMER	My good lords, hitherto, in all the progress
4175	Both of my life and office, I have labour'd,
4176	And with no little study, that my teaching
4177	And the strong course of my authority
4178	Might go one way, and safely; and the end
4179	Was ever, to do well: nor is there living,
4180	I speak it with a single heart, my lords,
4181	A man that more detests, more stirs against,
4182	Both in his private conscience and his place,
4183	Defacers of a public peace, than I do.
4184	Pray heaven, the king may never find a heart
4185	With less allegiance in it! Men that make
4186	Envy and crooked malice nourishment
4187	Dare bite the best. I do beseech your lordships,
4188	That, in this case of justice, my accusers,
4189	Be what they will, may stand forth face to face,
4190	And freely urge against me.
4191	
4192	SUFFOLK	Nay, my lord,
4193	That cannot be: you are a counsellor,
4194	And, by that virtue, no man dare accuse you.
4195	
4196	GARDINER	My lord, because we have business of more moment,
4197	We will be short with you. 'Tis his highness' pleasure,
4198	And our consent, for better trial of you,
4199	From hence you be committed to the Tower;
4200	Where, being but a private man again,
4201	You shall know many dare accuse you boldly,
4202	More than, I fear, you are provided for.
4203	
4204	CRANMER	Ah, my good Lord of Winchester, I thank you;
4205	You are always my good friend; if your will pass,
4206	I shall both find your lordship judge and juror,
4207	You are so merciful: I see your end;
4208	'Tis my undoing: love and meekness, lord,
4209	Become a churchman better than ambition:
4210	Win straying souls with modesty again,
4211	Cast none away. That I shall clear myself,
4212	Lay all the weight ye can upon my patience,
4213	I make as little doubt, as you do conscience
4214	In doing daily wrongs. I could say more,
4215	But reverence to your calling makes me modest.
4216	
4217	GARDINER	My lord, my lord, you are a sectary,
4218	That's the plain truth: your painted gloss discovers,
4219	To men that understand you, words and weakness.
4220	
4221	CROMWELL	My Lord of Winchester, you are a little,
4222	By your good favour, too sharp; men so noble,
4223	However faulty, yet should find respect
4224	For what they have been: 'tis a cruelty
4225	To load a falling man.
4226	
4227	GARDINER	Good master secretary,
4228	I cry your honour mercy; you may, worst
4229	Of all this table, say so.
4230	
4231	CROMWELL	Why, my lord?
4232	
4233	GARDINER	Do not I know you for a favourer
4234	Of this new sect? ye are not sound.
4235	
4236	CROMWELL	Not sound?
4237	
4238	GARDINER	Not sound, I say.
4239	
4240	CROMWELL	                  Would you were half so honest!
4241	Men's prayers then would seek you, not their fears.
4242	
4243	GARDINER	I shall remember this bold language.
4244	
4245	CROMWELL	Do.
4246	Remember your bold life too.
4247	
4248	Chancellor	This is too much;
4249	Forbear, for shame, my lords.
4250	
4251	GARDINER	I have done.
4252	
4253	CROMWELL	And I.
4254	
4255	Chancellor	Then thus for you, my lord: it stands agreed,
4256	I take it, by all voices, that forthwith
4257	You be convey'd to the Tower a prisoner;
4258	There to remain till the king's further pleasure
4259	Be known unto us: are you all agreed, lords?
4260	
4261	All	We are.
4262	
4263	CRANMER	      Is there no other way of mercy,
4264	But I must needs to the Tower, my lords?
4265	
4266	GARDINER	What other
4267	Would you expect? you are strangely troublesome.
4268	Let some o' the guard be ready there.
4269	
4270	[Enter Guard]
4271	
4272	CRANMER	For me?
4273	Must I go like a traitor thither?
4274	
4275	GARDINER	Receive him,
4276	And see him safe i' the Tower.
4277	
4278	CRANMER	Stay, good my lords,
4279	I have a little yet to say. Look there, my lords;
4280	By virtue of that ring, I take my cause
4281	Out of the gripes of cruel men, and give it
4282	To a most noble judge, the king my master.
4283	
4284	Chamberlain	This is the king's ring.
4285	
4286	SURREY	'Tis no counterfeit.
4287	
4288	SUFFOLK	'Tis the right ring, by heaven: I told ye all,
4289	When ye first put this dangerous stone a-rolling,
4290	'Twould fall upon ourselves.
4291	
4292	NORFOLK	Do you think, my lords,
4293	The king will suffer but the little finger
4294	Of this man to be vex'd?
4295	
4296	Chancellor	'Tis now too certain:
4297	How much more is his life in value with him?
4298	Would I were fairly out on't!
4299	
4300	CROMWELL	My mind gave me,
4301	In seeking tales and informations
4302	Against this man, whose honesty the devil
4303	And his disciples only envy at,
4304	Ye blew the fire that burns ye: now have at ye!
4305	
4306	[Enter KING, frowning on them; takes his seat]
4307	
4308	GARDINER	Dread sovereign, how much are we bound to heaven
4309	In daily thanks, that gave us such a prince;
4310	Not only good and wise, but most religious:
4311	One that, in all obedience, makes the church
4312	The chief aim of his honour; and, to strengthen
4313	That holy duty, out of dear respect,
4314	His royal self in judgment comes to hear
4315	The cause betwixt her and this great offender.
4316	
4317	KING HENRY VIII	You were ever good at sudden commendations,
4318	Bishop of Winchester. But know, I come not
4319	To hear such flattery now, and in my presence;
4320	They are too thin and bare to hide offences.
4321	To me you cannot reach, you play the spaniel,
4322	And think with wagging of your tongue to win me;
4323	But, whatsoe'er thou takest me for, I'm sure
4324	Thou hast a cruel nature and a bloody.
4325	
4326	[To CRANMER]
4327	
4328	Good man, sit down. Now let me see the proudest
4329	He, that dares most, but wag his finger at thee:
4330	By all that's holy, he had better starve
4331	Than but once think this place becomes thee not.
4332	
4333	SURREY	May it please your grace,--
4334	
4335	KING HENRY VIII	No, sir, it does not please me.
4336	I had thought I had had men of some understanding
4337	And wisdom of my council; but I find none.
4338	Was it discretion, lords, to let this man,
4339	This good man,--few of you deserve that title,--
4340	This honest man, wait like a lousy footboy
4341	At chamber--door? and one as great as you are?
4342	Why, what a shame was this! Did my commission
4343	Bid ye so far forget yourselves? I gave ye
4344	Power as he was a counsellor to try him,
4345	Not as a groom: there's some of ye, I see,
4346	More out of malice than integrity,
4347	Would try him to the utmost, had ye mean;
4348	Which ye shall never have while I live.
4349	
4350	Chancellor	Thus far,
4351	My most dread sovereign, may it like your grace
4352	To let my tongue excuse all. What was purposed
4353	Concerning his imprisonment, was rather,
4354	If there be faith in men, meant for his trial,
4355	And fair purgation to the world, than malice,
4356	I'm sure, in me.
4357	
4358	KING HENRY VIII	Well, well, my lords, respect him;
4359	Take him, and use him well, he's worthy of it.
4360	I will say thus much for him, if a prince
4361	May be beholding to a subject, I
4362	Am, for his love and service, so to him.
4363	Make me no more ado, but all embrace him:
4364	Be friends, for shame, my lords! My Lord of
4365	Canterbury,
4366	I have a suit which you must not deny me;
4367	That is, a fair young maid that yet wants baptism,
4368	You must be godfather, and answer for her.
4369	
4370	CRANMER	The greatest monarch now alive may glory
4371	In such an honour: how may I deserve it
4372	That am a poor and humble subject to you?
4373	
4374	KING HENRY VIII	Come, come, my lord, you'ld spare your spoons: you
4375	shall have two noble partners with you; the old
4376	Duchess of Norfolk, and Lady Marquess Dorset: will
4377	these please you?
4378	Once more, my Lord of Winchester, I charge you,
4379	Embrace and love this man.
4380	
4381	GARDINER	With a true heart
4382	And brother-love I do it.
4383	
4384	CRANMER	And let heaven
4385	Witness, how dear I hold this confirmation.
4386	
4387	KING HENRY VIII	Good man, those joyful tears show thy true heart:
4388	The common voice, I see, is verified
4389	Of thee, which says thus, 'Do my Lord of Canterbury
4390	A shrewd turn, and he is your friend for ever.'
4391	Come, lords, we trifle time away; I long
4392	To have this young one made a Christian.
4393	As I have made ye one, lords, one remain;
4394	So I grow stronger, you more honour gain.
4395

4404	ACT V
4405	
4406	
4407	
4408	SCENE IV	The palace yard.
4409	
4410	
4411	[Noise and tumult within. Enter Porter and his Man]
4412	
4413	Porter	You'll leave your noise anon, ye rascals: do you
4414	take the court for Paris-garden? ye rude slaves,
4415	leave your gaping.
4416	
4417	[Within]
4418	
4419	Good master porter, I belong to the larder.
4420	
4421	Porter	Belong to the gallows, and be hanged, ye rogue! is
4422	this a place to roar in? Fetch me a dozen crab-tree
4423	staves, and strong ones: these are but switches to
4424	'em. I'll scratch your heads: you must be seeing
4425	christenings? do you look for ale and cakes here,
4426	you rude rascals?
4427	
4428	Man	Pray, sir, be patient: 'tis as much impossible--
4429	Unless we sweep 'em from the door with cannons--
4430	To scatter 'em, as 'tis to make 'em sleep
4431	On May-day morning; which will never be:
4432	We may as well push against Powle's, as stir em.
4433	
4434	Porter	How got they in, and be hang'd?
4435	
4436	Man	Alas, I know not; how gets the tide in?
4437	As much as one sound cudgel of four foot--
4438	You see the poor remainder--could distribute,
4439	I made no spare, sir.
4440	
4441	Porter	You did nothing, sir.
4442	
4443	Man	I am not Samson, nor Sir Guy, nor Colbrand,
4444	To mow 'em down before me: but if I spared any
4445	That had a head to hit, either young or old,
4446	He or she, cuckold or cuckold-maker,
4447	Let me ne'er hope to see a chine again
4448	And that I would not for a cow, God save her!
4449	
4450	[Within]
4451	
4452	Do you hear, master porter?
4453	
4454	Porter	I shall be with you presently, good master puppy.
4455	Keep the door close, sirrah.
4456	
4457	Man	What would you have me do?
4458	
4459	Porter	What should you do, but knock 'em down by the
4460	dozens? Is this Moorfields to muster in? or have
4461	we some strange Indian with the great tool come to
4462	court, the women so besiege us? Bless me, what a
4463	fry of fornication is at door! On my Christian
4464	conscience, this one christening will beget a
4465	thousand; here will be father, godfather, and all together.
4466	
4467	Man	The spoons will be the bigger, sir. There is a
4468	fellow somewhat near the door, he should be a
4469	brazier by his face, for, o' my conscience, twenty
4470	of the dog-days now reign in's nose; all that stand
4471	about him are under the line, they need no other
4472	penance: that fire-drake did I hit three times on
4473	the head, and three times was his nose discharged
4474	against me; he stands there, like a mortar-piece, to
4475	blow us. There was a haberdasher's wife of small
4476	wit near him, that railed upon me till her pinked
4477	porringer fell off her head, for kindling such a
4478	combustion in the state. I missed the meteor once,
4479	and hit that woman; who cried out 'Clubs!' when I
4480	might see from far some forty truncheoners draw to
4481	her succor, which were the hope o' the Strand, where
4482	she was quartered. They fell on; I made good my
4483	place: at length they came to the broom-staff to
4484	me; I defied 'em still: when suddenly a file of
4485	boys behind 'em, loose shot, delivered such a shower
4486	of pebbles, that I was fain to draw mine honour in,
4487	and let 'em win the work: the devil was amongst
4488	'em, I think, surely.
4489	
4490	Porter	These are the youths that thunder at a playhouse,
4491	and fight for bitten apples; that no audience, but
4492	the tribulation of Tower-hill, or the limbs of
4493	Limehouse, their dear brothers, are able to endure.
4494	I have some of 'em in Limbo Patrum, and there they
4495	are like to dance these three days; besides the
4496	running banquet of two beadles that is to come.
4497	
4498	[Enter Chamberlain]
4499	
4500	Chamberlain	Mercy o' me, what a multitude are here!
4501	They grow still too; from all parts they are coming,
4502	As if we kept a fair here! Where are these porters,
4503	These lazy knaves? Ye have made a fine hand, fellows:
4504	There's a trim rabble let in: are all these
4505	Your faithful friends o' the suburbs? We shall have
4506	Great store of room, no doubt, left for the ladies,
4507	When they pass back from the christening.
4508	
4509	Porter	An't please
4510	your honour,
4511	We are but men; and what so many may do,
4512	Not being torn a-pieces, we have done:
4513	An army cannot rule 'em.
4514	
4515	Chamberlain	As I live,
4516	If the king blame me for't, I'll lay ye all
4517	By the heels, and suddenly; and on your heads
4518	Clap round fines for neglect: ye are lazy knaves;
4519	And here ye lie baiting of bombards, when
4520	Ye should do service. Hark! the trumpets sound;
4521	They're come already from the christening:
4522	Go, break among the press, and find a way out
4523	To let the troop pass fairly; or I'll find
4524	A Marshalsea shall hold ye play these two months.
4525	
4526	Porter	Make way there for the princess.
4527	
4528	Man	You great fellow,
4529	Stand close up, or I'll make your head ache.
4530	
4531	Porter	You i' the camlet, get up o' the rail;
4532	I'll peck you o'er the pales else.

4544	
4545	
4546	SCENE V	The palace.
4547	
4548	
4549	[Enter trumpets, sounding; then two Aldermen, Lord
4550	Mayor, Garter, CRANMER, NORFOLK with his marshal's
4551	staff, SUFFOLK, two Noblemen bearing great
4552	standing-bowls for the christening-gifts; then
4553	four Noblemen bearing a canopy, under which the
4554	Duchess of Norfolk, godmother, bearing the child
4555	richly habited in a mantle, &c., train borne by a
4556	Lady; then follows the Marchioness Dorset, the
4557	other godmother, and Ladies. The troop pass once
4558	about the stage, and Garter speaks]
4559	
4560	Garter	Heaven, from thy endless goodness, send prosperous
4561	life, long, and ever happy, to the high and mighty
4562	princess of England, Elizabeth!
4563	
4564	[Flourish. Enter KING HENRY VIII and Guard]
4565	
4566	CRANMER	[Kneeling] And to your royal grace, and the good queen,
4567	My noble partners, and myself, thus pray:
4568	All comfort, joy, in this most gracious lady,
4569	Heaven ever laid up to make parents happy,
4570	May hourly fall upon ye!
4571	
4572	KING HENRY VIII	Thank you, good lord archbishop:
4573	What is her name?
4574	
4575	CRANMER	                  Elizabeth.
4576	
4577	KING HENRY VIII	Stand up, lord.
4578	
4579	[KING HENRY VIII kisses the child]
4580	
4581	With this kiss take my blessing: God protect thee!
4582	Into whose hand I give thy life.
4583	
4584	CRANMER	Amen.
4585	
4586	KING HENRY VIII	My noble gossips, ye have been too prodigal:
4587	I thank ye heartily; so shall this lady,
4588	When she has so much English.
4589	
4590	CRANMER	Let me speak, sir,
4591	For heaven now bids me; and the words I utter
4592	Let none think flattery, for they'll find 'em truth.
4593	This royal infant--heaven still move about her!--
4594	Though in her cradle, yet now promises
4595	Upon this land a thousand thousand blessings,
4596	Which time shall bring to ripeness: she shall be--
4597	But few now living can behold that goodness--
4598	A pattern to all princes living with her,
4599	And all that shall succeed: Saba was never
4600	More covetous of wisdom and fair virtue
4601	Than this pure soul shall be: all princely graces,
4602	That mould up such a mighty piece as this is,
4603	With all the virtues that attend the good,
4604	Shall still be doubled on her: truth shall nurse her,
4605	Holy and heavenly thoughts still counsel her:
4606	She shall be loved and fear'd: her own shall bless her;
4607	Her foes shake like a field of beaten corn,
4608	And hang their heads with sorrow: good grows with her:
4609	In her days every man shall eat in safety,
4610	Under his own vine, what he plants; and sing
4611	The merry songs of peace to all his neighbours:
4612	God shall be truly known; and those about her
4613	From her shall read the perfect ways of honour,
4614	And by those claim their greatness, not by blood.
4615	Nor shall this peace sleep with her: but as when
4616	The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
4617	Her ashes new create another heir,
4618	As great in admiration as herself;
4619	So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
4620	When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
4621	Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
4622	Shall star-like rise, as great in fame as she was,
4623	And so stand fix'd: peace, plenty, love, truth, terror,
4624	That were the servants to this chosen infant,
4625	Shall then be his, and like a vine grow to him:
4626	Wherever the bright sun of heaven shall shine,
4627	His honour and the greatness of his name
4628	Shall be, and make new nations: he shall flourish,
4629	And, like a mountain cedar, reach his branches
4630	To all the plains about him: our children's children
4631	Shall see this, and bless heaven.
4632	
4633	KING HENRY VIII	Thou speakest wonders.
4634	
4635	CRANMER	She shall be, to the happiness of England,
4636	An aged princess; many days shall see her,
4637	And yet no day without a deed to crown it.
4638	Would I had known no more! but she must die,
4639	She must, the saints must have her; yet a virgin,
4640	A most unspotted lily shall she pass
4641	To the ground, and all the world shall mourn her.
4642	
4643	KING HENRY VIII	O lord archbishop,
4644	Thou hast made me now a man! never, before
4645	This happy child, did I get any thing:
4646	This oracle of comfort has so pleased me,
4647	That when I am in heaven I shall desire
4648	To see what this child does, and praise my Maker.
4649	I thank ye all. To you, my good lord mayor,
4650	And your good brethren, I am much beholding;
4651	I have received much honour by your presence,
4652	And ye shall find me thankful. Lead the way, lords:
4653	Ye must all see the queen, and she must thank ye,
4654	She will be sick else. This day, no man think
4655	Has business at his house; for all shall stay:
4656	This little one shall make it holiday.

4664	
4665	EPILOGUE
4666	
4667	
4668	'Tis ten to one this play can never please
4669	All that are here: some come to take their ease,
4670	And sleep an act or two; but those, we fear,
4671	We have frighted with our trumpets; so, 'tis clear,
4672	They'll say 'tis naught: others, to hear the city
4673	Abused extremely, and to cry 'That's witty!'
4674	Which we have not done neither: that, I fear,
4675	All the expected good we're like to hear
4676	For this play at this time, is only in
4677	The merciful construction of good women;
4678	For such a one we show'd 'em: if they smile,
4679	And say 'twill do, I know, within a while
4680	All the best men are ours; for 'tis ill hap,
4681	If they hold when their ladies bid 'em clap.

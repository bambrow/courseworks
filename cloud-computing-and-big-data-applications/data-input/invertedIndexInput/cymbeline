84	
85	ACT I
86	
87	
88	
89	SCENE I	Britain. The garden of Cymbeline's palace.
90	
91	
92	[Enter two Gentlemen]
93	
94	First Gentleman	You do not meet a man but frowns: our bloods
95	No more obey the heavens than our courtiers
96	Still seem as does the king.
97	
98	Second Gentleman	But what's the matter?
99	
100	First Gentleman	His daughter, and the heir of's kingdom, whom
101	He purposed to his wife's sole son--a widow
102	That late he married--hath referr'd herself
103	Unto a poor but worthy gentleman: she's wedded;
104	Her husband banish'd; she imprison'd: all
105	Is outward sorrow; though I think the king
106	Be touch'd at very heart.
107	
108	Second Gentleman	None but the king?
109	
110	First Gentleman	He that hath lost her too; so is the queen,
111	That most desired the match; but not a courtier,
112	Although they wear their faces to the bent
113	Of the king's look's, hath a heart that is not
114	Glad at the thing they scowl at.
115	
116	Second Gentleman	And why so?
117	
118	First Gentleman	He that hath miss'd the princess is a thing
119	Too bad for bad report: and he that hath her--
120	I mean, that married her, alack, good man!
121	And therefore banish'd--is a creature such
122	As, to seek through the regions of the earth
123	For one his like, there would be something failing
124	In him that should compare. I do not think
125	So fair an outward and such stuff within
126	Endows a man but he.
127	
128	Second Gentleman	You speak him far.
129	
130	First Gentleman	I do extend him, sir, within himself,
131	Crush him together rather than unfold
132	His measure duly.
133	
134	Second Gentleman	                  What's his name and birth?
135	
136	First Gentleman	I cannot delve him to the root: his father
137	Was call'd Sicilius, who did join his honour
138	Against the Romans with Cassibelan,
139	But had his titles by Tenantius whom
140	He served with glory and admired success,
141	So gain'd the sur-addition Leonatus;
142	And had, besides this gentleman in question,
143	Two other sons, who in the wars o' the time
144	Died with their swords in hand; for which
145	their father,
146	Then old and fond of issue, took such sorrow
147	That he quit being, and his gentle lady,
148	Big of this gentleman our theme, deceased
149	As he was born. The king he takes the babe
150	To his protection, calls him Posthumus Leonatus,
151	Breeds him and makes him of his bed-chamber,
152	Puts to him all the learnings that his time
153	Could make him the receiver of; which he took,
154	As we do air, fast as 'twas minister'd,
155	And in's spring became a harvest, lived in court--
156	Which rare it is to do--most praised, most loved,
157	A sample to the youngest, to the more mature
158	A glass that feated them, and to the graver
159	A child that guided dotards; to his mistress,
160	For whom he now is banish'd, her own price
161	Proclaims how she esteem'd him and his virtue;
162	By her election may be truly read
163	What kind of man he is.
164	
165	Second Gentleman	I honour him
166	Even out of your report. But, pray you, tell me,
167	Is she sole child to the king?
168	
169	First Gentleman	His only child.
170	He had two sons: if this be worth your hearing,
171	Mark it: the eldest of them at three years old,
172	I' the swathing-clothes the other, from their nursery
173	Were stol'n, and to this hour no guess in knowledge
174	Which way they went.
175	
176	Second Gentleman	How long is this ago?
177	
178	First Gentleman	Some twenty years.
179	
180	Second Gentleman	That a king's children should be so convey'd,
181	So slackly guarded, and the search so slow,
182	That could not trace them!
183	
184	First Gentleman	Howsoe'er 'tis strange,
185	Or that the negligence may well be laugh'd at,
186	Yet is it true, sir.
187	
188	Second Gentleman	I do well believe you.
189	
190	First Gentleman	We must forbear: here comes the gentleman,
191	The queen, and princess.
192	
193	[Exeunt]
194	
195	[Enter the QUEEN, POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and IMOGEN]
196	
197	QUEEN	No, be assured you shall not find me, daughter,
198	After the slander of most stepmothers,
199	Evil-eyed unto you: you're my prisoner, but
200	Your gaoler shall deliver you the keys
201	That lock up your restraint. For you, Posthumus,
202	So soon as I can win the offended king,
203	I will be known your advocate: marry, yet
204	The fire of rage is in him, and 'twere good
205	You lean'd unto his sentence with what patience
206	Your wisdom may inform you.
207	
208	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Please your highness,
209	I will from hence to-day.
210	
211	QUEEN	You know the peril.
212	I'll fetch a turn about the garden, pitying
213	The pangs of barr'd affections, though the king
214	Hath charged you should not speak together.
215	
216	[Exit]
217	
218	IMOGEN	O
219	Dissembling courtesy! How fine this tyrant
220	Can tickle where she wounds! My dearest husband,
221	I something fear my father's wrath; but nothing--
222	Always reserved my holy duty--what
223	His rage can do on me: you must be gone;
224	And I shall here abide the hourly shot
225	Of angry eyes, not comforted to live,
226	But that there is this jewel in the world
227	That I may see again.
228	
229	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	My queen! my mistress!
230	O lady, weep no more, lest I give cause
231	To be suspected of more tenderness
232	Than doth become a man. I will remain
233	The loyal'st husband that did e'er plight troth:
234	My residence in Rome at one Philario's,
235	Who to my father was a friend, to me
236	Known but by letter: thither write, my queen,
237	And with mine eyes I'll drink the words you send,
238	Though ink be made of gall.
239	
240	[Re-enter QUEEN]
241	
242	QUEEN	Be brief, I pray you:
243	If the king come, I shall incur I know not
244	How much of his displeasure.
245	
246	[Aside]
247	
248	Yet I'll move him
249	To walk this way: I never do him wrong,
250	But he does buy my injuries, to be friends;
251	Pays dear for my offences.
252	
253	[Exit]
254	
255	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Should we be taking leave
256	As long a term as yet we have to live,
257	The loathness to depart would grow. Adieu!
258	
259	IMOGEN	Nay, stay a little:
260	Were you but riding forth to air yourself,
261	Such parting were too petty. Look here, love;
262	This diamond was my mother's: take it, heart;
263	But keep it till you woo another wife,
264	When Imogen is dead.
265	
266	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	How, how! another?
267	You gentle gods, give me but this I have,
268	And sear up my embracements from a next
269	With bonds of death!
270	
271	[Putting on the ring]
272	
273	Remain, remain thou here
274	While sense can keep it on. And, sweetest, fairest,
275	As I my poor self did exchange for you,
276	To your so infinite loss, so in our trifles
277	I still win of you: for my sake wear this;
278	It is a manacle of love; I'll place it
279	Upon this fairest prisoner.
280	
281	[Putting a bracelet upon her arm]
282	
283	IMOGEN	O the gods!
284	When shall we see again?
285	
286	[Enter CYMBELINE and Lords]
287	
288	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Alack, the king!
289	
290	CYMBELINE	Thou basest thing, avoid! hence, from my sight!
291	If after this command thou fraught the court
292	With thy unworthiness, thou diest: away!
293	Thou'rt poison to my blood.
294	
295	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The gods protect you!
296	And bless the good remainders of the court! I am gone.
297	
298	[Exit]
299	
300	IMOGEN	                  There cannot be a pinch in death
301	More sharp than this is.
302	
303	CYMBELINE	O disloyal thing,
304	That shouldst repair my youth, thou heap'st
305	A year's age on me.
306	
307	IMOGEN	I beseech you, sir,
308	Harm not yourself with your vexation
309	I am senseless of your wrath; a touch more rare
310	Subdues all pangs, all fears.
311	
312	CYMBELINE	Past grace? obedience?
313	
314	IMOGEN	Past hope, and in despair; that way, past grace.
315	
316	CYMBELINE	That mightst have had the sole son of my queen!
317	
318	IMOGEN	O blest, that I might not! I chose an eagle,
319	And did avoid a puttock.
320	
321	CYMBELINE	Thou took'st a beggar; wouldst have made my throne
322	A seat for baseness.
323	
324	IMOGEN	No; I rather added
325	A lustre to it.
326	
327	CYMBELINE	                  O thou vile one!
328	
329	IMOGEN	Sir,
330	It is your fault that I have loved Posthumus:
331	You bred him as my playfellow, and he is
332	A man worth any woman, overbuys me
333	Almost the sum he pays.
334	
335	CYMBELINE	What, art thou mad?
336	
337	IMOGEN	Almost, sir: heaven restore me! Would I were
338	A neat-herd's daughter, and my Leonatus
339	Our neighbour shepherd's son!
340	
341	CYMBELINE	Thou foolish thing!
342	
343	[Re-enter QUEEN]
344	
345	They were again together: you have done
346	Not after our command. Away with her,
347	And pen her up.
348	
349	QUEEN	                  Beseech your patience. Peace,
350	Dear lady daughter, peace! Sweet sovereign,
351	Leave us to ourselves; and make yourself some comfort
352	Out of your best advice.
353	
354	CYMBELINE	Nay, let her languish
355	A drop of blood a day; and, being aged,
356	Die of this folly!
357	
358	[Exeunt CYMBELINE and Lords]
359	
360	QUEEN	                  Fie! you must give way.
361	
362	[Enter PISANIO]
363	
364	Here is your servant. How now, sir! What news?
365	
366	PISANIO	My lord your son drew on my master.
367	
368	QUEEN	Ha!
369	No harm, I trust, is done?
370	
371	PISANIO	There might have been,
372	But that my master rather play'd than fought
373	And had no help of anger: they were parted
374	By gentlemen at hand.
375	
376	QUEEN	I am very glad on't.
377	
378	IMOGEN	Your son's my father's friend; he takes his part.
379	To draw upon an exile! O brave sir!
380	I would they were in Afric both together;
381	Myself by with a needle, that I might prick
382	The goer-back. Why came you from your master?
383	
384	PISANIO	On his command: he would not suffer me
385	To bring him to the haven; left these notes
386	Of what commands I should be subject to,
387	When 't pleased you to employ me.
388	
389	QUEEN	This hath been
390	Your faithful servant: I dare lay mine honour
391	He will remain so.
392	
393	PISANIO	                  I humbly thank your highness.
394	
395	QUEEN	Pray, walk awhile.
396	
397	IMOGEN	                  About some half-hour hence,
398	I pray you, speak with me: you shall at least
399	Go see my lord aboard: for this time leave me.
400	
401	[Exeunt]

412	
413	SCENE II	The same. A public place.
414	
415	
416	[Enter CLOTEN and two Lords]
417	
418	First Lord	Sir, I would advise you to shift a shirt; the
419	violence of action hath made you reek as a
420	sacrifice: where air comes out, air comes in:
421	there's none abroad so wholesome as that you vent.
422	
423	CLOTEN	If my shirt were bloody, then to shift it. Have I hurt him?
424	
425	Second Lord	[Aside]  No, 'faith; not so much as his patience.
426	
427	First Lord	Hurt him! his body's a passable carcass, if he be
428	not hurt: it is a thoroughfare for steel, if it be not hurt.
429	
430	Second Lord	[Aside]  His steel was in debt; it went o' the
431	backside the town.
432	
433	CLOTEN	The villain would not stand me.
434	
435	Second Lord	[Aside]  No; but he fled forward still, toward your face.
436	
437	First Lord	Stand you! You have land enough of your own: but
438	he added to your having; gave you some ground.
439	
440	Second Lord	[Aside]  As many inches as you have oceans. Puppies!
441	
442	CLOTEN	I would they had not come between us.
443	
444	Second Lord	[Aside]  So would I, till you had measured how long
445	a fool you were upon the ground.
446	
447	CLOTEN	And that she should love this fellow and refuse me!
448	
449	Second Lord	[Aside]  If it be a sin to make a true election, she
450	is damned.
451	
452	First Lord	Sir, as I told you always, her beauty and her brain
453	go not together: she's a good sign, but I have seen
454	small reflection of her wit.
455	
456	Second Lord	[Aside]  She shines not upon fools, lest the
457	reflection should hurt her.
458	
459	CLOTEN	Come, I'll to my chamber. Would there had been some
460	hurt done!
461	
462	Second Lord	[Aside]  I wish not so; unless it had been the fall
463	of an ass, which is no great hurt.
464	
465	CLOTEN	You'll go with us?
466	
467	First Lord	I'll attend your lordship.
468	
469	CLOTEN	Nay, come, let's go together.
470	
471	Second Lord	Well, my lord.
472

484	
485	SCENE III	A room in Cymbeline's palace.
486	
487	
488	[Enter IMOGEN and PISANIO]
489	
490	IMOGEN	I would thou grew'st unto the shores o' the haven,
491	And question'dst every sail: if he should write
492	And not have it, 'twere a paper lost,
493	As offer'd mercy is. What was the last
494	That he spake to thee?
495	
496	PISANIO	It was his queen, his queen!
497	
498	IMOGEN	Then waved his handkerchief?
499	
500	PISANIO	And kiss'd it, madam.
501	
502	IMOGEN	Senseless Linen! happier therein than I!
503	And that was all?
504	
505	PISANIO	                  No, madam; for so long
506	As he could make me with this eye or ear
507	Distinguish him from others, he did keep
508	The deck, with glove, or hat, or handkerchief,
509	Still waving, as the fits and stirs of 's mind
510	Could best express how slow his soul sail'd on,
511	How swift his ship.
512	
513	IMOGEN	Thou shouldst have made him
514	As little as a crow, or less, ere left
515	To after-eye him.
516	
517	PISANIO	                  Madam, so I did.
518	
519	IMOGEN	I would have broke mine eye-strings; crack'd them, but
520	To look upon him, till the diminution
521	Of space had pointed him sharp as my needle,
522	Nay, follow'd him, till he had melted from
523	The smallness of a gnat to air, and then
524	Have turn'd mine eye and wept. But, good Pisanio,
525	When shall we hear from him?
526	
527	PISANIO	Be assured, madam,
528	With his next vantage.
529	
530	IMOGEN	I did not take my leave of him, but had
531	Most pretty things to say: ere I could tell him
532	How I would think on him at certain hours
533	Such thoughts and such, or I could make him swear
534	The shes of Italy should not betray
535	Mine interest and his honour, or have charged him,
536	At the sixth hour of morn, at noon, at midnight,
537	To encounter me with orisons, for then
538	I am in heaven for him; or ere I could
539	Give him that parting kiss which I had set
540	Betwixt two charming words, comes in my father
541	And like the tyrannous breathing of the north
542	Shakes all our buds from growing.
543	
544	[Enter a Lady]
545	
546	Lady	The queen, madam,
547	Desires your highness' company.
548	
549	IMOGEN	Those things I bid you do, get them dispatch'd.
550	I will attend the queen.
551	
552	PISANIO	Madam, I shall.

562	ACT I
563	
564	
565	
566	SCENE IV	Rome. Philario's house.
567	
568	
569	[Enter PHILARIO, IACHIMO, a Frenchman, a
570	Dutchman, and a Spaniard]
571	
572	IACHIMO	Believe it, sir, I have seen him in Britain: he was
573	then of a crescent note, expected to prove so worthy
574	as since he hath been allowed the name of; but I
575	could then have looked on him without the help of
576	admiration, though the catalogue of his endowments
577	had been tabled by his side and I to peruse him by items.
578	
579	PHILARIO	You speak of him when he was less furnished than now
580	he is with that which makes him both without and within.
581	
582	Frenchman	I have seen him in France: we had very many there
583	could behold the sun with as firm eyes as he.
584	
585	IACHIMO	This matter of marrying his king's daughter, wherein
586	he must be weighed rather by her value than his own,
587	words him, I doubt not, a great deal from the matter.
588	
589	Frenchman	And then his banishment.
590	
591	IACHIMO	Ay, and the approbation of those that weep this
592	lamentable divorce under her colours are wonderfully
593	to extend him; be it but to fortify her judgment,
594	which else an easy battery might lay flat, for
595	taking a beggar without less quality. But how comes
596	it he is to sojourn with you? How creeps
597	acquaintance?
598	
599	PHILARIO	His father and I were soldiers together; to whom I
600	have been often bound for no less than my life.
601	Here comes the Briton: let him be so entertained
602	amongst you as suits, with gentlemen of your
603	knowing, to a stranger of his quality.
604	
605	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]
606	
607	I beseech you all, be better known to this
608	gentleman; whom I commend to you as a noble friend
609	of mine: how worthy he is I will leave to appear
610	hereafter, rather than story him in his own hearing.
611	
612	Frenchman	Sir, we have known together in Orleans.
613	
614	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Since when I have been debtor to you for courtesies,
615	which I will be ever to pay and yet pay still.
616	
617	Frenchman	Sir, you o'er-rate my poor kindness: I was glad I
618	did atone my countryman and you; it had been pity
619	you should have been put together with so mortal a
620	purpose as then each bore, upon importance of so
621	slight and trivial a nature.
622	
623	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	By your pardon, sir, I was then a young traveller;
624	rather shunned to go even with what I heard than in
625	my every action to be guided by others' experiences:
626	but upon my mended judgment--if I offend not to say
627	it is mended--my quarrel was not altogether slight.
628	
629	Frenchman	'Faith, yes, to be put to the arbitrement of swords,
630	and by such two that would by all likelihood have
631	confounded one the other, or have fallen both.
632	
633	IACHIMO	Can we, with manners, ask what was the difference?
634	
635	Frenchman	Safely, I think: 'twas a contention in public,
636	which may, without contradiction, suffer the report.
637	It was much like an argument that fell out last
638	night, where each of us fell in praise of our
639	country mistresses; this gentleman at that time
640	vouching--and upon warrant of bloody
641	affirmation--his to be more fair, virtuous, wise,
642	chaste, constant-qualified and less attemptable
643	than any the rarest of our ladies in France.
644	
645	IACHIMO	That lady is not now living, or this gentleman's
646	opinion by this worn out.
647	
648	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	She holds her virtue still and I my mind.
649	
650	IACHIMO	You must not so far prefer her 'fore ours of Italy.
651	
652	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Being so far provoked as I was in France, I would
653	abate her nothing, though I profess myself her
654	adorer, not her friend.
655	
656	IACHIMO	As fair and as good--a kind of hand-in-hand
657	comparison--had been something too fair and too good
658	for any lady in Britain. If she went before others
659	I have seen, as that diamond of yours outlustres
660	many I have beheld. I could not but believe she
661	excelled many: but I have not seen the most
662	precious diamond that is, nor you the lady.
663	
664	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I praised her as I rated her: so do I my stone.
665	
666	IACHIMO	What do you esteem it at?
667	
668	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	More than the world enjoys.
669	
670	IACHIMO	Either your unparagoned mistress is dead, or she's
671	outprized by a trifle.
672	
673	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	You are mistaken: the one may be sold, or given, if
674	there were wealth enough for the purchase, or merit
675	for the gift: the other is not a thing for sale,
676	and only the gift of the gods.
677	
678	IACHIMO	Which the gods have given you?
679	
680	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Which, by their graces, I will keep.
681	
682	IACHIMO	You may wear her in title yours: but, you know,
683	strange fowl light upon neighbouring ponds. Your
684	ring may be stolen too: so your brace of unprizable
685	estimations; the one is but frail and the other
686	casual; a cunning thief, or a that way accomplished
687	courtier, would hazard the winning both of first and last.
688	
689	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Your Italy contains none so accomplished a courtier
690	to convince the honour of my mistress, if, in the
691	holding or loss of that, you term her frail. I do
692	nothing doubt you have store of thieves;
693	notwithstanding, I fear not my ring.
694	
695	PHILARIO	Let us leave here, gentlemen.
696	
697	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Sir, with all my heart. This worthy signior, I
698	thank him, makes no stranger of me; we are familiar at first.
699	
700	IACHIMO	With five times so much conversation, I should get
701	ground of your fair mistress, make her go back, even
702	to the yielding, had I admittance and opportunity to friend.
703	
704	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No, no.
705	
706	IACHIMO	I dare thereupon pawn the moiety of my estate to
707	your ring; which, in my opinion, o'ervalues it
708	something: but I make my wager rather against your
709	confidence than her reputation: and, to bar your
710	offence herein too, I durst attempt it against any
711	lady in the world.
712	
713	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	You are a great deal abused in too bold a
714	persuasion; and I doubt not you sustain what you're
715	worthy of by your attempt.
716	
717	IACHIMO	What's that?
718	
719	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	A repulse: though your attempt, as you call it,
720	deserve more; a punishment too.
721	
722	PHILARIO	Gentlemen, enough of this: it came in too suddenly;
723	let it die as it was born, and, I pray you, be
724	better acquainted.
725	
726	IACHIMO	Would I had put my estate and my neighbour's on the
727	approbation of what I have spoke!
728	
729	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	What lady would you choose to assail?
730	
731	IACHIMO	Yours; whom in constancy you think stands so safe.
732	I will lay you ten thousand ducats to your ring,
733	that, commend me to the court where your lady is,
734	with no more advantage than the opportunity of a
735	second conference, and I will bring from thence
736	that honour of hers which you imagine so reserved.
737	
738	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I will wage against your gold, gold to it: my ring
739	I hold dear as my finger; 'tis part of it.
740	
741	IACHIMO	You are afraid, and therein the wiser. If you buy
742	ladies' flesh at a million a dram, you cannot
743	preserve it from tainting: but I see you have some
744	religion in you, that you fear.
745	
746	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is but a custom in your tongue; you bear a
747	graver purpose, I hope.
748	
749	IACHIMO	I am the master of my speeches, and would undergo
750	what's spoken, I swear.
751	
752	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Will you? I shall but lend my diamond till your
753	return: let there be covenants drawn between's: my
754	mistress exceeds in goodness the hugeness of your
755	unworthy thinking: I dare you to this match: here's my ring.
756	
757	PHILARIO	I will have it no lay.
758	
759	IACHIMO	By the gods, it is one. If I bring you no
760	sufficient testimony that I have enjoyed the dearest
761	bodily part of your mistress, my ten thousand ducats
762	are yours; so is your diamond too: if I come off,
763	and leave her in such honour as you have trust in,
764	she your jewel, this your jewel, and my gold are
765	yours: provided I have your commendation for my more
766	free entertainment.
767	
768	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I embrace these conditions; let us have articles
769	betwixt us. Only, thus far you shall answer: if
770	you make your voyage upon her and give me directly
771	to understand you have prevailed, I am no further
772	your enemy; she is not worth our debate: if she
773	remain unseduced, you not making it appear
774	otherwise, for your ill opinion and the assault you
775	have made to her chastity you shall answer me with
776	your sword.
777	
778	IACHIMO	Your hand; a covenant: we will have these things set
779	down by lawful counsel, and straight away for
780	Britain, lest the bargain should catch cold and
781	starve: I will fetch my gold and have our two
782	wagers recorded.
783	
784	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Agreed.
785	
786	[Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and IACHIMO]
787	
788	Frenchman	Will this hold, think you?
789	
790	PHILARIO	Signior Iachimo will not from it.
791	Pray, let us follow 'em.
792

798	CYMBELINE
799	
800	
801	ACT I
802	
803	
804	
805	SCENE V	Britain. A room in Cymbeline's palace.
806	
807	
808	[Enter QUEEN, Ladies, and CORNELIUS]
809	
810	QUEEN	Whiles yet the dew's on ground, gather those flowers;
811	Make haste: who has the note of them?
812	
813	First Lady	I, madam.
814	
815	QUEEN	Dispatch.
816	
817	[Exeunt Ladies]
818	
819	Now, master doctor, have you brought those drugs?
820	
821	CORNELIUS	Pleaseth your highness, ay: here they are, madam:
822	
823	[Presenting a small box]
824	
825	But I beseech your grace, without offence,--
826	My conscience bids me ask--wherefore you have
827	Commanded of me those most poisonous compounds,
828	Which are the movers of a languishing death;
829	But though slow, deadly?
830	
831	QUEEN	I wonder, doctor,
832	Thou ask'st me such a question. Have I not been
833	Thy pupil long? Hast thou not learn'd me how
834	To make perfumes? distil? preserve? yea, so
835	That our great king himself doth woo me oft
836	For my confections? Having thus far proceeded,--
837	Unless thou think'st me devilish--is't not meet
838	That I did amplify my judgment in
839	Other conclusions? I will try the forces
840	Of these thy compounds on such creatures as
841	We count not worth the hanging, but none human,
842	To try the vigour of them and apply
843	Allayments to their act, and by them gather
844	Their several virtues and effects.
845	
846	CORNELIUS	Your highness
847	Shall from this practise but make hard your heart:
848	Besides, the seeing these effects will be
849	Both noisome and infectious.
850	
851	QUEEN	O, content thee.
852	
853	[Enter PISANIO]
854	
855	[Aside]
856	
857	Here comes a flattering rascal; upon him
858	Will I first work: he's for his master,
859	An enemy to my son. How now, Pisanio!
860	Doctor, your service for this time is ended;
861	Take your own way.
862	
863	CORNELIUS	[Aside]          I do suspect you, madam;
864	But you shall do no harm.
865	
866	QUEEN	[To PISANIO]            Hark thee, a word.
867	
868	CORNELIUS	[Aside]  I do not like her. She doth think she has
869	Strange lingering poisons: I do know her spirit,
870	And will not trust one of her malice with
871	A drug of such damn'd nature. Those she has
872	Will stupefy and dull the sense awhile;
873	Which first, perchance, she'll prove on
874	cats and dogs,
875	Then afterward up higher: but there is
876	No danger in what show of death it makes,
877	More than the locking-up the spirits a time,
878	To be more fresh, reviving. She is fool'd
879	With a most false effect; and I the truer,
880	So to be false with her.
881	
882	QUEEN	No further service, doctor,
883	Until I send for thee.
884	
885	CORNELIUS	I humbly take my leave.
886	
887	[Exit]
888	
889	QUEEN	Weeps she still, say'st thou? Dost thou think in time
890	She will not quench and let instructions enter
891	Where folly now possesses? Do thou work:
892	When thou shalt bring me word she loves my son,
893	I'll tell thee on the instant thou art then
894	As great as is thy master, greater, for
895	His fortunes all lie speechless and his name
896	Is at last gasp: return he cannot, nor
897	Continue where he is: to shift his being
898	Is to exchange one misery with another,
899	And every day that comes comes to decay
900	A day's work in him. What shalt thou expect,
901	To be depender on a thing that leans,
902	Who cannot be new built, nor has no friends,
903	So much as but to prop him?
904	
905	[The QUEEN drops the box: PISANIO takes it up]
906	
907	Thou takest up
908	Thou know'st not what; but take it for thy labour:
909	It is a thing I made, which hath the king
910	Five times redeem'd from death: I do not know
911	What is more cordial. Nay, I prethee, take it;
912	It is an earnest of a further good
913	That I mean to thee. Tell thy mistress how
914	The case stands with her; do't as from thyself.
915	Think what a chance thou changest on, but think
916	Thou hast thy mistress still, to boot, my son,
917	Who shall take notice of thee: I'll move the king
918	To any shape of thy preferment such
919	As thou'lt desire; and then myself, I chiefly,
920	That set thee on to this desert, am bound
921	To load thy merit richly. Call my women:
922	Think on my words.
923	
924	[Exit PISANIO]
925	
926	A sly and constant knave,
927	Not to be shaked; the agent for his master
928	And the remembrancer of her to hold
929	The hand-fast to her lord. I have given him that
930	Which, if he take, shall quite unpeople her
931	Of liegers for her sweet, and which she after,
932	Except she bend her humour, shall be assured
933	To taste of too.
934	
935	[Re-enter PISANIO and Ladies]
936	
937	So, so: well done, well done:
938	The violets, cowslips, and the primroses,
939	Bear to my closet. Fare thee well, Pisanio;
940	Think on my words.
941	
942	[Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies]
943	
944	PISANIO	And shall do:
945	But when to my good lord I prove untrue,
946	I'll choke myself: there's all I'll do for you.
947	
948	[Exit]
949

953	CYMBELINE
954	
955	
956	ACT I
957	
958	
959	
960	SCENE VI	The same. Another room in the palace.
961	
962	
963	[Enter IMOGEN]
964	
965	IMOGEN	A father cruel, and a step-dame false;
966	A foolish suitor to a wedded lady,
967	That hath her husband banish'd;--O, that husband!
968	My supreme crown of grief! and those repeated
969	Vexations of it! Had I been thief-stol'n,
970	As my two brothers, happy! but most miserable
971	Is the desire that's glorious: blest be those,
972	How mean soe'er, that have their honest wills,
973	Which seasons comfort. Who may this be? Fie!
974	
975	[Enter PISANIO and IACHIMO]
976	
977	PISANIO	Madam, a noble gentleman of Rome,
978	Comes from my lord with letters.
979	
980	IACHIMO	Change you, madam?
981	The worthy Leonatus is in safety
982	And greets your highness dearly.
983	
984	[Presents a letter]
985	
986	IMOGEN	Thanks, good sir:
987	You're kindly welcome.
988	
989	IACHIMO	[Aside]  All of her that is out of door most rich!
990	If she be furnish'd with a mind so rare,
991	She is alone the Arabian bird, and I
992	Have lost the wager. Boldness be my friend!
993	Arm me, audacity, from head to foot!
994	Or, like the Parthian, I shall flying fight;
995	Rather directly fly.
996	
997	IMOGEN	[Reads]  'He is one of the noblest note, to whose
998	kindnesses I am most infinitely tied. Reflect upon
999	him accordingly, as you value your trust--
1000	LEONATUS.'
1001	So far I read aloud:
1002	But even the very middle of my heart
1003	Is warm'd by the rest, and takes it thankfully.
1004	You are as welcome, worthy sir, as I
1005	Have words to bid you, and shall find it so
1006	In all that I can do.
1007	
1008	IACHIMO	Thanks, fairest lady.
1009	What, are men mad? Hath nature given them eyes
1010	To see this vaulted arch, and the rich crop
1011	Of sea and land, which can distinguish 'twixt
1012	The fiery orbs above and the twinn'd stones
1013	Upon the number'd beach? and can we not
1014	Partition make with spectacles so precious
1015	'Twixt fair and foul?
1016	
1017	IMOGEN	What makes your admiration?
1018	
1019	IACHIMO	It cannot be i' the eye, for apes and monkeys
1020	'Twixt two such shes would chatter this way and
1021	Contemn with mows the other; nor i' the judgment,
1022	For idiots in this case of favour would
1023	Be wisely definite; nor i' the appetite;
1024	Sluttery to such neat excellence opposed
1025	Should make desire vomit emptiness,
1026	Not so allured to feed.
1027	
1028	IMOGEN	What is the matter, trow?
1029	
1030	IACHIMO	The cloyed will,
1031	That satiate yet unsatisfied desire, that tub
1032	Both fill'd and running, ravening first the lamb
1033	Longs after for the garbage.
1034	
1035	IMOGEN	What, dear sir,
1036	Thus raps you? Are you well?
1037	
1038	IACHIMO	Thanks, madam; well.
1039	
1040	[To PISANIO]
1041	
1042	Beseech you, sir, desire
1043	My man's abode where I did leave him: he
1044	Is strange and peevish.
1045	
1046	PISANIO	I was going, sir,
1047	To give him welcome.
1048	
1049	[Exit]
1050	
1051	IMOGEN	Continues well my lord? His health, beseech you?
1052	
1053	IACHIMO	Well, madam.
1054	
1055	IMOGEN	Is he disposed to mirth? I hope he is.
1056	
1057	IACHIMO	Exceeding pleasant; none a stranger there
1058	So merry and so gamesome: he is call'd
1059	The Briton reveller.
1060	
1061	IMOGEN	When he was here,
1062	He did incline to sadness, and oft-times
1063	Not knowing why.
1064	
1065	IACHIMO	                  I never saw him sad.
1066	There is a Frenchman his companion, one
1067	An eminent monsieur, that, it seems, much loves
1068	A Gallian girl at home; he furnaces
1069	The thick sighs from him, whiles the jolly Briton--
1070	Your lord, I mean--laughs from's free lungs, cries 'O,
1071	Can my sides hold, to think that man, who knows
1072	By history, report, or his own proof,
1073	What woman is, yea, what she cannot choose
1074	But must be, will his free hours languish for
1075	Assured bondage?'
1076	
1077	IMOGEN	                  Will my lord say so?
1078	
1079	IACHIMO	Ay, madam, with his eyes in flood with laughter:
1080	It is a recreation to be by
1081	And hear him mock the Frenchman. But, heavens know,
1082	Some men are much to blame.
1083	
1084	IMOGEN	Not he, I hope.
1085	
1086	IACHIMO	Not he: but yet heaven's bounty towards him might
1087	Be used more thankfully. In himself, 'tis much;
1088	In you, which I account his beyond all talents,
1089	Whilst I am bound to wonder, I am bound
1090	To pity too.
1091	
1092	IMOGEN	                  What do you pity, sir?
1093	
1094	IACHIMO	Two creatures heartily.
1095	
1096	IMOGEN	Am I one, sir?
1097	You look on me: what wreck discern you in me
1098	Deserves your pity?
1099	
1100	IACHIMO	Lamentable! What,
1101	To hide me from the radiant sun and solace
1102	I' the dungeon by a snuff?
1103	
1104	IMOGEN	I pray you, sir,
1105	Deliver with more openness your answers
1106	To my demands. Why do you pity me?
1107	
1108	IACHIMO	That others do--
1109	I was about to say--enjoy your--But
1110	It is an office of the gods to venge it,
1111	Not mine to speak on 't.
1112	
1113	IMOGEN	You do seem to know
1114	Something of me, or what concerns me: pray you,--
1115	Since doubling things go ill often hurts more
1116	Than to be sure they do; for certainties
1117	Either are past remedies, or, timely knowing,
1118	The remedy then born--discover to me
1119	What both you spur and stop.
1120	
1121	IACHIMO	Had I this cheek
1122	To bathe my lips upon; this hand, whose touch,
1123	Whose every touch, would force the feeler's soul
1124	To the oath of loyalty; this object, which
1125	Takes prisoner the wild motion of mine eye,
1126	Fixing it only here; should I, damn'd then,
1127	Slaver with lips as common as the stairs
1128	That mount the Capitol; join gripes with hands
1129	Made hard with hourly falsehood--falsehood, as
1130	With labour; then by-peeping in an eye
1131	Base and unlustrous as the smoky light
1132	That's fed with stinking tallow; it were fit
1133	That all the plagues of hell should at one time
1134	Encounter such revolt.
1135	
1136	IMOGEN	My lord, I fear,
1137	Has forgot Britain.
1138	
1139	IACHIMO	And himself. Not I,
1140	Inclined to this intelligence, pronounce
1141	The beggary of his change; but 'tis your graces
1142	That from pay mutest conscience to my tongue
1143	Charms this report out.
1144	
1145	IMOGEN	Let me hear no more.
1146	
1147	IACHIMO	O dearest soul! your cause doth strike my heart
1148	With pity, that doth make me sick. A lady
1149	So fair, and fasten'd to an empery,
1150	Would make the great'st king double,--to be partner'd
1151	With tomboys hired with that self-exhibition
1152	Which your own coffers yield! with diseased ventures
1153	That play with all infirmities for gold
1154	Which rottenness can lend nature! such boil'd stuff
1155	As well might poison poison! Be revenged;
1156	Or she that bore you was no queen, and you
1157	Recoil from your great stock.
1158	
1159	IMOGEN	Revenged!
1160	How should I be revenged? If this be true,--
1161	As I have such a heart that both mine ears
1162	Must not in haste abuse--if it be true,
1163	How should I be revenged?
1164	
1165	IACHIMO	Should he make me
1166	Live, like Diana's priest, betwixt cold sheets,
1167	Whiles he is vaulting variable ramps,
1168	In your despite, upon your purse? Revenge it.
1169	I dedicate myself to your sweet pleasure,
1170	More noble than that runagate to your bed,
1171	And will continue fast to your affection,
1172	Still close as sure.
1173	
1174	IMOGEN	What, ho, Pisanio!
1175	
1176	IACHIMO	Let me my service tender on your lips.
1177	
1178	IMOGEN	Away! I do condemn mine ears that have
1179	So long attended thee. If thou wert honourable,
1180	Thou wouldst have told this tale for virtue, not
1181	For such an end thou seek'st,--as base as strange.
1182	Thou wrong'st a gentleman, who is as far
1183	From thy report as thou from honour, and
1184	Solicit'st here a lady that disdains
1185	Thee and the devil alike. What ho, Pisanio!
1186	The king my father shall be made acquainted
1187	Of thy assault: if he shall think it fit,
1188	A saucy stranger in his court to mart
1189	As in a Romish stew and to expound
1190	His beastly mind to us, he hath a court
1191	He little cares for and a daughter who
1192	He not respects at all. What, ho, Pisanio!
1193	
1194	IACHIMO	O happy Leonatus! I may say
1195	The credit that thy lady hath of thee
1196	Deserves thy trust, and thy most perfect goodness
1197	Her assured credit. Blessed live you long!
1198	A lady to the worthiest sir that ever
1199	Country call'd his! and you his mistress, only
1200	For the most worthiest fit! Give me your pardon.
1201	I have spoke this, to know if your affiance
1202	Were deeply rooted; and shall make your lord,
1203	That which he is, new o'er: and he is one
1204	The truest manner'd; such a holy witch
1205	That he enchants societies into him;
1206	Half all men's hearts are his.
1207	
1208	IMOGEN	You make amends.
1209	
1210	IACHIMO	He sits 'mongst men like a descended god:
1211	He hath a kind of honour sets him off,
1212	More than a mortal seeming. Be not angry,
1213	Most mighty princess, that I have adventured
1214	To try your taking a false report; which hath
1215	Honour'd with confirmation your great judgment
1216	In the election of a sir so rare,
1217	Which you know cannot err: the love I bear him
1218	Made me to fan you thus, but the gods made you,
1219	Unlike all others, chaffless. Pray, your pardon.
1220	
1221	IMOGEN	All's well, sir: take my power i' the court
1222	for yours.
1223	
1224	IACHIMO	My humble thanks. I had almost forgot
1225	To entreat your grace but in a small request,
1226	And yet of moment to, for it concerns
1227	Your lord; myself and other noble friends,
1228	Are partners in the business.
1229	
1230	IMOGEN	Pray, what is't?
1231	
1232	IACHIMO	Some dozen Romans of us and your lord--
1233	The best feather of our wing--have mingled sums
1234	To buy a present for the emperor
1235	Which I, the factor for the rest, have done
1236	In France: 'tis plate of rare device, and jewels
1237	Of rich and exquisite form; their values great;
1238	And I am something curious, being strange,
1239	To have them in safe stowage: may it please you
1240	To take them in protection?
1241	
1242	IMOGEN	Willingly;
1243	And pawn mine honour for their safety: since
1244	My lord hath interest in them, I will keep them
1245	In my bedchamber.
1246	
1247	IACHIMO	They are in a trunk,
1248	Attended by my men: I will make bold
1249	To send them to you, only for this night;
1250	I must aboard to-morrow.
1251	
1252	IMOGEN	O, no, no.
1253	
1254	IACHIMO	Yes, I beseech; or I shall short my word
1255	By lengthening my return. From Gallia
1256	I cross'd the seas on purpose and on promise
1257	To see your grace.
1258	
1259	IMOGEN	I thank you for your pains:
1260	But not away to-morrow!
1261	
1262	IACHIMO	O, I must, madam:
1263	Therefore I shall beseech you, if you please
1264	To greet your lord with writing, do't to-night:
1265	I have outstood my time; which is material
1266	To the tender of our present.
1267	
1268	IMOGEN	I will write.
1269	Send your trunk to me; it shall safe be kept,
1270	And truly yielded you. You're very welcome.

1282	
1283	
1284	SCENE I	Britain. Before Cymbeline's palace.
1285	
1286	
1287	[Enter CLOTEN and two Lords]
1288	
1289	CLOTEN	Was there ever man had such luck! when I kissed the
1290	jack, upon an up-cast to be hit away! I had a
1291	hundred pound on't: and then a whoreson jackanapes
1292	must take me up for swearing; as if I borrowed mine
1293	oaths of him and might not spend them at my pleasure.
1294	
1295	First Lord	What got he by that? You have broke his pate with
1296	your bowl.
1297	
1298	Second Lord	[Aside]  If his wit had been like him that broke it,
1299	it would have run all out.
1300	
1301	CLOTEN	When a gentleman is disposed to swear, it is not for
1302	any standers-by to curtail his oaths, ha?
1303	
1304	Second Lord	No my lord;
1305	
1306	[Aside]
1307	
1308	nor crop the ears of them.
1309	
1310	CLOTEN	Whoreson dog! I give him satisfaction?
1311	Would he had been one of my rank!
1312	
1313	Second Lord	[Aside]  To have smelt like a fool.
1314	
1315	CLOTEN	I am not vexed more at any thing in the earth: a
1316	pox on't! I had rather not be so noble as I am;
1317	they dare not fight with me, because of the queen my
1318	mother: every Jack-slave hath his bellyful of
1319	fighting, and I must go up and down like a cock that
1320	nobody can match.
1321	
1322	Second Lord	[Aside]  You are cock and capon too; and you crow,
1323	cock, with your comb on.
1324	
1325	CLOTEN	Sayest thou?
1326	
1327	Second Lord	It is not fit your lordship should undertake every
1328	companion that you give offence to.
1329	
1330	CLOTEN	No, I know that: but it is fit I should commit
1331	offence to my inferiors.
1332	
1333	Second Lord	Ay, it is fit for your lordship only.
1334	
1335	CLOTEN	Why, so I say.
1336	
1337	First Lord	Did you hear of a stranger that's come to court to-night?
1338	
1339	CLOTEN	A stranger, and I not know on't!
1340	
1341	Second Lord	[Aside]  He's a strange fellow himself, and knows it
1342	not.
1343	
1344	First Lord	There's an Italian come; and, 'tis thought, one of
1345	Leonatus' friends.
1346	
1347	CLOTEN	Leonatus! a banished rascal; and he's another,
1348	whatsoever he be. Who told you of this stranger?
1349	
1350	First Lord	One of your lordship's pages.
1351	
1352	CLOTEN	Is it fit I went to look upon him? is there no
1353	derogation in't?
1354	
1355	Second Lord	You cannot derogate, my lord.
1356	
1357	CLOTEN	Not easily, I think.
1358	
1359	Second Lord	[Aside]  You are a fool granted; therefore your
1360	issues, being foolish, do not derogate.
1361	
1362	CLOTEN	Come, I'll go see this Italian: what I have lost
1363	to-day at bowls I'll win to-night of him. Come, go.
1364	
1365	Second Lord	I'll attend your lordship.
1366	
1367	[Exeunt CLOTEN and First Lord]
1368	
1369	That such a crafty devil as is his mother
1370	Should yield the world this ass! a woman that
1371	Bears all down with her brain; and this her son
1372	Cannot take two from twenty, for his heart,
1373	And leave eighteen. Alas, poor princess,
1374	Thou divine Imogen, what thou endurest,
1375	Betwixt a father by thy step-dame govern'd,
1376	A mother hourly coining plots, a wooer
1377	More hateful than the foul expulsion is
1378	Of thy dear husband, than that horrid act
1379	Of the divorce he'ld make! The heavens hold firm
1380	The walls of thy dear honour, keep unshaked
1381	That temple, thy fair mind, that thou mayst stand,
1382	To enjoy thy banish'd lord and this great land!

1395	
1396	SCENE II	Imogen's bedchamber in Cymbeline's palace:
1397	a trunk in one corner of it.
1398	
1399	
1400	[IMOGEN in bed, reading; a Lady attending]
1401	
1402	IMOGEN	Who's there? my woman Helen?
1403	
1404	Lady	Please you, madam
1405	
1406	IMOGEN	What hour is it?
1407	
1408	Lady	                  Almost midnight, madam.
1409	
1410	IMOGEN	I have read three hours then: mine eyes are weak:
1411	Fold down the leaf where I have left: to bed:
1412	Take not away the taper, leave it burning;
1413	And if thou canst awake by four o' the clock,
1414	I prithee, call me. Sleep hath seized me wholly
1415	
1416	[Exit Lady]
1417	
1418	To your protection I commend me, gods.
1419	From fairies and the tempters of the night
1420	Guard me, beseech ye.
1421	
1422	[Sleeps. IACHIMO comes from the trunk]
1423	
1424	IACHIMO	The crickets sing, and man's o'er-labour'd sense
1425	Repairs itself by rest. Our Tarquin thus
1426	Did softly press the rushes, ere he waken'd
1427	The chastity he wounded. Cytherea,
1428	How bravely thou becomest thy bed, fresh lily,
1429	And whiter than the sheets! That I might touch!
1430	But kiss; one kiss! Rubies unparagon'd,
1431	How dearly they do't! 'Tis her breathing that
1432	Perfumes the chamber thus: the flame o' the taper
1433	Bows toward her, and would under-peep her lids,
1434	To see the enclosed lights, now canopied
1435	Under these windows, white and azure laced
1436	With blue of heaven's own tinct. But my design,
1437	To note the chamber: I will write all down:
1438	Such and such pictures; there the window; such
1439	The adornment of her bed; the arras; figures,
1440	Why, such and such; and the contents o' the story.
1441	Ah, but some natural notes about her body,
1442	Above ten thousand meaner moveables
1443	Would testify, to enrich mine inventory.
1444	O sleep, thou ape of death, lie dull upon her!
1445	And be her sense but as a monument,
1446	Thus in a chapel lying! Come off, come off:
1447	
1448	[Taking off her bracelet]
1449	
1450	As slippery as the Gordian knot was hard!
1451	'Tis mine; and this will witness outwardly,
1452	As strongly as the conscience does within,
1453	To the madding of her lord. On her left breast
1454	A mole cinque-spotted, like the crimson drops
1455	I' the bottom of a cowslip: here's a voucher,
1456	Stronger than ever law could make: this secret
1457	Will force him think I have pick'd the lock and ta'en
1458	The treasure of her honour. No more. To what end?
1459	Why should I write this down, that's riveted,
1460	Screw'd to my memory? She hath been reading late
1461	The tale of Tereus; here the leaf's turn'd down
1462	Where Philomel gave up. I have enough:
1463	To the trunk again, and shut the spring of it.
1464	Swift, swift, you dragons of the night, that dawning
1465	May bare the raven's eye! I lodge in fear;
1466	Though this a heavenly angel, hell is here.
1467	
1468	[Clock strikes]
1469	
1470	One, two, three: time, time!

1485	
1486	
1487	[Enter CLOTEN and Lords]
1488	
1489	First Lord	Your lordship is the most patient man in loss, the
1490	most coldest that ever turned up ace.
1491	
1492	CLOTEN	It would make any man cold to lose.
1493	
1494	First Lord	But not every man patient after the noble temper of
1495	your lordship. You are most hot and furious when you win.
1496	
1497	CLOTEN	Winning will put any man into courage. If I could
1498	get this foolish Imogen, I should have gold enough.
1499	It's almost morning, is't not?
1500	
1501	First Lord	Day, my lord.
1502	
1503	CLOTEN	I would this music would come: I am advised to give
1504	her music o' mornings; they say it will penetrate.
1505	
1506	[Enter Musicians]
1507	
1508	Come on; tune: if you can penetrate her with your
1509	fingering, so; we'll try with tongue too: if none
1510	will do, let her remain; but I'll never give o'er.
1511	First, a very excellent good-conceited thing;
1512	after, a wonderful sweet air, with admirable rich
1513	words to it: and then let her consider.
1514	[SONG]
1515	
1516	Hark, hark! the lark at heaven's gate sings,
1517	And Phoebus 'gins arise,
1518	His steeds to water at those springs
1519	On chaliced flowers that lies;
1520	And winking Mary-buds begin
1521	To ope their golden eyes:
1522	With every thing that pretty is,
1523	My lady sweet, arise:
1524	Arise, arise.
1525	
1526	CLOTEN	So, get you gone. If this penetrate, I will
1527	consider your music the better: if it do not, it is
1528	a vice in her ears, which horse-hairs and
1529	calves'-guts, nor the voice of unpaved eunuch to
1530	boot, can never amend.
1531	
1532	[Exeunt Musicians]
1533	
1534	Second Lord	Here comes the king.
1535	
1536	CLOTEN	I am glad I was up so late; for that's the reason I
1537	was up so early: he cannot choose but take this
1538	service I have done fatherly.
1539	
1540	[Enter CYMBELINE and QUEEN]
1541	
1542	Good morrow to your majesty and to my gracious mother.
1543	
1544	CYMBELINE	Attend you here the door of our stern daughter?
1545	Will she not forth?
1546	
1547	CLOTEN	I have assailed her with music, but she vouchsafes no notice.
1548	
1549	CYMBELINE	The exile of her minion is too new;
1550	She hath not yet forgot him: some more time
1551	Must wear the print of his remembrance out,
1552	And then she's yours.
1553	
1554	QUEEN	You are most bound to the king,
1555	Who lets go by no vantages that may
1556	Prefer you to his daughter. Frame yourself
1557	To orderly soliciting, and be friended
1558	With aptness of the season; make denials
1559	Increase your services; so seem as if
1560	You were inspired to do those duties which
1561	You tender to her; that you in all obey her,
1562	Save when command to your dismission tends,
1563	And therein you are senseless.
1564	
1565	CLOTEN	Senseless! not so.
1566	
1567	[Enter a Messenger]
1568	
1569	Messenger	So like you, sir, ambassadors from Rome;
1570	The one is Caius Lucius.
1571	
1572	CYMBELINE	A worthy fellow,
1573	Albeit he comes on angry purpose now;
1574	But that's no fault of his: we must receive him
1575	According to the honour of his sender;
1576	And towards himself, his goodness forespent on us,
1577	We must extend our notice. Our dear son,
1578	When you have given good morning to your mistress,
1579	Attend the queen and us; we shall have need
1580	To employ you towards this Roman. Come, our queen.
1581	
1582	[Exeunt all but CLOTEN]
1583	
1584	CLOTEN	If she be up, I'll speak with her; if not,
1585	Let her lie still and dream.
1586	
1587	[Knocks]
1588	
1589	By your leave, ho!
1590	I Know her women are about her: what
1591	If I do line one of their hands? 'Tis gold
1592	Which buys admittance; oft it doth; yea, and makes
1593	Diana's rangers false themselves, yield up
1594	Their deer to the stand o' the stealer; and 'tis gold
1595	Which makes the true man kill'd and saves the thief;
1596	Nay, sometime hangs both thief and true man: what
1597	Can it not do and undo? I will make
1598	One of her women lawyer to me, for
1599	I yet not understand the case myself.
1600	
1601	[Knocks]
1602	
1603	By your leave.
1604	
1605	[Enter a Lady]
1606	
1607	Lady	Who's there that knocks?
1608	
1609	CLOTEN	A gentleman.
1610	
1611	Lady	No more?
1612	
1613	CLOTEN	Yes, and a gentlewoman's son.
1614	
1615	Lady	That's more
1616	Than some, whose tailors are as dear as yours,
1617	Can justly boast of. What's your lordship's pleasure?
1618	
1619	CLOTEN	Your lady's person: is she ready?
1620	
1621	Lady	Ay,
1622	To keep her chamber.
1623	
1624	CLOTEN	There is gold for you;
1625	Sell me your good report.
1626	
1627	Lady	How! my good name? or to report of you
1628	What I shall think is good?--The princess!
1629	
1630	[Enter IMOGEN]
1631	
1632	CLOTEN	Good morrow, fairest: sister, your sweet hand.
1633	
1634	[Exit Lady]
1635	
1636	IMOGEN	Good morrow, sir. You lay out too much pains
1637	For purchasing but trouble; the thanks I give
1638	Is telling you that I am poor of thanks
1639	And scarce can spare them.
1640	
1641	CLOTEN	Still, I swear I love you.
1642	
1643	IMOGEN	If you but said so, 'twere as deep with me:
1644	If you swear still, your recompense is still
1645	That I regard it not.
1646	
1647	CLOTEN	This is no answer.
1648	
1649	IMOGEN	But that you shall not say I yield being silent,
1650	I would not speak. I pray you, spare me: 'faith,
1651	I shall unfold equal discourtesy
1652	To your best kindness: one of your great knowing
1653	Should learn, being taught, forbearance.
1654	
1655	CLOTEN	To leave you in your madness, 'twere my sin:
1656	I will not.
1657	
1658	IMOGEN	          Fools are not mad folks.
1659	
1660	CLOTEN	Do you call me fool?
1661	
1662	IMOGEN	As I am mad, I do:
1663	If you'll be patient, I'll no more be mad;
1664	That cures us both. I am much sorry, sir,
1665	You put me to forget a lady's manners,
1666	By being so verbal: and learn now, for all,
1667	That I, which know my heart, do here pronounce,
1668	By the very truth of it, I care not for you,
1669	And am so near the lack of charity--
1670	To accuse myself--I hate you; which I had rather
1671	You felt than make't my boast.
1672	
1673	CLOTEN	You sin against
1674	Obedience, which you owe your father. For
1675	The contract you pretend with that base wretch,
1676	One bred of alms and foster'd with cold dishes,
1677	With scraps o' the court, it is no contract, none:
1678	And though it be allow'd in meaner parties--
1679	Yet who than he more mean?--to knit their souls,
1680	On whom there is no more dependency
1681	But brats and beggary, in self-figured knot;
1682	Yet you are curb'd from that enlargement by
1683	The consequence o' the crown, and must not soil
1684	The precious note of it with a base slave.
1685	A hilding for a livery, a squire's cloth,
1686	A pantler, not so eminent.
1687	
1688	IMOGEN	Profane fellow
1689	Wert thou the son of Jupiter and no more
1690	But what thou art besides, thou wert too base
1691	To be his groom: thou wert dignified enough,
1692	Even to the point of envy, if 'twere made
1693	Comparative for your virtues, to be styled
1694	The under-hangman of his kingdom, and hated
1695	For being preferred so well.
1696	
1697	CLOTEN	The south-fog rot him!
1698	
1699	IMOGEN	He never can meet more mischance than come
1700	To be but named of thee. His meanest garment,
1701	That ever hath but clipp'd his body, is dearer
1702	In my respect than all the hairs above thee,
1703	Were they all made such men. How now, Pisanio!
1704	
1705	[Enter PISANIO]
1706	
1707	CLOTEN	'His garment!' Now the devil--
1708	
1709	IMOGEN	To Dorothy my woman hie thee presently--
1710	
1711	CLOTEN	'His garment!'
1712	
1713	IMOGEN	                  I am sprited with a fool.
1714	Frighted, and anger'd worse: go bid my woman
1715	Search for a jewel that too casually
1716	Hath left mine arm: it was thy master's: 'shrew me,
1717	If I would lose it for a revenue
1718	Of any king's in Europe. I do think
1719	I saw't this morning: confident I am
1720	Last night 'twas on mine arm; I kiss'd it:
1721	I hope it be not gone to tell my lord
1722	That I kiss aught but he.
1723	
1724	PISANIO	'Twill not be lost.
1725	
1726	IMOGEN	I hope so: go and search.
1727	
1728	[Exit PISANIO]
1729	
1730	CLOTEN	You have abused me:
1731	'His meanest garment!'
1732	
1733	IMOGEN	Ay, I said so, sir:
1734	If you will make't an action, call witness to't.
1735	
1736	CLOTEN	I will inform your father.
1737	
1738	IMOGEN	Your mother too:
1739	She's my good lady, and will conceive, I hope,
1740	But the worst of me. So, I leave you, sir,
1741	To the worst of discontent.
1742	
1743	[Exit]
1744	
1745	CLOTEN	I'll be revenged:
1746	'His meanest garment!' Well.

1755	ACT II
1756	
1757	
1758	
1759	SCENE IV	Rome. Philario's house.
1760	
1761	
1762	[Enter POSTHUMUS and PHILARIO]
1763	
1764	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Fear it not, sir: I would I were so sure
1765	To win the king as I am bold her honour
1766	Will remain hers.
1767	
1768	PHILARIO	                  What means do you make to him?
1769	
1770	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Not any, but abide the change of time,
1771	Quake in the present winter's state and wish
1772	That warmer days would come: in these sear'd hopes,
1773	I barely gratify your love; they failing,
1774	I must die much your debtor.
1775	
1776	PHILARIO	Your very goodness and your company
1777	O'erpays all I can do. By this, your king
1778	Hath heard of great Augustus: Caius Lucius
1779	Will do's commission throughly: and I think
1780	He'll grant the tribute, send the arrearages,
1781	Or look upon our Romans, whose remembrance
1782	Is yet fresh in their grief.
1783	
1784	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I do believe,
1785	Statist though I am none, nor like to be,
1786	That this will prove a war; and you shall hear
1787	The legions now in Gallia sooner landed
1788	In our not-fearing Britain than have tidings
1789	Of any penny tribute paid. Our countrymen
1790	Are men more order'd than when Julius Caesar
1791	Smiled at their lack of skill, but found
1792	their courage
1793	Worthy his frowning at: their discipline,
1794	Now mingled with their courages, will make known
1795	To their approvers they are people such
1796	That mend upon the world.
1797	
1798	[Enter IACHIMO]
1799	
1800	PHILARIO	See! Iachimo!
1801	
1802	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The swiftest harts have posted you by land;
1803	And winds of all the comers kiss'd your sails,
1804	To make your vessel nimble.
1805	
1806	PHILARIO	Welcome, sir.
1807	
1808	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I hope the briefness of your answer made
1809	The speediness of your return.
1810	
1811	IACHIMO	Your lady
1812	Is one of the fairest that I have look'd upon.
1813	
1814	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	And therewithal the best; or let her beauty
1815	Look through a casement to allure false hearts
1816	And be false with them.
1817	
1818	IACHIMO	Here are letters for you.
1819	
1820	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Their tenor good, I trust.
1821	
1822	IACHIMO	'Tis very like.
1823	
1824	PHILARIO	Was Caius Lucius in the Britain court
1825	When you were there?
1826	
1827	IACHIMO	He was expected then,
1828	But not approach'd.
1829	
1830	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	All is well yet.
1831	Sparkles this stone as it was wont? or is't not
1832	Too dull for your good wearing?
1833	
1834	IACHIMO	If I had lost it,
1835	I should have lost the worth of it in gold.
1836	I'll make a journey twice as far, to enjoy
1837	A second night of such sweet shortness which
1838	Was mine in Britain, for the ring is won.
1839	
1840	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	The stone's too hard to come by.
1841	
1842	IACHIMO	Not a whit,
1843	Your lady being so easy.
1844	
1845	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Make not, sir,
1846	Your loss your sport: I hope you know that we
1847	Must not continue friends.
1848	
1849	IACHIMO	Good sir, we must,
1850	If you keep covenant. Had I not brought
1851	The knowledge of your mistress home, I grant
1852	We were to question further: but I now
1853	Profess myself the winner of her honour,
1854	Together with your ring; and not the wronger
1855	Of her or you, having proceeded but
1856	By both your wills.
1857	
1858	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	If you can make't apparent
1859	That you have tasted her in bed, my hand
1860	And ring is yours; if not, the foul opinion
1861	You had of her pure honour gains or loses
1862	Your sword or mine, or masterless leaves both
1863	To who shall find them.
1864	
1865	IACHIMO	Sir, my circumstances,
1866	Being so near the truth as I will make them,
1867	Must first induce you to believe: whose strength
1868	I will confirm with oath; which, I doubt not,
1869	You'll give me leave to spare, when you shall find
1870	You need it not.
1871	
1872	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	                  Proceed.
1873	
1874	IACHIMO	First, her bedchamber,--
1875	Where, I confess, I slept not, but profess
1876	Had that was well worth watching--it was hang'd
1877	With tapesty of silk and silver; the story
1878	Proud Cleopatra, when she met her Roman,
1879	And Cydnus swell'd above the banks, or for
1880	The press of boats or pride: a piece of work
1881	So bravely done, so rich, that it did strive
1882	In workmanship and value; which I wonder'd
1883	Could be so rarely and exactly wrought,
1884	Since the true life on't was--
1885	
1886	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is true;
1887	And this you might have heard of here, by me,
1888	Or by some other.
1889	
1890	IACHIMO	More particulars
1891	Must justify my knowledge.
1892	
1893	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	So they must,
1894	Or do your honour injury.
1895	
1896	IACHIMO	The chimney
1897	Is south the chamber, and the chimney-piece
1898	Chaste Dian bathing: never saw I figures
1899	So likely to report themselves: the cutter
1900	Was as another nature, dumb; outwent her,
1901	Motion and breath left out.
1902	
1903	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is a thing
1904	Which you might from relation likewise reap,
1905	Being, as it is, much spoke of.
1906	
1907	IACHIMO	The roof o' the chamber
1908	With golden cherubins is fretted: her andirons--
1909	I had forgot them--were two winking Cupids
1910	Of silver, each on one foot standing, nicely
1911	Depending on their brands.
1912	
1913	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	This is her honour!
1914	Let it be granted you have seen all this--and praise
1915	Be given to your remembrance--the description
1916	Of what is in her chamber nothing saves
1917	The wager you have laid.
1918	
1919	IACHIMO	Then, if you can,
1920	
1921	[Showing the bracelet]
1922	
1923	Be pale: I beg but leave to air this jewel; see!
1924	And now 'tis up again: it must be married
1925	To that your diamond; I'll keep them.
1926	
1927	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Jove!
1928	Once more let me behold it: is it that
1929	Which I left with her?
1930	
1931	IACHIMO	Sir--I thank her--that:
1932	She stripp'd it from her arm; I see her yet;
1933	Her pretty action did outsell her gift,
1934	And yet enrich'd it too: she gave it me, and said
1935	She prized it once.
1936	
1937	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	May be she pluck'd it off
1938	To send it me.
1939	
1940	IACHIMO	She writes so to you, doth she?
1941	
1942	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	O, no, no, no! 'tis true. Here, take this too;
1943	
1944	[Gives the ring]
1945	
1946	It is a basilisk unto mine eye,
1947	Kills me to look on't. Let there be no honour
1948	Where there is beauty; truth, where semblance; love,
1949	Where there's another man: the vows of women
1950	Of no more bondage be, to where they are made,
1951	Than they are to their virtues; which is nothing.
1952	O, above measure false!
1953	
1954	PHILARIO	Have patience, sir,
1955	And take your ring again; 'tis not yet won:
1956	It may be probable she lost it; or
1957	Who knows if one of her women, being corrupted,
1958	Hath stol'n it from her?
1959	
1960	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Very true;
1961	And so, I hope, he came by't. Back my ring:
1962	Render to me some corporal sign about her,
1963	More evident than this; for this was stolen.
1964	
1965	IACHIMO	By Jupiter, I had it from her arm.
1966	
1967	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Hark you, he swears; by Jupiter he swears.
1968	'Tis true:--nay, keep the ring--'tis true: I am sure
1969	She would not lose it: her attendants are
1970	All sworn and honourable:--they induced to steal it!
1971	And by a stranger!--No, he hath enjoyed her:
1972	The cognizance of her incontinency
1973	Is this: she hath bought the name of whore
1974	thus dearly.
1975	There, take thy hire; and all the fiends of hell
1976	Divide themselves between you!
1977	
1978	PHILARIO	Sir, be patient:
1979	This is not strong enough to be believed
1980	Of one persuaded well of--
1981	
1982	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Never talk on't;
1983	She hath been colted by him.
1984	
1985	IACHIMO	If you seek
1986	For further satisfying, under her breast--
1987	Worthy the pressing--lies a mole, right proud
1988	Of that most delicate lodging: by my life,
1989	I kiss'd it; and it gave me present hunger
1990	To feed again, though full. You do remember
1991	This stain upon her?
1992	
1993	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Ay, and it doth confirm
1994	Another stain, as big as hell can hold,
1995	Were there no more but it.
1996	
1997	IACHIMO	Will you hear more?
1998	
1999	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Spare your arithmetic: never count the turns;
2000	Once, and a million!
2001	
2002	IACHIMO	I'll be sworn--
2003	
2004	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No swearing.
2005	If you will swear you have not done't, you lie;
2006	And I will kill thee, if thou dost deny
2007	Thou'st made me cuckold.
2008	
2009	IACHIMO	I'll deny nothing.
2010	
2011	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	O, that I had her here, to tear her limb-meal!
2012	I will go there and do't, i' the court, before
2013	Her father. I'll do something--
2014	
2015	[Exit]
2016	
2017	PHILARIO	Quite besides
2018	The government of patience! You have won:
2019	Let's follow him, and pervert the present wrath
2020	He hath against himself.
2021	
2022	IACHIMO	With an my heart.

2037	
2038	
2039	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS]
2040	
2041	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Is there no way for men to be but women
2042	Must be half-workers? We are all bastards;
2043	And that most venerable man which I
2044	Did call my father, was I know not where
2045	When I was stamp'd; some coiner with his tools
2046	Made me a counterfeit: yet my mother seem'd
2047	The Dian of that time so doth my wife
2048	The nonpareil of this. O, vengeance, vengeance!
2049	Me of my lawful pleasure she restrain'd
2050	And pray'd me oft forbearance; did it with
2051	A pudency so rosy the sweet view on't
2052	Might well have warm'd old Saturn; that I thought her
2053	As chaste as unsunn'd snow. O, all the devils!
2054	This yellow Iachimo, in an hour,--wast not?--
2055	Or less,--at first?--perchance he spoke not, but,
2056	Like a full-acorn'd boar, a German one,
2057	Cried 'O!' and mounted; found no opposition
2058	But what he look'd for should oppose and she
2059	Should from encounter guard. Could I find out
2060	The woman's part in me! For there's no motion
2061	That tends to vice in man, but I affirm
2062	It is the woman's part: be it lying, note it,
2063	The woman's; flattering, hers; deceiving, hers;
2064	Lust and rank thoughts, hers, hers; revenges, hers;
2065	Ambitions, covetings, change of prides, disdain,
2066	Nice longing, slanders, mutability,
2067	All faults that may be named, nay, that hell knows,
2068	Why, hers, in part or all; but rather, all;
2069	For even to vice
2070	They are not constant but are changing still
2071	One vice, but of a minute old, for one
2072	Not half so old as that. I'll write against them,
2073	Detest them, curse them: yet 'tis greater skill
2074	In a true hate, to pray they have their will:
2075	The very devils cannot plague them better.

2085	ACT III
2086	
2087	
2088	
2089	SCENE I	Britain. A hall in Cymbeline's palace.
2090	
2091	
2092	[Enter in state, CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN,
2093	and Lords at one door, and at another,
2094	CAIUS LUCIUS and Attendants]
2095	
2096	CYMBELINE	Now say, what would Augustus Caesar with us?
2097	
2098	CAIUS LUCIUS	When Julius Caesar, whose remembrance yet
2099	Lives in men's eyes and will to ears and tongues
2100	Be theme and hearing ever, was in this Britain
2101	And conquer'd it, Cassibelan, thine uncle,--
2102	Famous in Caesar's praises, no whit less
2103	Than in his feats deserving it--for him
2104	And his succession granted Rome a tribute,
2105	Yearly three thousand pounds, which by thee lately
2106	Is left untender'd.
2107	
2108	QUEEN	And, to kill the marvel,
2109	Shall be so ever.
2110	
2111	CLOTEN	There be many Caesars,
2112	Ere such another Julius. Britain is
2113	A world by itself; and we will nothing pay
2114	For wearing our own noses.
2115	
2116	QUEEN	That opportunity
2117	Which then they had to take from 's, to resume
2118	We have again. Remember, sir, my liege,
2119	The kings your ancestors, together with
2120	The natural bravery of your isle, which stands
2121	As Neptune's park, ribbed and paled in
2122	With rocks unscalable and roaring waters,
2123	With sands that will not bear your enemies' boats,
2124	But suck them up to the topmast. A kind of conquest
2125	Caesar made here; but made not here his brag
2126	Of 'Came' and 'saw' and 'overcame: ' with shame--
2127	That first that ever touch'd him--he was carried
2128	From off our coast, twice beaten; and his shipping--
2129	Poor ignorant baubles!-- upon our terrible seas,
2130	Like egg-shells moved upon their surges, crack'd
2131	As easily 'gainst our rocks: for joy whereof
2132	The famed Cassibelan, who was once at point--
2133	O giglot fortune!--to master Caesar's sword,
2134	Made Lud's town with rejoicing fires bright
2135	And Britons strut with courage.
2136	
2137	CLOTEN	Come, there's no more tribute to be paid: our
2138	kingdom is stronger than it was at that time; and,
2139	as I said, there is no moe such Caesars: other of
2140	them may have crook'd noses, but to owe such
2141	straight arms, none.
2142	
2143	CYMBELINE	Son, let your mother end.
2144	
2145	CLOTEN	We have yet many among us can gripe as hard as
2146	Cassibelan: I do not say I am one; but I have a
2147	hand. Why tribute? why should we pay tribute? If
2148	Caesar can hide the sun from us with a blanket, or
2149	put the moon in his pocket, we will pay him tribute
2150	for light; else, sir, no more tribute, pray you now.
2151	
2152	CYMBELINE	You must know,
2153	Till the injurious Romans did extort
2154	This tribute from us, we were free:
2155	Caesar's ambition,
2156	Which swell'd so much that it did almost stretch
2157	The sides o' the world, against all colour here
2158	Did put the yoke upon 's; which to shake off
2159	Becomes a warlike people, whom we reckon
2160	Ourselves to be.
2161	
2162	CLOTEN	|
2163	|                We do.
2164	Lords	|
2165	
2166	CYMBELINE	Say, then, to Caesar,
2167	Our ancestor was that Mulmutius which
2168	Ordain'd our laws, whose use the sword of Caesar
2169	Hath too much mangled; whose repair and franchise
2170	Shall, by the power we hold, be our good deed,
2171	Though Rome be therefore angry: Mulmutius made our laws,
2172	Who was the first of Britain which did put
2173	His brows within a golden crown and call'd
2174	Himself a king.
2175	
2176	CAIUS LUCIUS	                  I am sorry, Cymbeline,
2177	That I am to pronounce Augustus Caesar--
2178	Caesar, that hath more kings his servants than
2179	Thyself domestic officers--thine enemy:
2180	Receive it from me, then: war and confusion
2181	In Caesar's name pronounce I 'gainst thee: look
2182	For fury not to be resisted. Thus defied,
2183	I thank thee for myself.
2184	
2185	CYMBELINE	Thou art welcome, Caius.
2186	Thy Caesar knighted me; my youth I spent
2187	Much under him; of him I gather'd honour;
2188	Which he to seek of me again, perforce,
2189	Behoves me keep at utterance. I am perfect
2190	That the Pannonians and Dalmatians for
2191	Their liberties are now in arms; a precedent
2192	Which not to read would show the Britons cold:
2193	So Caesar shall not find them.

2195	CAIUS LUCIUS	Let proof speak.
2196	
2197	CLOTEN	His majesty bids you welcome. Make
2198	pastime with us a day or two, or longer: if
2199	you seek us afterwards in other terms, you
2200	shall find us in our salt-water girdle: if you
2201	beat us out of it, it is yours; if you fall in
2202	the adventure, our crows shall fare the better
2203	for you; and there's an end.
2204	
2205	CAIUS LUCIUS	So, sir.
2206	
2207	CYMBELINE	I know your master's pleasure and he mine:
2208	All the remain is 'Welcome!'

2223	
2224	
2225	[Enter PISANIO, with a letter]
2226	
2227	PISANIO	How? of adultery? Wherefore write you not
2228	What monster's her accuser? Leonatus,
2229	O master! what a strange infection
2230	Is fall'n into thy ear! What false Italian,
2231	As poisonous-tongued as handed, hath prevail'd
2232	On thy too ready hearing? Disloyal! No:
2233	She's punish'd for her truth, and undergoes,
2234	More goddess-like than wife-like, such assaults
2235	As would take in some virtue. O my master!
2236	Thy mind to her is now as low as were
2237	Thy fortunes. How! that I should murder her?
2238	Upon the love and truth and vows which I
2239	Have made to thy command? I, her? her blood?
2240	If it be so to do good service, never
2241	Let me be counted serviceable. How look I,
2242	That I should seem to lack humanity
2243	so much as this fact comes to?
2244	
2245	[Reading]
2246	
2247	'Do't: the letter
2248	that I have sent her, by her own command
2249	Shall give thee opportunity.' O damn'd paper!
2250	Black as the ink that's on thee! Senseless bauble,
2251	Art thou a feodary for this act, and look'st
2252	So virgin-like without? Lo, here she comes.
2253	I am ignorant in what I am commanded.
2254	
2255	[Enter IMOGEN]
2256	
2257	IMOGEN	How now, Pisanio!
2258	
2259	PISANIO	Madam, here is a letter from my lord.
2260	
2261	IMOGEN	Who? thy lord? that is my lord, Leonatus!
2262	O, learn'd indeed were that astronomer
2263	That knew the stars as I his characters;
2264	He'ld lay the future open. You good gods,
2265	Let what is here contain'd relish of love,
2266	Of my lord's health, of his content, yet not
2267	That we two are asunder; let that grieve him:
2268	Some griefs are med'cinable; that is one of them,
2269	For it doth physic love: of his content,
2270	All but in that! Good wax, thy leave. Blest be
2271	You bees that make these locks of counsel! Lovers
2272	And men in dangerous bonds pray not alike:
2273	Though forfeiters you cast in prison, yet
2274	You clasp young Cupid's tables. Good news, gods!
2275	
2276	[Reads]
2277	
2278	'Justice, and your father's wrath, should he take me
2279	in his dominion, could not be so cruel to me, as
2280	you, O the dearest of creatures, would even renew me
2281	with your eyes. Take notice that I am in Cambria,
2282	at Milford-Haven: what your own love will out of
2283	this advise you, follow. So he wishes you all
2284	happiness, that remains loyal to his vow, and your,
2285	increasing in love,
2286	LEONATUS POSTHUMUS.'
2287	O, for a horse with wings! Hear'st thou, Pisanio?
2288	He is at Milford-Haven: read, and tell me
2289	How far 'tis thither. If one of mean affairs
2290	May plod it in a week, why may not I
2291	Glide thither in a day? Then, true Pisanio,--
2292	Who long'st, like me, to see thy lord; who long'st,--
2293	let me bate,-but not like me--yet long'st,
2294	But in a fainter kind:--O, not like me;
2295	For mine's beyond beyond--say, and speak thick;
2296	Love's counsellor should fill the bores of hearing,
2297	To the smothering of the sense--how far it is
2298	To this same blessed Milford: and by the way
2299	Tell me how Wales was made so happy as
2300	To inherit such a haven: but first of all,
2301	How we may steal from hence, and for the gap
2302	That we shall make in time, from our hence-going
2303	And our return, to excuse: but first, how get hence:
2304	Why should excuse be born or e'er begot?
2305	We'll talk of that hereafter. Prithee, speak,
2306	How many score of miles may we well ride
2307	'Twixt hour and hour?
2308	
2309	PISANIO	One score 'twixt sun and sun,
2310	Madam, 's enough for you:
2311	
2312	[Aside]
2313	
2314	and too much too.
2315	
2316	IMOGEN	Why, one that rode to's execution, man,
2317	Could never go so slow: I have heard of
2318	riding wagers,
2319	Where horses have been nimbler than the sands
2320	That run i' the clock's behalf. But this is foolery:
2321	Go bid my woman feign a sickness; say
2322	She'll home to her father: and provide me presently
2323	A riding-suit, no costlier than would fit
2324	A franklin's housewife.
2325	
2326	PISANIO	Madam, you're best consider.
2327	
2328	IMOGEN	I see before me, man: nor here, nor here,
2329	Nor what ensues, but have a fog in them,
2330	That I cannot look through. Away, I prithee;
2331	Do as I bid thee: there's no more to say,
2332	Accessible is none but Milford way.

2342	ACT III
2343	
2344	
2345	
2346	SCENE III	Wales: a mountainous country with a cave.
2347	
2348	
2349	[Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS; GUIDERIUS,
2350	and ARVIRAGUS following]
2351	
2352	BELARIUS	A goodly day not to keep house, with such
2353	Whose roof's as low as ours! Stoop, boys; this gate
2354	Instructs you how to adore the heavens and bows you
2355	To a morning's holy office: the gates of monarchs
2356	Are arch'd so high that giants may jet through
2357	And keep their impious turbans on, without
2358	Good morrow to the sun. Hail, thou fair heaven!
2359	We house i' the rock, yet use thee not so hardly
2360	As prouder livers do.
2361	
2362	GUIDERIUS	Hail, heaven!
2363	
2364	ARVIRAGUS	Hail, heaven!
2365	
2366	BELARIUS	Now for our mountain sport: up to yond hill;
2367	Your legs are young; I'll tread these flats. Consider,
2368	When you above perceive me like a crow,
2369	That it is place which lessens and sets off;
2370	And you may then revolve what tales I have told you
2371	Of courts, of princes, of the tricks in war:
2372	This service is not service, so being done,
2373	But being so allow'd: to apprehend thus,
2374	Draws us a profit from all things we see;
2375	And often, to our comfort, shall we find
2376	The sharded beetle in a safer hold
2377	Than is the full-wing'd eagle. O, this life
2378	Is nobler than attending for a cheque,
2379	Richer than doing nothing for a bauble,
2380	Prouder than rustling in unpaid-for silk:
2381	Such gain the cap of him that makes 'em fine,
2382	Yet keeps his book uncross'd: no life to ours.
2383	
2384	GUIDERIUS	Out of your proof you speak: we, poor unfledged,
2385	Have never wing'd from view o' the nest, nor know not
2386	What air's from home. Haply this life is best,
2387	If quiet life be best; sweeter to you
2388	That have a sharper known; well corresponding
2389	With your stiff age: but unto us it is
2390	A cell of ignorance; travelling a-bed;
2391	A prison for a debtor, that not dares
2392	To stride a limit.
2393	
2394	ARVIRAGUS	                  What should we speak of
2395	When we are old as you? when we shall hear
2396	The rain and wind beat dark December, how,
2397	In this our pinching cave, shall we discourse
2398	The freezing hours away? We have seen nothing;
2399	We are beastly, subtle as the fox for prey,
2400	Like warlike as the wolf for what we eat;
2401	Our valour is to chase what flies; our cage
2402	We make a quire, as doth the prison'd bird,
2403	And sing our bondage freely.
2404	
2405	BELARIUS	How you speak!
2406	Did you but know the city's usuries
2407	And felt them knowingly; the art o' the court
2408	As hard to leave as keep; whose top to climb
2409	Is certain falling, or so slippery that
2410	The fear's as bad as falling; the toil o' the war,
2411	A pain that only seems to seek out danger
2412	I' the name of fame and honour; which dies i'
2413	the search,
2414	And hath as oft a slanderous epitaph
2415	As record of fair act; nay, many times,
2416	Doth ill deserve by doing well; what's worse,
2417	Must court'sy at the censure:--O boys, this story
2418	The world may read in me: my body's mark'd
2419	With Roman swords, and my report was once
2420	First with the best of note: Cymbeline loved me,
2421	And when a soldier was the theme, my name
2422	Was not far off: then was I as a tree
2423	Whose boughs did bend with fruit: but in one night,
2424	A storm or robbery, call it what you will,
2425	Shook down my mellow hangings, nay, my leaves,
2426	And left me bare to weather.
2427	
2428	GUIDERIUS	Uncertain favour!
2429	
2430	BELARIUS	My fault being nothing--as I have told you oft--
2431	But that two villains, whose false oaths prevail'd
2432	Before my perfect honour, swore to Cymbeline
2433	I was confederate with the Romans: so
2434	Follow'd my banishment, and this twenty years
2435	This rock and these demesnes have been my world;
2436	Where I have lived at honest freedom, paid
2437	More pious debts to heaven than in all
2438	The fore-end of my time. But up to the mountains!
2439	This is not hunters' language: he that strikes
2440	The venison first shall be the lord o' the feast;
2441	To him the other two shall minister;
2442	And we will fear no poison, which attends
2443	In place of greater state. I'll meet you in the valleys.
2444	
2445	[Exeunt GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]
2446	
2447	How hard it is to hide the sparks of nature!
2448	These boys know little they are sons to the king;
2449	Nor Cymbeline dreams that they are alive.
2450	They think they are mine; and though train'd
2451	up thus meanly
2452	I' the cave wherein they bow, their thoughts do hit
2453	The roofs of palaces, and nature prompts them
2454	In simple and low things to prince it much
2455	Beyond the trick of others. This Polydore,
2456	The heir of Cymbeline and Britain, who
2457	The king his father call'd Guiderius,--Jove!
2458	When on my three-foot stool I sit and tell
2459	The warlike feats I have done, his spirits fly out
2460	Into my story: say 'Thus, mine enemy fell,
2461	And thus I set my foot on 's neck;' even then
2462	The princely blood flows in his cheek, he sweats,
2463	Strains his young nerves and puts himself in posture
2464	That acts my words. The younger brother, Cadwal,
2465	Once Arviragus, in as like a figure,
2466	Strikes life into my speech and shows much more
2467	His own conceiving.--Hark, the game is roused!
2468	O Cymbeline! heaven and my conscience knows
2469	Thou didst unjustly banish me: whereon,
2470	At three and two years old, I stole these babes;
2471	Thinking to bar thee of succession, as
2472	Thou reft'st me of my lands. Euriphile,
2473	Thou wast their nurse; they took thee for
2474	their mother,
2475	And every day do honour to her grave:
2476	Myself, Belarius, that am Morgan call'd,
2477	They take for natural father. The game is up.

2491	SCENE IV	Country near Milford-Haven.
2492	
2493	
2494	[Enter PISANIO and IMOGEN]
2495	
2496	IMOGEN	Thou told'st me, when we came from horse, the place
2497	Was near at hand: ne'er long'd my mother so
2498	To see me first, as I have now. Pisanio! man!
2499	Where is Posthumus? What is in thy mind,
2500	That makes thee stare thus? Wherefore breaks that sigh
2501	From the inward of thee? One, but painted thus,
2502	Would be interpreted a thing perplex'd
2503	Beyond self-explication: put thyself
2504	Into a havior of less fear, ere wildness
2505	Vanquish my staider senses. What's the matter?
2506	Why tender'st thou that paper to me, with
2507	A look untender? If't be summer news,
2508	Smile to't before; if winterly, thou need'st
2509	But keep that countenance still. My husband's hand!
2510	That drug-damn'd Italy hath out-craftied him,
2511	And he's at some hard point. Speak, man: thy tongue
2512	May take off some extremity, which to read
2513	Would be even mortal to me.
2514	
2515	PISANIO	Please you, read;
2516	And you shall find me, wretched man, a thing
2517	The most disdain'd of fortune.
2518	
2519	IMOGEN	[Reads]  'Thy mistress, Pisanio, hath played the
2520	strumpet in my bed; the testimonies whereof lie
2521	bleeding in me. I speak not out of weak surmises,
2522	but from proof as strong as my grief and as certain
2523	as I expect my revenge. That part thou, Pisanio,
2524	must act for me, if thy faith be not tainted with
2525	the breach of hers. Let thine own hands take away
2526	her life: I shall give thee opportunity at
2527	Milford-Haven. She hath my letter for the purpose
2528	where, if thou fear to strike and to make me certain
2529	it is done, thou art the pandar to her dishonour and
2530	equally to me disloyal.'
2531	
2532	PISANIO	What shall I need to draw my sword? the paper
2533	Hath cut her throat already. No, 'tis slander,
2534	Whose edge is sharper than the sword, whose tongue
2535	Outvenoms all the worms of Nile, whose breath
2536	Rides on the posting winds and doth belie
2537	All corners of the world: kings, queens and states,
2538	Maids, matrons, nay, the secrets of the grave
2539	This viperous slander enters. What cheer, madam?
2540	
2541	IMOGEN	False to his bed! What is it to be false?
2542	To lie in watch there and to think on him?
2543	To weep 'twixt clock and clock? if sleep
2544	charge nature,
2545	To break it with a fearful dream of him
2546	And cry myself awake? that's false to's bed, is it?
2547	
2548	PISANIO	Alas, good lady!
2549	
2550	IMOGEN	I false! Thy conscience witness: Iachimo,
2551	Thou didst accuse him of incontinency;
2552	Thou then look'dst like a villain; now methinks
2553	Thy favour's good enough. Some jay of Italy
2554	Whose mother was her painting, hath betray'd him:
2555	Poor I am stale, a garment out of fashion;
2556	And, for I am richer than to hang by the walls,
2557	I must be ripp'd:--to pieces with me!--O,
2558	Men's vows are women's traitors! All good seeming,
2559	By thy revolt, O husband, shall be thought
2560	Put on for villany; not born where't grows,
2561	But worn a bait for ladies.
2562	
2563	PISANIO	Good madam, hear me.
2564	
2565	IMOGEN	True honest men being heard, like false Aeneas,
2566	Were in his time thought false, and Sinon's weeping
2567	Did scandal many a holy tear, took pity
2568	From most true wretchedness: so thou, Posthumus,
2569	Wilt lay the leaven on all proper men;
2570	Goodly and gallant shall be false and perjured
2571	From thy great fall. Come, fellow, be thou honest:
2572	Do thou thy master's bidding: when thou see'st him,
2573	A little witness my obedience: look!
2574	I draw the sword myself: take it, and hit
2575	The innocent mansion of my love, my heart;
2576	Fear not; 'tis empty of all things but grief;
2577	Thy master is not there, who was indeed
2578	The riches of it: do his bidding; strike
2579	Thou mayst be valiant in a better cause;
2580	But now thou seem'st a coward.
2581	
2582	PISANIO	Hence, vile instrument!
2583	Thou shalt not damn my hand.
2584	
2585	IMOGEN	Why, I must die;
2586	And if I do not by thy hand, thou art
2587	No servant of thy master's. Against self-slaughter
2588	There is a prohibition so divine
2589	That cravens my weak hand. Come, here's my heart.
2590	Something's afore't. Soft, soft! we'll no defence;
2591	Obedient as the scabbard. What is here?
2592	The scriptures of the loyal Leonatus,
2593	All turn'd to heresy? Away, away,
2594	Corrupters of my faith! you shall no more
2595	Be stomachers to my heart. Thus may poor fools
2596	Believe false teachers: though those that
2597	are betray'd
2598	Do feel the treason sharply, yet the traitor
2599	Stands in worse case of woe.
2600	And thou, Posthumus, thou that didst set up
2601	My disobedience 'gainst the king my father
2602	And make me put into contempt the suits
2603	Of princely fellows, shalt hereafter find
2604	It is no act of common passage, but
2605	A strain of rareness: and I grieve myself
2606	To think, when thou shalt be disedged by her
2607	That now thou tirest on, how thy memory
2608	Will then be pang'd by me. Prithee, dispatch:
2609	The lamb entreats the butcher: where's thy knife?
2610	Thou art too slow to do thy master's bidding,
2611	When I desire it too.
2612	
2613	PISANIO	O gracious lady,
2614	Since I received command to do this business
2615	I have not slept one wink.
2616	
2617	IMOGEN	Do't, and to bed then.
2618	
2619	PISANIO	I'll wake mine eye-balls blind first.
2620	
2621	IMOGEN	Wherefore then
2622	Didst undertake it? Why hast thou abused
2623	So many miles with a pretence? this place?
2624	Mine action and thine own? our horses' labour?
2625	The time inviting thee? the perturb'd court,
2626	For my being absent? whereunto I never
2627	Purpose return. Why hast thou gone so far,
2628	To be unbent when thou hast ta'en thy stand,
2629	The elected deer before thee?
2630	
2631	PISANIO	But to win time
2632	To lose so bad employment; in the which
2633	I have consider'd of a course. Good lady,
2634	Hear me with patience.
2635	
2636	IMOGEN	Talk thy tongue weary; speak
2637	I have heard I am a strumpet; and mine ear
2638	Therein false struck, can take no greater wound,
2639	Nor tent to bottom that. But speak.
2640	
2641	PISANIO	Then, madam,
2642	I thought you would not back again.
2643	
2644	IMOGEN	Most like;
2645	Bringing me here to kill me.
2646	
2647	PISANIO	Not so, neither:
2648	But if I were as wise as honest, then
2649	My purpose would prove well. It cannot be
2650	But that my master is abused:
2651	Some villain, ay, and singular in his art.
2652	Hath done you both this cursed injury.
2653	
2654	IMOGEN	Some Roman courtezan.
2655	
2656	PISANIO	No, on my life.
2657	I'll give but notice you are dead and send him
2658	Some bloody sign of it; for 'tis commanded
2659	I should do so: you shall be miss'd at court,
2660	And that will well confirm it.
2661	
2662	IMOGEN	Why good fellow,
2663	What shall I do the where? where bide? how live?
2664	Or in my life what comfort, when I am
2665	Dead to my husband?
2666	
2667	PISANIO	If you'll back to the court--
2668	
2669	IMOGEN	No court, no father; nor no more ado
2670	With that harsh, noble, simple nothing,
2671	That Cloten, whose love-suit hath been to me
2672	As fearful as a siege.
2673	
2674	PISANIO	If not at court,
2675	Then not in Britain must you bide.
2676	
2677	IMOGEN	Where then
2678	Hath Britain all the sun that shines? Day, night,
2679	Are they not but in Britain? I' the world's volume
2680	Our Britain seems as of it, but not in 't;
2681	In a great pool a swan's nest: prithee, think
2682	There's livers out of Britain.
2683	
2684	PISANIO	I am most glad
2685	You think of other place. The ambassador,
2686	Lucius the Roman, comes to Milford-Haven
2687	To-morrow: now, if you could wear a mind
2688	Dark as your fortune is, and but disguise
2689	That which, to appear itself, must not yet be
2690	But by self-danger, you should tread a course
2691	Pretty and full of view; yea, haply, near
2692	The residence of Posthumus; so nigh at least
2693	That though his actions were not visible, yet
2694	Report should render him hourly to your ear
2695	As truly as he moves.
2696	
2697	IMOGEN	O, for such means!
2698	Though peril to my modesty, not death on't,
2699	I would adventure.
2700	
2701	PISANIO	Well, then, here's the point:
2702	You must forget to be a woman; change
2703	Command into obedience: fear and niceness--
2704	The handmaids of all women, or, more truly,
2705	Woman its pretty self--into a waggish courage:
2706	Ready in gibes, quick-answer'd, saucy and
2707	As quarrelous as the weasel; nay, you must
2708	Forget that rarest treasure of your cheek,
2709	Exposing it--but, O, the harder heart!
2710	Alack, no remedy!--to the greedy touch
2711	Of common-kissing Titan, and forget
2712	Your laboursome and dainty trims, wherein
2713	You made great Juno angry.
2714	
2715	IMOGEN	Nay, be brief
2716	I see into thy end, and am almost
2717	A man already.
2718	
2719	PISANIO	First, make yourself but like one.
2720	Fore-thinking this, I have already fit--
2721	'Tis in my cloak-bag--doublet, hat, hose, all
2722	That answer to them: would you in their serving,
2723	And with what imitation you can borrow
2724	From youth of such a season, 'fore noble Lucius
2725	Present yourself, desire his service, tell him
2726	wherein you're happy,--which you'll make him know,
2727	If that his head have ear in music,--doubtless
2728	With joy he will embrace you, for he's honourable
2729	And doubling that, most holy. Your means abroad,
2730	You have me, rich; and I will never fail
2731	Beginning nor supplyment.
2732	
2733	IMOGEN	Thou art all the comfort
2734	The gods will diet me with. Prithee, away:
2735	There's more to be consider'd; but we'll even
2736	All that good time will give us: this attempt
2737	I am soldier to, and will abide it with
2738	A prince's courage. Away, I prithee.
2739	
2740	PISANIO	Well, madam, we must take a short farewell,
2741	Lest, being miss'd, I be suspected of
2742	Your carriage from the court. My noble mistress,
2743	Here is a box; I had it from the queen:
2744	What's in't is precious; if you are sick at sea,
2745	Or stomach-qualm'd at land, a dram of this
2746	Will drive away distemper. To some shade,
2747	And fit you to your manhood. May the gods
2748	Direct you to the best!
2749	
2750	IMOGEN	Amen: I thank thee.
2751	
2752	[Exeunt, severally]

2759	
2760	ACT III
2761	
2762	
2763	
2764	SCENE V	A room in Cymbeline's palace.
2765	
2766	
2767	[Enter CYMBELINE, QUEEN, CLOTEN, LUCIUS,
2768	Lords, and Attendants]
2769	
2770	CYMBELINE	Thus far; and so farewell.
2771	
2772	CAIUS LUCIUS	Thanks, royal sir.
2773	My emperor hath wrote, I must from hence;
2774	And am right sorry that I must report ye
2775	My master's enemy.
2776	
2777	CYMBELINE	                  Our subjects, sir,
2778	Will not endure his yoke; and for ourself
2779	To show less sovereignty than they, must needs
2780	Appear unkinglike.
2781	
2782	CAIUS LUCIUS	                  So, sir: I desire of you
2783	A conduct over-land to Milford-Haven.
2784	Madam, all joy befal your grace!
2785	
2786	QUEEN	And you!
2787	
2788	CYMBELINE	My lords, you are appointed for that office;
2789	The due of honour in no point omit.
2790	So farewell, noble Lucius.
2791	
2792	CAIUS LUCIUS	Your hand, my lord.
2793	
2794	CLOTEN	Receive it friendly; but from this time forth
2795	I wear it as your enemy.
2796	
2797	CAIUS LUCIUS	Sir, the event
2798	Is yet to name the winner: fare you well.
2799	
2800	CYMBELINE	Leave not the worthy Lucius, good my lords,
2801	Till he have cross'd the Severn. Happiness!
2802	
2803	[Exeunt LUCIUS and Lords]
2804	
2805	QUEEN	He goes hence frowning: but it honours us
2806	That we have given him cause.
2807	
2808	CLOTEN	'Tis all the better;
2809	Your valiant Britons have their wishes in it.
2810	
2811	CYMBELINE	Lucius hath wrote already to the emperor
2812	How it goes here. It fits us therefore ripely
2813	Our chariots and our horsemen be in readiness:
2814	The powers that he already hath in Gallia
2815	Will soon be drawn to head, from whence he moves
2816	His war for Britain.
2817	
2818	QUEEN	'Tis not sleepy business;
2819	But must be look'd to speedily and strongly.
2820	
2821	CYMBELINE	Our expectation that it would be thus
2822	Hath made us forward. But, my gentle queen,
2823	Where is our daughter? She hath not appear'd
2824	Before the Roman, nor to us hath tender'd
2825	The duty of the day: she looks us like
2826	A thing more made of malice than of duty:
2827	We have noted it. Call her before us; for
2828	We have been too slight in sufferance.
2829	
2830	[Exit an Attendant]
2831	
2832	QUEEN	Royal sir,
2833	Since the exile of Posthumus, most retired
2834	Hath her life been; the cure whereof, my lord,
2835	'Tis time must do. Beseech your majesty,
2836	Forbear sharp speeches to her: she's a lady
2837	So tender of rebukes that words are strokes
2838	And strokes death to her.
2839	
2840	[Re-enter Attendant]
2841	
2842	CYMBELINE	Where is she, sir? How
2843	Can her contempt be answer'd?
2844	
2845	Attendant	Please you, sir,
2846	Her chambers are all lock'd; and there's no answer
2847	That will be given to the loudest noise we make.
2848	
2849	QUEEN	My lord, when last I went to visit her,
2850	She pray'd me to excuse her keeping close,
2851	Whereto constrain'd by her infirmity,
2852	She should that duty leave unpaid to you,
2853	Which daily she was bound to proffer: this
2854	She wish'd me to make known; but our great court
2855	Made me to blame in memory.
2856	
2857	CYMBELINE	Her doors lock'd?
2858	Not seen of late? Grant, heavens, that which I fear
2859	Prove false!
2860	
2861	[Exit]
2862	
2863	QUEEN	Son, I say, follow the king.
2864	
2865	CLOTEN	That man of hers, Pisanio, her old servant,
2866	have not seen these two days.
2867	
2868	QUEEN	Go, look after.
2869	
2870	[Exit CLOTEN]
2871	
2872	Pisanio, thou that stand'st so for Posthumus!
2873	He hath a drug of mine; I pray his absence
2874	Proceed by swallowing that, for he believes
2875	It is a thing most precious. But for her,
2876	Where is she gone? Haply, despair hath seized her,
2877	Or, wing'd with fervor of her love, she's flown
2878	To her desired Posthumus: gone she is
2879	To death or to dishonour; and my end
2880	Can make good use of either: she being down,
2881	I have the placing of the British crown.
2882	
2883	[Re-enter CLOTEN]
2884	
2885	How now, my son!
2886	
2887	CLOTEN	'Tis certain she is fled.
2888	Go in and cheer the king: he rages; none
2889	Dare come about him.
2890	
2891	QUEEN	[Aside]            All the better: may
2892	This night forestall him of the coming day!
2893	
2894	[Exit]
2895	
2896	CLOTEN	I love and hate her: for she's fair and royal,
2897	And that she hath all courtly parts more exquisite
2898	Than lady, ladies, woman; from every one
2899	The best she hath, and she, of all compounded,
2900	Outsells them all; I love her therefore: but
2901	Disdaining me and throwing favours on
2902	The low Posthumus slanders so her judgment
2903	That what's else rare is choked; and in that point
2904	I will conclude to hate her, nay, indeed,
2905	To be revenged upon her. For when fools Shall--
2906	
2907	[Enter PISANIO]
2908	
2909	Who is here? What, are you packing, sirrah?
2910	Come hither: ah, you precious pander! Villain,
2911	Where is thy lady? In a word; or else
2912	Thou art straightway with the fiends.
2913	
2914	PISANIO	O, good my lord!
2915	
2916	CLOTEN	Where is thy lady? Or, by Jupiter,--
2917	I will not ask again. Close villain,
2918	I'll have this secret from thy heart, or rip
2919	Thy heart to find it. Is she with Posthumus?
2920	From whose so many weights of baseness cannot
2921	A dram of worth be drawn.
2922	
2923	PISANIO	Alas, my lord,
2924	How can she be with him? When was she missed?
2925	He is in Rome.
2926	
2927	CLOTEN	                  Where is she, sir? Come nearer;
2928	No further halting: satisfy me home
2929	What is become of her.
2930	
2931	PISANIO	O, my all-worthy lord!
2932	
2933	CLOTEN	All-worthy villain!
2934	Discover where thy mistress is at once,
2935	At the next word: no more of 'worthy lord!'
2936	Speak, or thy silence on the instant is
2937	Thy condemnation and thy death.
2938	
2939	PISANIO	Then, sir,
2940	This paper is the history of my knowledge
2941	Touching her flight.
2942	
2943	[Presenting a letter]
2944	
2945	CLOTEN	Let's see't. I will pursue her
2946	Even to Augustus' throne.
2947	
2948	PISANIO	[Aside]                 Or this, or perish.
2949	She's far enough; and what he learns by this
2950	May prove his travel, not her danger.
2951	
2952	CLOTEN	Hum!
2953	
2954	PISANIO	[Aside]  I'll write to my lord she's dead. O Imogen,
2955	Safe mayst thou wander, safe return again!
2956	
2957	CLOTEN	Sirrah, is this letter true?
2958	
2959	PISANIO	Sir, as I think.
2960	
2961	CLOTEN	It is Posthumus' hand; I know't. Sirrah, if thou
2962	wouldst not be a villain, but do me true service,
2963	undergo those employments wherein I should have
2964	cause to use thee with a serious industry, that is,
2965	what villany soe'er I bid thee do, to perform it
2966	directly and truly, I would think thee an honest
2967	man: thou shouldst neither want my means for thy
2968	relief nor my voice for thy preferment.
2969	
2970	PISANIO	Well, my good lord.
2971	
2972	CLOTEN	Wilt thou serve me? for since patiently and
2973	constantly thou hast stuck to the bare fortune of
2974	that beggar Posthumus, thou canst not, in the
2975	course of gratitude, but be a diligent follower of
2976	mine: wilt thou serve me?
2977	
2978	PISANIO	Sir, I will.
2979	
2980	CLOTEN	Give me thy hand; here's my purse. Hast any of thy
2981	late master's garments in thy possession?
2982	
2983	PISANIO	I have, my lord, at my lodging, the same suit he
2984	wore when he took leave of my lady and mistress.
2985	
2986	CLOTEN	The first service thou dost me, fetch that suit
2987	hither: let it be thy lint service; go.
2988	
2989	PISANIO	I shall, my lord.
2990	
2991	[Exit]
2992	
2993	CLOTEN	Meet thee at Milford-Haven!--I forgot to ask him one
2994	thing; I'll remember't anon:--even there, thou
2995	villain Posthumus, will I kill thee. I would these
2996	garments were come. She said upon a time--the
2997	bitterness of it I now belch from my heart--that she
2998	held the very garment of Posthumus in more respect
2999	than my noble and natural person together with the
3000	adornment of my qualities. With that suit upon my
3001	back, will I ravish her: first kill him, and in her
3002	eyes; there shall she see my valour, which will then
3003	be a torment to her contempt. He on the ground, my
3004	speech of insultment ended on his dead body, and
3005	when my lust hath dined,--which, as I say, to vex
3006	her I will execute in the clothes that she so
3007	praised,--to the court I'll knock her back, foot
3008	her home again. She hath despised me rejoicingly,
3009	and I'll be merry in my revenge.
3010	
3011	[Re-enter PISANIO, with the clothes]
3012	
3013	Be those the garments?
3014	
3015	PISANIO	Ay, my noble lord.
3016	
3017	CLOTEN	How long is't since she went to Milford-Haven?
3018	
3019	PISANIO	She can scarce be there yet.
3020	
3021	CLOTEN	Bring this apparel to my chamber; that is the second
3022	thing that I have commanded thee: the third is,
3023	that thou wilt be a voluntary mute to my design. Be
3024	but duteous, and true preferment shall tender itself
3025	to thee. My revenge is now at Milford: would I had
3026	wings to follow it! Come, and be true.
3027	
3028	[Exit]
3029	
3030	PISANIO	Thou bid'st me to my loss: for true to thee
3031	Were to prove false, which I will never be,
3032	To him that is most true. To Milford go,
3033	And find not her whom thou pursuest. Flow, flow,
3034	You heavenly blessings, on her! This fool's speed
3035	Be cross'd with slowness; labour be his meed!
3036	
3037	[Exit]

3043	
3044	
3045	ACT III
3046	
3047	
3048	
3049	SCENE VI	Wales. Before the cave of Belarius.
3050	
3051	
3052	[Enter IMOGEN, in boy's clothes]
3053	
3054	IMOGEN	I see a man's life is a tedious one:
3055	I have tired myself, and for two nights together
3056	Have made the ground my bed. I should be sick,
3057	But that my resolution helps me. Milford,
3058	When from the mountain-top Pisanio show'd thee,
3059	Thou wast within a ken: O Jove! I think
3060	Foundations fly the wretched; such, I mean,
3061	Where they should be relieved. Two beggars told me
3062	I could not miss my way: will poor folks lie,
3063	That have afflictions on them, knowing 'tis
3064	A punishment or trial? Yes; no wonder,
3065	When rich ones scarce tell true. To lapse in fulness
3066	Is sorer than to lie for need, and falsehood
3067	Is worse in kings than beggars. My dear lord!
3068	Thou art one o' the false ones. Now I think on thee,
3069	My hunger's gone; but even before, I was
3070	At point to sink for food. But what is this?
3071	Here is a path to't: 'tis some savage hold:
3072	I were best not to call; I dare not call:
3073	yet famine,
3074	Ere clean it o'erthrow nature, makes it valiant,
3075	Plenty and peace breeds cowards: hardness ever
3076	Of hardiness is mother. Ho! who's here?
3077	If any thing that's civil, speak; if savage,
3078	Take or lend. Ho! No answer? Then I'll enter.
3079	Best draw my sword: and if mine enemy
3080	But fear the sword like me, he'll scarcely look on't.
3081	Such a foe, good heavens!
3082	
3083	[Exit, to the cave]
3084	
3085	[Enter BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]
3086	
3087	BELARIUS	You, Polydote, have proved best woodman and
3088	Are master of the feast: Cadwal and I
3089	Will play the cook and servant; 'tis our match:
3090	The sweat of industry would dry and die,
3091	But for the end it works to. Come; our stomachs
3092	Will make what's homely savoury: weariness
3093	Can snore upon the flint, when resty sloth
3094	Finds the down pillow hard. Now peace be here,
3095	Poor house, that keep'st thyself!
3096	
3097	GUIDERIUS	I am thoroughly weary.
3098	
3099	ARVIRAGUS	I am weak with toil, yet strong in appetite.
3100	
3101	GUIDERIUS	There is cold meat i' the cave; we'll browse on that,
3102	Whilst what we have kill'd be cook'd.
3103	
3104	BELARIUS	[Looking into the cave]
3105	
3106	Stay; come not in.
3107	But that it eats our victuals, I should think
3108	Here were a fairy.
3109	
3110	GUIDERIUS	What's the matter, sir?
3111	
3112	BELARIUS	By Jupiter, an angel! or, if not,
3113	An earthly paragon! Behold divineness
3114	No elder than a boy!
3115	
3116	[Re-enter IMOGEN]
3117	
3118	IMOGEN	Good masters, harm me not:
3119	Before I enter'd here, I call'd; and thought
3120	To have begg'd or bought what I have took:
3121	good troth,
3122	I have stol'n nought, nor would not, though I had found
3123	Gold strew'd i' the floor. Here's money for my meat:
3124	I would have left it on the board so soon
3125	As I had made my meal, and parted
3126	With prayers for the provider.
3127	
3128	GUIDERIUS	Money, youth?
3129	
3130	ARVIRAGUS	All gold and silver rather turn to dirt!
3131	As 'tis no better reckon'd, but of those
3132	Who worship dirty gods.
3133	
3134	IMOGEN	I see you're angry:
3135	Know, if you kill me for my fault, I should
3136	Have died had I not made it.
3137	
3138	BELARIUS	Whither bound?
3139	
3140	IMOGEN	To Milford-Haven.
3141	
3142	BELARIUS	What's your name?
3143	
3144	IMOGEN	Fidele, sir. I have a kinsman who
3145	Is bound for Italy; he embark'd at Milford;
3146	To whom being going, almost spent with hunger,
3147	I am fall'n in this offence.
3148	
3149	BELARIUS	Prithee, fair youth,
3150	Think us no churls, nor measure our good minds
3151	By this rude place we live in. Well encounter'd!
3152	'Tis almost night: you shall have better cheer
3153	Ere you depart: and thanks to stay and eat it.
3154	Boys, bid him welcome.
3155	
3156	GUIDERIUS	Were you a woman, youth,
3157	I should woo hard but be your groom. In honesty,
3158	I bid for you as I'd buy.
3159	
3160	ARVIRAGUS	I'll make't my comfort
3161	He is a man; I'll love him as my brother:
3162	And such a welcome as I'd give to him
3163	After long absence, such is yours: most welcome!
3164	Be sprightly, for you fall 'mongst friends.
3165	
3166	IMOGEN	'Mongst friends,
3167	If brothers.
3168	
3169	[Aside]
3170	
3171	Would it had been so, that they
3172	Had been my father's sons! then had my prize
3173	Been less, and so more equal ballasting
3174	To thee, Posthumus.
3175	
3176	BELARIUS	He wrings at some distress.
3177	
3178	GUIDERIUS	Would I could free't!
3179	
3180	ARVIRAGUS	Or I, whate'er it be,
3181	What pain it cost, what danger. God's!
3182	
3183	BELARIUS	Hark, boys.
3184	
3185	[Whispering]
3186	
3187	IMOGEN	Great men,
3188	That had a court no bigger than this cave,
3189	That did attend themselves and had the virtue
3190	Which their own conscience seal'd them--laying by
3191	That nothing-gift of differing multitudes--
3192	Could not out-peer these twain. Pardon me, gods!
3193	I'd change my sex to be companion with them,
3194	Since Leonatus's false.
3195	
3196	BELARIUS	It shall be so.
3197	Boys, we'll go dress our hunt. Fair youth, come in:
3198	Discourse is heavy, fasting; when we have supp'd,
3199	We'll mannerly demand thee of thy story,
3200	So far as thou wilt speak it.
3201	
3202	GUIDERIUS	Pray, draw near.

3224	
3225	
3226	[Enter two Senators and Tribunes]
3227	
3228	First Senator	This is the tenor of the emperor's writ:
3229	That since the common men are now in action
3230	'Gainst the Pannonians and Dalmatians,
3231	And that the legions now in Gallia are
3232	Full weak to undertake our wars against
3233	The fall'n-off Britons, that we do incite
3234	The gentry to this business. He creates
3235	Lucius preconsul: and to you the tribunes,
3236	For this immediate levy, he commends
3237	His absolute commission. Long live Caesar!
3238	
3239	First Tribune	Is Lucius general of the forces?
3240	
3241	Second Senator	Ay.
3242	
3243	First Tribune	Remaining now in Gallia?
3244	
3245	First Senator	With those legions
3246	Which I have spoke of, whereunto your levy
3247	Must be supplyant: the words of your commission
3248	Will tie you to the numbers and the time
3249	Of their dispatch.
3250	
3251	First Tribune	                  We will discharge our duty.

3266	
3267	
3268	[Enter CLOTEN]
3269	
3270	CLOTEN	I am near to the place where they should meet, if
3271	Pisanio have mapped it truly. How fit his garments
3272	serve me! Why should his mistress, who was made by
3273	him that made the tailor, not be fit too? the
3274	rather--saving reverence of the word--for 'tis said
3275	a woman's fitness comes by fits. Therein I must
3276	play the workman. I dare speak it to myself--for it
3277	is not vain-glory for a man and his glass to confer
3278	in his own chamber--I mean, the lines of my body are
3279	as well drawn as his; no less young, more strong,
3280	not beneath him in fortunes, beyond him in the
3281	advantage of the time, above him in birth, alike
3282	conversant in general services, and more remarkable
3283	in single oppositions: yet this imperceiverant
3284	thing loves him in my despite. What mortality is!
3285	Posthumus, thy head, which now is growing upon thy
3286	shoulders, shall within this hour be off; thy
3287	mistress enforced; thy garments cut to pieces before
3288	thy face: and all this done, spurn her home to her
3289	father; who may haply be a little angry for my so
3290	rough usage; but my mother, having power of his
3291	testiness, shall turn all into my commendations. My
3292	horse is tied up safe: out, sword, and to a sore
3293	purpose! Fortune, put them into my hand! This is
3294	the very description of their meeting-place; and
3295	the fellow dares not deceive me.

3309	
3310	
3311	[Enter, from the cave, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS,
3312	ARVIRAGUS, and IMOGEN]
3313	
3314	BELARIUS	[To IMOGEN]  You are not well: remain here in the cave;
3315	We'll come to you after hunting.
3316	
3317	ARVIRAGUS	[To IMOGEN]	Brother, stay here
3318	Are we not brothers?
3319	
3320	IMOGEN	So man and man should be;
3321	But clay and clay differs in dignity,
3322	Whose dust is both alike. I am very sick.
3323	
3324	GUIDERIUS	Go you to hunting; I'll abide with him.
3325	
3326	IMOGEN	So sick I am not, yet I am not well;
3327	But not so citizen a wanton as
3328	To seem to die ere sick: so please you, leave me;
3329	Stick to your journal course: the breach of custom
3330	Is breach of all. I am ill, but your being by me
3331	Cannot amend me; society is no comfort
3332	To one not sociable: I am not very sick,
3333	Since I can reason of it. Pray you, trust me here:
3334	I'll rob none but myself; and let me die,
3335	Stealing so poorly.
3336	
3337	GUIDERIUS	I love thee; I have spoke it
3338	How much the quantity, the weight as much,
3339	As I do love my father.
3340	
3341	BELARIUS	What! how! how!
3342	
3343	ARVIRAGUS	If it be sin to say so, I yoke me
3344	In my good brother's fault: I know not why
3345	I love this youth; and I have heard you say,
3346	Love's reason's without reason: the bier at door,
3347	And a demand who is't shall die, I'd say
3348	'My father, not this youth.'
3349	
3350	BELARIUS	[Aside]	O noble strain!
3351	O worthiness of nature! breed of greatness!
3352	Cowards father cowards and base things sire base:
3353	Nature hath meal and bran, contempt and grace.
3354	I'm not their father; yet who this should be,
3355	Doth miracle itself, loved before me.
3356	'Tis the ninth hour o' the morn.
3357	
3358	ARVIRAGUS	Brother, farewell.
3359	
3360	IMOGEN	I wish ye sport.
3361	
3362	ARVIRAGUS	                  You health. So please you, sir.
3363	
3364	IMOGEN	[Aside]  These are kind creatures. Gods, what lies
3365	I have heard!
3366	Our courtiers say all's savage but at court:
3367	Experience, O, thou disprovest report!
3368	The imperious seas breed monsters, for the dish
3369	Poor tributary rivers as sweet fish.
3370	I am sick still; heart-sick. Pisanio,
3371	I'll now taste of thy drug.
3372	
3373	[Swallows some]
3374	
3375	GUIDERIUS	I could not stir him:
3376	He said he was gentle, but unfortunate;
3377	Dishonestly afflicted, but yet honest.
3378	
3379	ARVIRAGUS	Thus did he answer me: yet said, hereafter
3380	I might know more.
3381	
3382	BELARIUS	To the field, to the field!
3383	We'll leave you for this time: go in and rest.
3384	
3385	ARVIRAGUS	We'll not be long away.
3386	
3387	BELARIUS	Pray, be not sick,
3388	For you must be our housewife.
3389	
3390	IMOGEN	Well or ill,
3391	I am bound to you.
3392	
3393	BELARIUS	And shalt be ever.
3394	
3395	[Exit IMOGEN, to the cave]
3396	
3397	This youth, how'er distress'd, appears he hath had
3398	Good ancestors.
3399	
3400	ARVIRAGUS	                  How angel-like he sings!
3401	
3402	GUIDERIUS	But his neat cookery! he cut our roots
3403	In characters,
3404	And sauced our broths, as Juno had been sick
3405	And he her dieter.
3406	
3407	ARVIRAGUS	Nobly he yokes
3408	A smiling with a sigh, as if the sigh
3409	Was that it was, for not being such a smile;
3410	The smile mocking the sigh, that it would fly
3411	From so divine a temple, to commix
3412	With winds that sailors rail at.
3413	
3414	GUIDERIUS	I do note
3415	That grief and patience, rooted in him both,
3416	Mingle their spurs together.
3417	
3418	ARVIRAGUS	Grow, patience!
3419	And let the stinking elder, grief, untwine
3420	His perishing root with the increasing vine!
3421	
3422	BELARIUS	It is great morning. Come, away!--
3423	Who's there?
3424	
3425	[Enter CLOTEN]
3426	
3427	CLOTEN	I cannot find those runagates; that villain
3428	Hath mock'd me. I am faint.
3429	
3430	BELARIUS	'Those runagates!'
3431	Means he not us? I partly know him: 'tis
3432	Cloten, the son o' the queen. I fear some ambush.
3433	I saw him not these many years, and yet
3434	I know 'tis he. We are held as outlaws: hence!
3435	
3436	GUIDERIUS	He is but one: you and my brother search
3437	What companies are near: pray you, away;
3438	Let me alone with him.
3439	
3440	[Exeunt BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS]
3441	
3442	CLOTEN	                  Soft! What are you
3443	That fly me thus? some villain mountaineers?
3444	I have heard of such. What slave art thou?
3445	
3446	GUIDERIUS	A thing
3447	More slavish did I ne'er than answering
3448	A slave without a knock.
3449	
3450	CLOTEN	Thou art a robber,
3451	A law-breaker, a villain: yield thee, thief.
3452	
3453	GUIDERIUS	To who? to thee? What art thou? Have not I
3454	An arm as big as thine? a heart as big?
3455	Thy words, I grant, are bigger, for I wear not
3456	My dagger in my mouth. Say what thou art,
3457	Why I should yield to thee?
3458	
3459	CLOTEN	Thou villain base,
3460	Know'st me not by my clothes?
3461	
3462	GUIDERIUS	No, nor thy tailor, rascal,
3463	Who is thy grandfather: he made those clothes,
3464	Which, as it seems, make thee.
3465	
3466	CLOTEN	Thou precious varlet,
3467	My tailor made them not.
3468	
3469	GUIDERIUS	Hence, then, and thank
3470	The man that gave them thee. Thou art some fool;
3471	I am loath to beat thee.
3472	
3473	CLOTEN	Thou injurious thief,
3474	Hear but my name, and tremble.
3475	
3476	GUIDERIUS	What's thy name?
3477	
3478	CLOTEN	Cloten, thou villain.
3479	
3480	GUIDERIUS	Cloten, thou double villain, be thy name,
3481	I cannot tremble at it: were it Toad, or
3482	Adder, Spider,
3483	'Twould move me sooner.
3484	
3485	CLOTEN	To thy further fear,
3486	Nay, to thy mere confusion, thou shalt know
3487	I am son to the queen.
3488	
3489	GUIDERIUS	I am sorry for 't; not seeming
3490	So worthy as thy birth.
3491	
3492	CLOTEN	Art not afeard?
3493	
3494	GUIDERIUS	Those that I reverence those I fear, the wise:
3495	At fools I laugh, not fear them.
3496	
3497	CLOTEN	Die the death:
3498	When I have slain thee with my proper hand,
3499	I'll follow those that even now fled hence,
3500	And on the gates of Lud's-town set your heads:
3501	Yield, rustic mountaineer.
3502	
3503	[Exeunt, fighting]
3504	
3505	[Re-enter BELARIUS and ARVIRAGUS]
3506	
3507	BELARIUS	No companies abroad?
3508	
3509	ARVIRAGUS	None in the world: you did mistake him, sure.
3510	
3511	BELARIUS	I cannot tell: long is it since I saw him,
3512	But time hath nothing blurr'd those lines of favour
3513	Which then he wore; the snatches in his voice,
3514	And burst of speaking, were as his: I am absolute
3515	'Twas very Cloten.
3516	
3517	ARVIRAGUS	                  In this place we left them:
3518	I wish my brother make good time with him,
3519	You say he is so fell.
3520	
3521	BELARIUS	Being scarce made up,
3522	I mean, to man, he had not apprehension
3523	Of roaring terrors; for the effect of judgment
3524	Is oft the cause of fear. But, see, thy brother.
3525	
3526	[Re-enter GUIDERIUS, with CLOTEN'S head]
3527	
3528	GUIDERIUS	This Cloten was a fool, an empty purse;
3529	There was no money in't: not Hercules
3530	Could have knock'd out his brains, for he had none:
3531	Yet I not doing this, the fool had borne
3532	My head as I do his.
3533	
3534	BELARIUS	What hast thou done?
3535	
3536	GUIDERIUS	I am perfect what: cut off one Cloten's head,
3537	Son to the queen, after his own report;
3538	Who call'd me traitor, mountaineer, and swore
3539	With his own single hand he'ld take us in
3540	Displace our heads where--thank the gods!--they grow,
3541	And set them on Lud's-town.
3542	
3543	BELARIUS	We are all undone.
3544	
3545	GUIDERIUS	Why, worthy father, what have we to lose,
3546	But that he swore to take, our lives? The law
3547	Protects not us: then why should we be tender
3548	To let an arrogant piece of flesh threat us,
3549	Play judge and executioner all himself,
3550	For we do fear the law? What company
3551	Discover you abroad?
3552	
3553	BELARIUS	No single soul
3554	Can we set eye on; but in all safe reason
3555	He must have some attendants. Though his humour
3556	Was nothing but mutation, ay, and that
3557	From one bad thing to worse; not frenzy, not
3558	Absolute madness could so far have raved
3559	To bring him here alone; although perhaps
3560	It may be heard at court that such as we
3561	Cave here, hunt here, are outlaws, and in time
3562	May make some stronger head; the which he hearing--
3563	As it is like him--might break out, and swear
3564	He'ld fetch us in; yet is't not probable
3565	To come alone, either he so undertaking,
3566	Or they so suffering: then on good ground we fear,
3567	If we do fear this body hath a tail
3568	More perilous than the head.
3569	
3570	ARVIRAGUS	Let ordinance
3571	Come as the gods foresay it: howsoe'er,
3572	My brother hath done well.
3573	
3574	BELARIUS	I had no mind
3575	To hunt this day: the boy Fidele's sickness
3576	Did make my way long forth.
3577	
3578	GUIDERIUS	With his own sword,
3579	Which he did wave against my throat, I have ta'en
3580	His head from him: I'll throw't into the creek
3581	Behind our rock; and let it to the sea,
3582	And tell the fishes he's the queen's son, Cloten:
3583	That's all I reck.
3584	
3585	[Exit]
3586	
3587	BELARIUS	I fear 'twill be revenged:
3588	Would, Polydote, thou hadst not done't! though valour
3589	Becomes thee well enough.
3590	
3591	ARVIRAGUS	Would I had done't
3592	So the revenge alone pursued me! Polydore,
3593	I love thee brotherly, but envy much
3594	Thou hast robb'd me of this deed: I would revenges,
3595	That possible strength might meet, would seek us through
3596	And put us to our answer.
3597	
3598	BELARIUS	Well, 'tis done:
3599	We'll hunt no more to-day, nor seek for danger
3600	Where there's no profit. I prithee, to our rock;
3601	You and Fidele play the cooks: I'll stay
3602	Till hasty Polydote return, and bring him
3603	To dinner presently.
3604	
3605	ARVIRAGUS	Poor sick Fidele!
3606	I'll weringly to him: to gain his colour
3607	I'ld let a parish of such Clotens' blood,
3608	And praise myself for charity.
3609	
3610	[Exit]
3611	
3612	BELARIUS	O thou goddess,
3613	Thou divine Nature, how thyself thou blazon'st
3614	In these two princely boys! They are as gentle
3615	As zephyrs blowing below the violet,
3616	Not wagging his sweet head; and yet as rough,
3617	Their royal blood enchafed, as the rudest wind,
3618	That by the top doth take the mountain pine,
3619	And make him stoop to the vale. 'Tis wonder
3620	That an invisible instinct should frame them
3621	To royalty unlearn'd, honour untaught,
3622	Civility not seen from other, valour
3623	That wildly grows in them, but yields a crop
3624	As if it had been sow'd. Yet still it's strange
3625	What Cloten's being here to us portends,
3626	Or what his death will bring us.
3627	
3628	[Re-enter GUIDERIUS]
3629	
3630	GUIDERIUS	Where's my brother?
3631	I have sent Cloten's clotpoll down the stream,
3632	In embassy to his mother: his body's hostage
3633	For his return.
3634	
3635	[Solemn music]
3636	
3637	BELARIUS	                  My ingenious instrument!
3638	Hark, Polydore, it sounds! But what occasion
3639	Hath Cadwal now to give it motion? Hark!
3640	
3641	GUIDERIUS	Is he at home?
3642	
3643	BELARIUS	                  He went hence even now.
3644	
3645	GUIDERIUS	What does he mean? since death of my dear'st mother
3646	it did not speak before. All solemn things
3647	Should answer solemn accidents. The matter?
3648	Triumphs for nothing and lamenting toys
3649	Is jollity for apes and grief for boys.
3650	Is Cadwal mad?
3651	
3652	BELARIUS	                  Look, here he comes,
3653	And brings the dire occasion in his arms
3654	Of what we blame him for.
3655	
3656	[Re-enter ARVIRAGUS, with IMOGEN, as dead,
3657	bearing her in his arms]
3658	
3659	ARVIRAGUS	The bird is dead
3660	That we have made so much on. I had rather
3661	Have skipp'd from sixteen years of age to sixty,
3662	To have turn'd my leaping-time into a crutch,
3663	Than have seen this.
3664	
3665	GUIDERIUS	O sweetest, fairest lily!
3666	My brother wears thee not the one half so well
3667	As when thou grew'st thyself.
3668	
3669	BELARIUS	O melancholy!
3670	Who ever yet could sound thy bottom? find
3671	The ooze, to show what coast thy sluggish crare
3672	Might easiliest harbour in? Thou blessed thing!
3673	Jove knows what man thou mightst have made; but I,
3674	Thou diedst, a most rare boy, of melancholy.
3675	How found you him?
3676	
3677	ARVIRAGUS	Stark, as you see:
3678	Thus smiling, as some fly hid tickled slumber,
3679	Not as death's dart, being laugh'd at; his
3680	right cheek
3681	Reposing on a cushion.
3682	
3683	GUIDERIUS	Where?
3684	
3685	ARVIRAGUS	O' the floor;
3686	His arms thus leagued: I thought he slept, and put
3687	My clouted brogues from off my feet, whose rudeness
3688	Answer'd my steps too loud.
3689	
3690	GUIDERIUS	Why, he but sleeps:
3691	If he be gone, he'll make his grave a bed;
3692	With female fairies will his tomb be haunted,
3693	And worms will not come to thee.
3694	
3695	ARVIRAGUS	With fairest flowers
3696	Whilst summer lasts and I live here, Fidele,
3697	I'll sweeten thy sad grave: thou shalt not lack
3698	The flower that's like thy face, pale primrose, nor
3699	The azured harebell, like thy veins, no, nor
3700	The leaf of eglantine, whom not to slander,
3701	Out-sweeten'd not thy breath: the ruddock would,
3702	With charitable bill,--O bill, sore-shaming
3703	Those rich-left heirs that let their fathers lie
3704	Without a monument!--bring thee all this;
3705	Yea, and furr'd moss besides, when flowers are none,
3706	To winter-ground thy corse.
3707	
3708	GUIDERIUS	Prithee, have done;
3709	And do not play in wench-like words with that
3710	Which is so serious. Let us bury him,
3711	And not protract with admiration what
3712	Is now due debt. To the grave!
3713	
3714	ARVIRAGUS	Say, where shall's lay him?
3715	
3716	GUIDERIUS	By good Euriphile, our mother.
3717	
3718	ARVIRAGUS	Be't so:
3719	And let us, Polydore, though now our voices
3720	Have got the mannish crack, sing him to the ground,
3721	As once our mother; use like note and words,
3722	Save that Euriphile must be Fidele.
3723	
3724	GUIDERIUS	Cadwal,
3725	I cannot sing: I'll weep, and word it with thee;
3726	For notes of sorrow out of tune are worse
3727	Than priests and fanes that lie.
3728	
3729	ARVIRAGUS	We'll speak it, then.
3730	
3731	BELARIUS	Great griefs, I see, medicine the less; for Cloten
3732	Is quite forgot. He was a queen's son, boys;
3733	And though he came our enemy, remember
3734	He was paid for that: though mean and
3735	mighty, rotting
3736	Together, have one dust, yet reverence,
3737	That angel of the world, doth make distinction
3738	Of place 'tween high and low. Our foe was princely
3739	And though you took his life, as being our foe,
3740	Yet bury him as a prince.
3741	
3742	GUIDERIUS	Pray You, fetch him hither.
3743	Thersites' body is as good as Ajax',
3744	When neither are alive.
3745	
3746	ARVIRAGUS	If you'll go fetch him,
3747	We'll say our song the whilst. Brother, begin.
3748	
3749	[Exit BELARIUS]
3750	
3751	GUIDERIUS	Nay, Cadwal, we must lay his head to the east;
3752	My father hath a reason for't.
3753	
3754	ARVIRAGUS	'Tis true.
3755	
3756	GUIDERIUS	Come on then, and remove him.
3757	
3758	ARVIRAGUS	So. Begin.
3759	[SONG]
3760	
3761	GUIDERIUS	     Fear no more the heat o' the sun,
3762	Nor the furious winter's rages;
3763	Thou thy worldly task hast done,
3764	Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
3765	Golden lads and girls all must,
3766	As chimney-sweepers, come to dust.
3767	
3768	ARVIRAGUS	     Fear no more the frown o' the great;
3769	Thou art past the tyrant's stroke;
3770	Care no more to clothe and eat;
3771	To thee the reed is as the oak:
3772	The sceptre, learning, physic, must
3773	All follow this, and come to dust.
3774	
3775	GUIDERIUS	     Fear no more the lightning flash,
3776	
3777	ARVIRAGUS	        Nor the all-dreaded thunder-stone;
3778	
3779	GUIDERIUS	     Fear not slander, censure rash;
3780	
3781	ARVIRAGUS	        Thou hast finish'd joy and moan:
3782	
3783	
3784	GUIDERIUS	|
3785	|  All lovers young, all lovers must
3786	ARVIRAGUS	|   Consign to thee, and come to dust.
3787	
3788	
3789	GUIDERIUS	     No exorciser harm thee!
3790	
3791	ARVIRAGUS	        Nor no witchcraft charm thee!
3792	
3793	GUIDERIUS	     Ghost unlaid forbear thee!
3794	
3795	ARVIRAGUS	        Nothing ill come near thee!
3796	
3797	
3798	GUIDERIUS	|
3799	|   Quiet consummation have;
3800	ARVIRAGUS	|    And renowned be thy grave!
3801	
3802	
3803	[Re-enter BELARIUS, with the body of CLOTEN]
3804	
3805	GUIDERIUS	We have done our obsequies: come, lay him down.
3806	
3807	BELARIUS	Here's a few flowers; but 'bout midnight, more:
3808	The herbs that have on them cold dew o' the night
3809	Are strewings fitt'st for graves. Upon their faces.
3810	You were as flowers, now wither'd: even so
3811	These herblets shall, which we upon you strew.
3812	Come on, away: apart upon our knees.
3813	The ground that gave them first has them again:
3814	Their pleasures here are past, so is their pain.
3815	
3816	[Exeunt BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]
3817	
3818	IMOGEN	[Awaking]  Yes, sir, to Milford-Haven; which is
3819	the way?--
3820	I thank you.--By yond bush?--Pray, how far thither?
3821	'Ods pittikins! can it be six mile yet?--
3822	I have gone all night. 'Faith, I'll lie down and sleep.
3823	But, soft! no bedfellow!--O gods and goddesses!
3824	
3825	[Seeing the body of CLOTEN]
3826	
3827	These flowers are like the pleasures of the world;
3828	This bloody man, the care on't. I hope I dream;
3829	For so I thought I was a cave-keeper,
3830	And cook to honest creatures: but 'tis not so;
3831	'Twas but a bolt of nothing, shot at nothing,
3832	Which the brain makes of fumes: our very eyes
3833	Are sometimes like our judgments, blind. Good faith,
3834	I tremble stiff with fear: but if there be
3835	Yet left in heaven as small a drop of pity
3836	As a wren's eye, fear'd gods, a part of it!
3837	The dream's here still: even when I wake, it is
3838	Without me, as within me; not imagined, felt.
3839	A headless man! The garments of Posthumus!
3840	I know the shape of's leg: this is his hand;
3841	His foot Mercurial; his Martial thigh;
3842	The brawns of Hercules: but his Jovial face
3843	Murder in heaven?--How!--'Tis gone. Pisanio,
3844	All curses madded Hecuba gave the Greeks,
3845	And mine to boot, be darted on thee! Thou,
3846	Conspired with that irregulous devil, Cloten,
3847	Hast here cut off my lord. To write and read
3848	Be henceforth treacherous! Damn'd Pisanio
3849	Hath with his forged letters,--damn'd Pisanio--
3850	From this most bravest vessel of the world
3851	Struck the main-top! O Posthumus! alas,
3852	Where is thy head? where's that? Ay me!
3853	where's that?
3854	Pisanio might have kill'd thee at the heart,
3855	And left this head on. How should this be? Pisanio?
3856	'Tis he and Cloten: malice and lucre in them
3857	Have laid this woe here. O, 'tis pregnant, pregnant!
3858	The drug he gave me, which he said was precious
3859	And cordial to me, have I not found it
3860	Murderous to the senses? That confirms it home:
3861	This is Pisanio's deed, and Cloten's: O!
3862	Give colour to my pale cheek with thy blood,
3863	That we the horrider may seem to those
3864	Which chance to find us: O, my lord, my lord!
3865	
3866	[Falls on the body]
3867	
3868	[Enter LUCIUS, a Captain and other Officers,
3869	and a Soothsayer]
3870	
3871	Captain	To them the legions garrison'd in Gailia,
3872	After your will, have cross'd the sea, attending
3873	You here at Milford-Haven with your ships:
3874	They are in readiness.
3875	
3876	CAIUS LUCIUS	But what from Rome?
3877	
3878	Captain	The senate hath stirr'd up the confiners
3879	And gentlemen of Italy, most willing spirits,
3880	That promise noble service: and they come
3881	Under the conduct of bold Iachimo,
3882	Syenna's brother.
3883	
3884	CAIUS LUCIUS	                  When expect you them?
3885	
3886	Captain	With the next benefit o' the wind.
3887	
3888	CAIUS LUCIUS	This forwardness
3889	Makes our hopes fair. Command our present numbers
3890	Be muster'd; bid the captains look to't. Now, sir,
3891	What have you dream'd of late of this war's purpose?
3892	
3893	Soothsayer	Last night the very gods show'd me a vision--
3894	I fast and pray'd for their intelligence--thus:
3895	I saw Jove's bird, the Roman eagle, wing'd
3896	From the spongy south to this part of the west,
3897	There vanish'd in the sunbeams: which portends--
3898	Unless my sins abuse my divination--
3899	Success to the Roman host.
3900	
3901	CAIUS LUCIUS	Dream often so,
3902	And never false. Soft, ho! what trunk is here
3903	Without his top? The ruin speaks that sometime
3904	It was a worthy building. How! a page!
3905	Or dead, or sleeping on him? But dead rather;
3906	For nature doth abhor to make his bed
3907	With the defunct, or sleep upon the dead.
3908	Let's see the boy's face.
3909	
3910	Captain	He's alive, my lord.
3911	
3912	CAIUS LUCIUS	He'll then instruct us of this body. Young one,
3913	Inform us of thy fortunes, for it seems
3914	They crave to be demanded. Who is this
3915	Thou makest thy bloody pillow? Or who was he
3916	That, otherwise than noble nature did,
3917	Hath alter'd that good picture? What's thy interest
3918	In this sad wreck? How came it? Who is it?
3919	What art thou?
3920	
3921	IMOGEN	                  I am nothing: or if not,
3922	Nothing to be were better. This was my master,
3923	A very valiant Briton and a good,
3924	That here by mountaineers lies slain. Alas!
3925	There is no more such masters: I may wander
3926	From east to occident, cry out for service,
3927	Try many, all good, serve truly, never
3928	Find such another master.
3929	
3930	CAIUS LUCIUS	'Lack, good youth!
3931	Thou movest no less with thy complaining than
3932	Thy master in bleeding: say his name, good friend.
3933	
3934	IMOGEN	Richard du Champ.
3935	
3936	[Aside]
3937	
3938	If I do lie and do
3939	No harm by it, though the gods hear, I hope
3940	They'll pardon it.--Say you, sir?
3941	
3942	CAIUS LUCIUS	Thy name?
3943	
3944	IMOGEN	Fidele, sir.
3945	
3946	CAIUS LUCIUS	Thou dost approve thyself the very same:
3947	Thy name well fits thy faith, thy faith thy name.
3948	Wilt take thy chance with me? I will not say
3949	Thou shalt be so well master'd, but, be sure,
3950	No less beloved. The Roman emperor's letters,
3951	Sent by a consul to me, should not sooner
3952	Than thine own worth prefer thee: go with me.
3953	
3954	IMOGEN	I'll follow, sir. But first, an't please the gods,
3955	I'll hide my master from the flies, as deep
3956	As these poor pickaxes can dig; and when
3957	With wild wood-leaves and weeds I ha' strew'd his grave,
3958	And on it said a century of prayers,
3959	Such as I can, twice o'er, I'll weep and sigh;
3960	And leaving so his service, follow you,
3961	So please you entertain me.
3962	
3963	CAIUS LUCIUS	Ay, good youth!
3964	And rather father thee than master thee.
3965	My friends,
3966	The boy hath taught us manly duties: let us
3967	Find out the prettiest daisied plot we can,
3968	And make him with our pikes and partisans
3969	A grave: come, arm him. Boy, he is preferr'd
3970	By thee to us, and he shall be interr'd
3971	As soldiers can. Be cheerful; wipe thine eyes
3972	Some falls are means the happier to arise.

3991	CYMBELINE	Again; and bring me word how 'tis with her.
3992	
3993	[Exit an Attendant]
3994	
3995	A fever with the absence of her son,
3996	A madness, of which her life's in danger. Heavens,
3997	How deeply you at once do touch me! Imogen,
3998	The great part of my comfort, gone; my queen
3999	Upon a desperate bed, and in a time
4000	When fearful wars point at me; her son gone,
4001	So needful for this present: it strikes me, past
4002	The hope of comfort. But for thee, fellow,
4003	Who needs must know of her departure and
4004	Dost seem so ignorant, we'll enforce it from thee
4005	By a sharp torture.
4006	
4007	PISANIO	Sir, my life is yours;
4008	I humbly set it at your will; but, for my mistress,
4009	I nothing know where she remains, why gone,
4010	Nor when she purposes return. Beseech your highness,
4011	Hold me your loyal servant.
4012	
4013	First Lord	Good my liege,
4014	The day that she was missing he was here:
4015	I dare be bound he's true and shall perform
4016	All parts of his subjection loyally. For Cloten,
4017	There wants no diligence in seeking him,
4018	And will, no doubt, be found.
4019	
4020	CYMBELINE	The time is troublesome.
4021	
4022	[To PISANIO]
4023	
4024	We'll slip you for a season; but our jealousy
4025	Does yet depend.
4026	
4027	First Lord	                  So please your majesty,
4028	The Roman legions, all from Gallia drawn,
4029	Are landed on your coast, with a supply
4030	Of Roman gentlemen, by the senate sent.
4031	
4032	CYMBELINE	Now for the counsel of my son and queen!
4033	I am amazed with matter.
4034	
4035	First Lord	Good my liege,
4036	Your preparation can affront no less
4037	Than what you hear of: come more, for more
4038	you're ready:
4039	The want is but to put those powers in motion
4040	That long to move.
4041	
4042	CYMBELINE	                  I thank you. Let's withdraw;
4043	And meet the time as it seeks us. We fear not
4044	What can from Italy annoy us; but
4045	We grieve at chances here. Away!
4046	
4047	[Exeunt all but PISANIO]
4048	
4049	PISANIO	I heard no letter from my master since
4050	I wrote him Imogen was slain: 'tis strange:
4051	Nor hear I from my mistress who did promise
4052	To yield me often tidings: neither know I
4053	What is betid to Cloten; but remain
4054	Perplex'd in all. The heavens still must work.
4055	Wherein I am false I am honest; not true, to be true.
4056	These present wars shall find I love my country,
4057	Even to the note o' the king, or I'll fall in them.
4058	All other doubts, by time let them be clear'd:
4059	Fortune brings in some boats that are not steer'd.

4079	
4080	BELARIUS	Let us from it.
4081	
4082	ARVIRAGUS	What pleasure, sir, find we in life, to lock it
4083	From action and adventure?
4084	
4085	GUIDERIUS	Nay, what hope
4086	Have we in hiding us? This way, the Romans
4087	Must or for Britons slay us, or receive us
4088	For barbarous and unnatural revolts
4089	During their use, and slay us after.
4090	
4091	BELARIUS	Sons,
4092	We'll higher to the mountains; there secure us.
4093	To the king's party there's no going: newness
4094	Of Cloten's death--we being not known, not muster'd
4095	Among the bands--may drive us to a render
4096	Where we have lived, and so extort from's that
4097	Which we have done, whose answer would be death
4098	Drawn on with torture.
4099	
4100	GUIDERIUS	This is, sir, a doubt
4101	In such a time nothing becoming you,
4102	Nor satisfying us.
4103	
4104	ARVIRAGUS	                  It is not likely
4105	That when they hear the Roman horses neigh,
4106	Behold their quarter'd fires, have both their eyes
4107	And ears so cloy'd importantly as now,
4108	That they will waste their time upon our note,
4109	To know from whence we are.
4110	
4111	BELARIUS	O, I am known
4112	Of many in the army: many years,
4113	Though Cloten then but young, you see, not wore him
4114	From my remembrance. And, besides, the king
4115	Hath not deserved my service nor your loves;
4116	Who find in my exile the want of breeding,
4117	The certainty of this hard life; aye hopeless
4118	To have the courtesy your cradle promised,
4119	But to be still hot summer's tamings and
4120	The shrinking slaves of winter.
4121	
4122	GUIDERIUS	Than be so
4123	Better to cease to be. Pray, sir, to the army:
4124	I and my brother are not known; yourself
4125	So out of thought, and thereto so o'ergrown,
4126	Cannot be question'd.
4127	
4128	ARVIRAGUS	By this sun that shines,
4129	I'll thither: what thing is it that I never
4130	Did see man die! scarce ever look'd on blood,
4131	But that of coward hares, hot goats, and venison!
4132	Never bestrid a horse, save one that had
4133	A rider like myself, who ne'er wore rowel
4134	Nor iron on his heel! I am ashamed
4135	To look upon the holy sun, to have
4136	The benefit of his blest beams, remaining
4137	So long a poor unknown.
4138	
4139	GUIDERIUS	By heavens, I'll go:
4140	If you will bless me, sir, and give me leave,
4141	I'll take the better care, but if you will not,
4142	The hazard therefore due fall on me by
4143	The hands of Romans!
4144	
4145	ARVIRAGUS	So say I	amen.
4146	
4147	BELARIUS	No reason I, since of your lives you set
4148	So slight a valuation, should reserve
4149	My crack'd one to more care. Have with you, boys!
4150	If in your country wars you chance to die,

4177	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Yea, bloody cloth, I'll keep thee, for I wish'd

4179	If each of you should take this course, how many
4180	Must murder wives much better than themselves
4181	For wrying but a little! O Pisanio!
4182	Every good servant does not all commands:
4183	No bond but to do just ones. Gods! if you
4184	Should have ta'en vengeance on my faults, I never
4185	Had lived to put on this: so had you saved
4186	The noble Imogen to repent, and struck
4187	Me, wretch more worth your vengeance. But, alack,
4188	You snatch some hence for little faults; that's love,
4189	To have them fall no more: you some permit
4190	To second ills with ills, each elder worse,
4191	And make them dread it, to the doers' thrift.
4192	But Imogen is your own: do your best wills,
4193	And make me blest to obey! I am brought hither
4194	Among the Italian gentry, and to fight
4195	Against my lady's kingdom: 'tis enough
4196	That, Britain, I have kill'd thy mistress; peace!
4197	I'll give no wound to thee. Therefore, good heavens,
4198	Hear patiently my purpose: I'll disrobe me
4199	Of these Italian weeds and suit myself
4200	As does a Briton peasant: so I'll fight
4201	Against the part I come with; so I'll die
4202	For thee, O Imogen, even for whom my life
4203	Is every breath a death; and thus, unknown,
4204	Pitied nor hated, to the face of peril
4205	Myself I'll dedicate. Let me make men know
4206	More valour in me than my habits show.
4207	Gods, put the strength o' the Leonati in me!
4208	To shame the guise o' the world, I will begin
4209	The fashion, less without and more within.

4240	As I wear mine, are titles but of scorn.
4241	If that thy gentry, Britain, go before
4242	This lout as he exceeds our lords, the odds
4243	Is that we scarce are men and you are gods.
4244	
4245	[Exit]

4247	[The battle continues; the Britons fly; CYMBELINE is
4248	taken: then enter, to his rescue, BELARIUS,
4249	GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]
4250	
4251	BELARIUS	Stand, stand! We have the advantage of the ground;
4252	The lane is guarded: nothing routs us but
4253	The villany of our fears.

4261	[Re-enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS, and seconds the
4262	Britons: they rescue CYMBELINE, and exeunt. Then
4263	re-enter LUCIUS, and IACHIMO, with IMOGEN]
4264	
4265	CAIUS LUCIUS	Away, boy, from the troops, and save thyself;
4266	For friends kill friends, and the disorder's such
4267	As war were hoodwink'd.
4268	
4269	IACHIMO	'Tis their fresh supplies.
4270	
4271	CAIUS LUCIUS	It is a day turn'd strangely: or betimes
4272	Let's reinforce, or fly.

4281	
4282	ACT V
4283	
4284	
4285	
4286	SCENE III	Another part of the field.
4287	
4288	
4289	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and a British Lord]
4290	
4291	Lord	Camest thou from where they made the stand?
4292	
4293	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I did.
4294	Though you, it seems, come from the fliers.
4295	
4296	Lord	I did.
4297	
4298	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	No blame be to you, sir; for all was lost,
4299	But that the heavens fought: the king himself
4300	Of his wings destitute, the army broken,
4301	And but the backs of Britons seen, all flying
4302	Through a straight lane; the enemy full-hearted,
4303	Lolling the tongue with slaughtering, having work
4304	More plentiful than tools to do't, struck down
4305	Some mortally, some slightly touch'd, some falling
4306	Merely through fear; that the straight pass was damm'd
4307	With dead men hurt behind, and cowards living
4308	To die with lengthen'd shame.
4309	
4310	Lord	Where was this lane?
4311	
4312	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Close by the battle, ditch'd, and wall'd with turf;
4313	Which gave advantage to an ancient soldier,
4314	An honest one, I warrant; who deserved
4315	So long a breeding as his white beard came to,
4316	In doing this for's country: athwart the lane,
4317	He, with two striplings-lads more like to run
4318	The country base than to commit such slaughter
4319	With faces fit for masks, or rather fairer
4320	Than those for preservation cased, or shame--
4321	Made good the passage; cried to those that fled,
4322	'Our Britain s harts die flying, not our men:
4323	To darkness fleet souls that fly backwards. Stand;
4324	Or we are Romans and will give you that
4325	Like beasts which you shun beastly, and may save,
4326	But to look back in frown: stand, stand.'
4327	These three,
4328	Three thousand confident, in act as many--
4329	For three performers are the file when all
4330	The rest do nothing--with this word 'Stand, stand,'
4331	Accommodated by the place, more charming
4332	With their own nobleness, which could have turn'd
4333	A distaff to a lance, gilded pale looks,
4334	Part shame, part spirit renew'd; that some,
4335	turn'd coward
4336	But by example--O, a sin in war,
4337	Damn'd in the first beginners!--gan to look
4338	The way that they did, and to grin like lions
4339	Upon the pikes o' the hunters. Then began
4340	A stop i' the chaser, a retire, anon
4341	A rout, confusion thick; forthwith they fly
4342	Chickens, the way which they stoop'd eagles; slaves,
4343	The strides they victors made: and now our cowards,
4344	Like fragments in hard voyages, became
4345	The life o' the need: having found the backdoor open
4346	Of the unguarded hearts, heavens, how they wound!
4347	Some slain before; some dying; some their friends
4348	O'er borne i' the former wave: ten, chased by one,
4349	Are now each one the slaughter-man of twenty:
4350	Those that would die or ere resist are grown
4351	The mortal bugs o' the field.
4352	
4353	Lord	This was strange chance
4354	A narrow lane, an old man, and two boys.
4355	
4356	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Nay, do not wonder at it: you are made
4357	Rather to wonder at the things you hear
4358	Than to work any. Will you rhyme upon't,
4359	And vent it for a mockery? Here is one:
4360	'Two boys, an old man twice a boy, a lane,
4361	Preserved the Britons, was the Romans' bane.'
4362	
4363	Lord	Nay, be not angry, sir.
4364	
4365	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	'Lack, to what end?
4366	Who dares not stand his foe, I'll be his friend;
4367	For if he'll do as he is made to do,
4368	I know he'll quickly fly my friendship too.
4369	You have put me into rhyme.
4370	
4371	Lord	Farewell; you're angry.
4372	
4373	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Still going?
4374	
4375	[Exit Lord]
4376	
4377	This is a lord! O noble misery,
4378	To be i' the field, and ask 'what news?' of me!
4379	To-day how many would have given their honours
4380	To have saved their carcasses! took heel to do't,
4381	And yet died too! I, in mine own woe charm'd,
4382	Could not find death where I did hear him groan,
4383	Nor feel him where he struck: being an ugly monster,
4384	'Tis strange he hides him in fresh cups, soft beds,
4385	Sweet words; or hath more ministers than we
4386	That draw his knives i' the war. Well, I will find him
4387	For being now a favourer to the Briton,
4388	No more a Briton, I have resumed again
4389	The part I came in: fight I will no more,
4390	But yield me to the veriest hind that shall
4391	Once touch my shoulder. Great the slaughter is
4392	Here made by the Roman; great the answer be
4393	Britons must take. For me, my ransom's death;
4394	On either side I come to spend my breath;
4395	Which neither here I'll keep nor bear again,
4396	But end it by some means for Imogen.
4397	
4398	[Enter two British Captains and Soldiers]
4399	
4400	First Captain	Great Jupiter be praised! Lucius is taken.
4401	'Tis thought the old man and his sons were angels.
4402	
4403	Second Captain	There was a fourth man, in a silly habit,
4404	That gave the affront with them.
4405	
4406	First Captain	So 'tis reported:
4407	But none of 'em can be found. Stand! who's there?
4408	
4409	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	A Roman,
4410	Who had not now been drooping here, if seconds
4411	Had answer'd him.
4412	
4413	Second Captain	                  Lay hands on him; a dog!
4414	A leg of Rome shall not return to tell
4415	What crows have peck'd them here. He brags
4416	his service
4417	As if he were of note: bring him to the king.
4418	
4419	[Enter CYMBELINE, BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, ARVIRAGUS,
4420	PISANIO, Soldiers, Attendants, and Roman Captives.
4421	The Captains present POSTHUMUS LEONATUS to
4422	CYMBELINE, who delivers him over to a Gaoler:
4423	then exeunt omnes]

4434	
4435	SCENE IV	A British prison.
4436	
4437	
4438	[Enter POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and two Gaolers]
4439	
4440	First Gaoler	You shall not now be stol'n, you have locks upon you;
4441	So graze as you find pasture.
4442	
4443	Second Gaoler	Ay, or a stomach.
4444	
4445	[Exeunt Gaolers]
4446	
4447	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Most welcome, bondage! for thou art away,
4448	think, to liberty: yet am I better
4449	Than one that's sick o' the gout; since he had rather
4450	Groan so in perpetuity than be cured
4451	By the sure physician, death, who is the key
4452	To unbar these locks. My conscience, thou art fetter'd
4453	More than my shanks and wrists: you good gods, give me
4454	The penitent instrument to pick that bolt,
4455	Then, free for ever! Is't enough I am sorry?
4456	So children temporal fathers do appease;
4457	Gods are more full of mercy. Must I repent?
4458	I cannot do it better than in gyves,
4459	Desired more than constrain'd: to satisfy,
4460	If of my freedom 'tis the main part, take
4461	No stricter render of me than my all.
4462	I know you are more clement than vile men,
4463	Who of their broken debtors take a third,
4464	A sixth, a tenth, letting them thrive again
4465	On their abatement: that's not my desire:
4466	For Imogen's dear life take mine; and though
4467	'Tis not so dear, yet 'tis a life; you coin'd it:
4468	'Tween man and man they weigh not every stamp;
4469	Though light, take pieces for the figure's sake:
4470	You rather mine, being yours: and so, great powers,
4471	If you will take this audit, take this life,
4472	And cancel these cold bonds. O Imogen!
4473	I'll speak to thee in silence.
4474	
4475	[Sleeps]
4476	
4477	[Solemn music. Enter, as in an apparition,
4478	SICILIUS LEONATUS, father to Posthumus Leonatus,
4479	an old man, attired like a warrior; leading in
4480	his hand an ancient matron, his wife, and mother
4481	to Posthumus Leonatus, with music before them:
4482	then, after other music, follow the two young
4483	Leonati, brothers to Posthumus Leonatus, with
4484	wounds as they died in the wars. They circle
4485	Posthumus Leonatus round, as he lies sleeping]
4486	
4487	Sicilius Leonatus	No more, thou thunder-master, show
4488	Thy spite on mortal flies:
4489	With Mars fall out, with Juno chide,
4490	That thy adulteries
4491	Rates and revenges.
4492	Hath my poor boy done aught but well,
4493	Whose face I never saw?
4494	I died whilst in the womb he stay'd
4495	Attending nature's law:
4496	Whose father then, as men report
4497	Thou orphans' father art,
4498	Thou shouldst have been, and shielded him
4499	From this earth-vexing smart.
4500	
4501	Mother	Lucina lent not me her aid,
4502	But took me in my throes;
4503	That from me was Posthumus ript,
4504	Came crying 'mongst his foes,
4505	A thing of pity!
4506	
4507	Sicilius Leonatus	Great nature, like his ancestry,
4508	Moulded the stuff so fair,
4509	That he deserved the praise o' the world,
4510	As great Sicilius' heir.
4511	
4512	First Brother	When once he was mature for man,
4513	In Britain where was he
4514	That could stand up his parallel;
4515	Or fruitful object be
4516	In eye of Imogen, that best
4517	Could deem his dignity?
4518	
4519	Mother	With marriage wherefore was he mock'd,
4520	To be exiled, and thrown
4521	From Leonati seat, and cast
4522	From her his dearest one,
4523	Sweet Imogen?
4524	
4525	Sicilius Leonatus	Why did you suffer Iachimo,
4526	Slight thing of Italy,
4527	To taint his nobler heart and brain
4528	With needless jealosy;
4529	And to become the geck and scorn
4530	O' th' other's villany?
4531	
4532	Second Brother	For this from stiller seats we came,
4533	Our parents and us twain,
4534	That striking in our country's cause
4535	Fell bravely and were slain,
4536	Our fealty and Tenantius' right
4537	With honour to maintain.
4538	
4539	First Brother	Like hardiment Posthumus hath
4540	To Cymbeline perform'd:
4541	Then, Jupiter, thou king of gods,
4542	Why hast thou thus adjourn'd
4543	The graces for his merits due,
4544	Being all to dolours turn'd?
4545	
4546	Sicilius Leonatus	Thy crystal window ope; look out;
4547	No longer exercise
4548	Upon a valiant race thy harsh
4549	And potent injuries.
4550	
4551	Mother	Since, Jupiter, our son is good,
4552	Take off his miseries.
4553	
4554	Sicilius Leonatus	Peep through thy marble mansion; help;
4555	Or we poor ghosts will cry
4556	To the shining synod of the rest
4557	Against thy deity.
4558	
4559	
4560	First Brother	|   Help, Jupiter; or we appeal,
4561	|   And from thy justice fly.
4562	Second Brother	|
4563	
4564	
4565	[Jupiter descends in thunder and lightning, sitting
4566	upon an eagle: he throws a thunderbolt. The
4567	Apparitions fall on their knees]
4568	
4569	Jupiter	No more, you petty spirits of region low,
4570	Offend our hearing; hush! How dare you ghosts
4571	Accuse the thunderer, whose bolt, you know,
4572	Sky-planted batters all rebelling coasts?
4573	Poor shadows of Elysium, hence, and rest
4574	Upon your never-withering banks of flowers:
4575	Be not with mortal accidents opprest;
4576	No care of yours it is; you know 'tis ours.
4577	Whom best I love I cross; to make my gift,
4578	The more delay'd, delighted. Be content;
4579	Your low-laid son our godhead will uplift:
4580	His comforts thrive, his trials well are spent.
4581	Our Jovial star reign'd at his birth, and in
4582	Our temple was he married. Rise, and fade.
4583	He shall be lord of lady Imogen,
4584	And happier much by his affliction made.
4585	This tablet lay upon his breast, wherein
4586	Our pleasure his full fortune doth confine:
4587	and so, away: no further with your din
4588	Express impatience, lest you stir up mine.
4589	Mount, eagle, to my palace crystalline.
4590	
4591	[Ascends]
4592	
4593	Sicilius Leonatus	He came in thunder; his celestial breath
4594	Was sulphurous to smell: the holy eagle
4595	Stoop'd as to foot us: his ascension is
4596	More sweet than our blest fields: his royal bird
4597	Prunes the immortal wing and cloys his beak,
4598	As when his god is pleased.
4599	
4600	All	Thanks, Jupiter!
4601	
4602	Sicilius Leonatus	The marble pavement closes, he is enter'd
4603	His radiant root. Away! and, to be blest,
4604	Let us with care perform his great behest.
4605	
4606	[The Apparitions vanish]
4607	
4608	Posthumus Leonatus	[Waking]  Sleep, thou hast been a grandsire, and begot
4609	A father to me; and thou hast created
4610	A mother and two brothers: but, O scorn!
4611	Gone! they went hence so soon as they were born:
4612	And so I am awake. Poor wretches that depend
4613	On greatness' favour dream as I have done,
4614	Wake and find nothing. But, alas, I swerve:
4615	Many dream not to find, neither deserve,
4616	And yet are steep'd in favours: so am I,
4617	That have this golden chance and know not why.
4618	What fairies haunt this ground? A book? O rare one!
4619	Be not, as is our fangled world, a garment
4620	Nobler than that it covers: let thy effects
4621	So follow, to be most unlike our courtiers,
4622	As good as promise.
4623	
4624	[Reads]
4625	
4626	'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself unknown,
4627	without seeking find, and be embraced by a piece of
4628	tender air; and when from a stately cedar shall be
4629	lopped branches, which, being dead many years,
4630	shall after revive, be jointed to the old stock and
4631	freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end his miseries,
4632	Britain be fortunate and flourish in peace and plenty.'
4633	'Tis still a dream, or else such stuff as madmen
4634	Tongue and brain not; either both or nothing;
4635	Or senseless speaking or a speaking such
4636	As sense cannot untie. Be what it is,
4637	The action of my life is like it, which
4638	I'll keep, if but for sympathy.
4639	
4640	[Re-enter First Gaoler]
4641	
4642	First Gaoler	Come, sir, are you ready for death?
4643	
4644	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Over-roasted rather; ready long ago.
4645	
4646	First Gaoler	Hanging is the word, sir: if
4647	you be ready for that, you are well cooked.
4648	
4649	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	So, if I prove a good repast to the
4650	spectators, the dish pays the shot.
4651	
4652	First Gaoler	A heavy reckoning for you, sir. But the comfort is,
4653	you shall be called to no more payments, fear no
4654	more tavern-bills; which are often the sadness of
4655	parting, as the procuring of mirth: you come in
4656	flint for want of meat, depart reeling with too
4657	much drink; sorry that you have paid too much, and
4658	sorry that you are paid too much; purse and brain
4659	both empty; the brain the heavier for being too
4660	light, the purse too light, being drawn of
4661	heaviness: of this contradiction you shall now be
4662	quit. O, the charity of a penny cord! It sums up
4663	thousands in a trice: you have no true debitor and
4664	creditor but it; of what's past, is, and to come,
4665	the discharge: your neck, sir, is pen, book and
4666	counters; so the acquittance follows.
4667	
4668	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I am merrier to die than thou art to live.
4669	
4670	First Gaoler	Indeed, sir, he that sleeps feels not the
4671	tooth-ache: but a man that were to sleep your
4672	sleep, and a hangman to help him to bed, I think he
4673	would change places with his officer; for, look you,
4674	sir, you know not which way you shall go.
4675	
4676	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Yes, indeed do I, fellow.
4677	
4678	First Gaoler	Your death has eyes in 's head then; I have not seen
4679	him so pictured: you must either be directed by
4680	some that take upon them to know, or do take upon
4681	yourself that which I am sure you do not know, or
4682	jump the after inquiry on your own peril: and how
4683	you shall speed in your journey's end, I think you'll
4684	never return to tell one.
4685	
4686	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I tell thee, fellow, there are none want eyes to
4687	direct them the way I am going, but such as wink and
4688	will not use them.
4689	
4690	First Gaoler	What an infinite mock is this, that a man should
4691	have the best use of eyes to see the way of
4692	blindness! I am sure hanging's the way of winking.
4693	
4694	[Enter a Messenger]
4695	
4696	Messenger	Knock off his manacles; bring your prisoner to the king.
4697	
4698	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Thou bring'st good news; I am called to be made free.
4699	
4700	First Gaoler	I'll be hang'd then.
4701	
4702	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Thou shalt be then freer than a gaoler; no bolts for the dead.
4703	
4704	[Exeunt POSTHUMUS LEONATUS and Messenger]
4705	
4706	First Gaoler	Unless a man would marry a gallows and beget young
4707	gibbets, I never saw one so prone. Yet, on my
4708	conscience, there are verier knaves desire to live,
4709	for all he be a Roman: and there be some of them
4710	too that die against their wills; so should I, if I
4711	were one. I would we were all of one mind, and one
4712	mind good; O, there were desolation of gaolers and
4713	gallowses! I speak against my present profit, but
4714	my wish hath a preferment in 't.

4732	PISANIO, Lords, Officers, and Attendants]
4733	
4734	CYMBELINE	Stand by my side, you whom the gods have made
4735	Preservers of my throne. Woe is my heart
4736	That the poor soldier that so richly fought,
4737	Whose rags shamed gilded arms, whose naked breast
4738	Stepp'd before larges of proof, cannot be found:
4739	He shall be happy that can find him, if
4740	Our grace can make him so.
4741	
4742	BELARIUS	I never saw
4743	Such noble fury in so poor a thing;
4744	Such precious deeds in one that promises nought
4745	But beggary and poor looks.

4747	CYMBELINE	No tidings of him?
4748	
4749	PISANIO	He hath been search'd among the dead and living,
4750	But no trace of him.
4751	
4752	CYMBELINE	To my grief, I am
4753	The heir of his reward;
4754	
4755	[To BELARIUS, GUIDERIUS, and ARVIRAGUS]
4756	
4757	which I will add
4758	To you, the liver, heart and brain of Britain,
4759	By whom I grant she lives. 'Tis now the time
4760	To ask of whence you are. Report it.
4761	
4762	BELARIUS	Sir,
4763	In Cambria are we born, and gentlemen:
4764	Further to boast were neither true nor modest,
4765	Unless I add, we are honest.
4766	
4767	CYMBELINE	Bow your knees.
4768	Arise my knights o' the battle: I create you
4769	Companions to our person and will fit you
4770	With dignities becoming your estates.
4771	
4772	[Enter CORNELIUS and Ladies]
4773	
4774	There's business in these faces. Why so sadly
4775	Greet you our victory? you look like Romans,
4776	And not o' the court of Britain.
4777	
4778	CORNELIUS	Hail, great king!
4779	To sour your happiness, I must report
4780	The queen is dead.
4781	
4782	CYMBELINE	Who worse than a physician
4783	Would this report become? But I consider,
4784	By medicine life may be prolong'd, yet death
4785	Will seize the doctor too. How ended she?
4786	
4787	CORNELIUS	With horror, madly dying, like her life,
4788	Which, being cruel to the world, concluded
4789	Most cruel to herself. What she confess'd
4790	I will report, so please you: these her women
4791	Can trip me, if I err; who with wet cheeks
4792	Were present when she finish'd.
4793	
4794	CYMBELINE	Prithee, say.
4795	
4796	CORNELIUS	First, she confess'd she never loved you, only
4797	Affected greatness got by you, not you:
4798	Married your royalty, was wife to your place;
4799	Abhorr'd your person.
4800	
4801	CYMBELINE	She alone knew this;
4802	And, but she spoke it dying, I would not
4803	Believe her lips in opening it. Proceed.
4804	
4805	CORNELIUS	Your daughter, whom she bore in hand to love
4806	With such integrity, she did confess
4807	Was as a scorpion to her sight; whose life,
4808	But that her flight prevented it, she had
4809	Ta'en off by poison.
4810	
4811	CYMBELINE	O most delicate fiend!
4812	Who is 't can read a woman? Is there more?
4813	
4814	CORNELIUS	More, sir, and worse. She did confess she had
4815	For you a mortal mineral; which, being took,
4816	Should by the minute feed on life and lingering
4817	By inches waste you: in which time she purposed,
4818	By watching, weeping, tendance, kissing, to
4819	O'ercome you with her show, and in time,
4820	When she had fitted you with her craft, to work
4821	Her son into the adoption of the crown:
4822	But, failing of her end by his strange absence,
4823	Grew shameless-desperate; open'd, in despite
4824	Of heaven and men, her purposes; repented
4825	The evils she hatch'd were not effected; so
4826	Despairing died.
4827	
4828	CYMBELINE	                  Heard you all this, her women?
4829	
4830	First Lady	We did, so please your highness.
4831	
4832	CYMBELINE	Mine eyes
4833	Were not in fault, for she was beautiful;
4834	Mine ears, that heard her flattery; nor my heart,
4835	That thought her like her seeming; it had
4836	been vicious
4837	To have mistrusted her: yet, O my daughter!
4838	That it was folly in me, thou mayst say,
4839	And prove it in thy feeling. Heaven mend all!
4840	
4841	[Enter LUCIUS, IACHIMO, the Soothsayer, and other
4842	Roman Prisoners, guarded; POSTHUMUS LEONATUS
4843	behind, and IMOGEN]
4844	
4845	Thou comest not, Caius, now for tribute that
4846	The Britons have razed out, though with the loss
4847	Of many a bold one; whose kinsmen have made suit
4848	That their good souls may be appeased with slaughter
4849	Of you their captives, which ourself have granted:
4850	So think of your estate.
4851	
4852	CAIUS LUCIUS	Consider, sir, the chance of war: the day
4853	Was yours by accident; had it gone with us,
4854	We should not, when the blood was cool,
4855	have threaten'd
4856	Our prisoners with the sword. But since the gods
4857	Will have it thus, that nothing but our lives
4858	May be call'd ransom, let it come: sufficeth
4859	A Roman with a Roman's heart can suffer:
4860	Augustus lives to think on't: and so much
4861	For my peculiar care. This one thing only
4862	I will entreat; my boy, a Briton born,
4863	Let him be ransom'd: never master had
4864	A page so kind, so duteous, diligent,
4865	So tender over his occasions, true,
4866	So feat, so nurse-like: let his virtue join
4867	With my request, which I make bold your highness
4868	Cannot deny; he hath done no Briton harm,
4869	Though he have served a Roman: save him, sir,
4870	And spare no blood beside.
4871	
4872	CYMBELINE	I have surely seen him:
4873	His favour is familiar to me. Boy,
4874	Thou hast look'd thyself into my grace,
4875	And art mine own. I know not why, wherefore,
4876	To say 'live, boy:' ne'er thank thy master; live:
4877	And ask of Cymbeline what boon thou wilt,
4878	Fitting my bounty and thy state, I'll give it;
4879	Yea, though thou do demand a prisoner,
4880	The noblest ta'en.
4881	
4882	IMOGEN	                  I humbly thank your highness.
4883	
4884	CAIUS LUCIUS	I do not bid thee beg my life, good lad;
4885	And yet I know thou wilt.
4886	
4887	IMOGEN	No, no: alack,
4888	There's other work in hand: I see a thing
4889	Bitter to me as death: your life, good master,
4890	Must shuffle for itself.
4891	
4892	CAIUS LUCIUS	The boy disdains me,
4893	He leaves me, scorns me: briefly die their joys
4894	That place them on the truth of girls and boys.
4895	Why stands he so perplex'd?
4896	
4897	CYMBELINE	What wouldst thou, boy?
4898	I love thee more and more: think more and more
4899	What's best to ask. Know'st him thou look'st on? speak,
4900	Wilt have him live? Is he thy kin? thy friend?
4901	
4902	IMOGEN	He is a Roman; no more kin to me
4903	Than I to your highness; who, being born your vassal,
4904	Am something nearer.
4905	
4906	CYMBELINE	Wherefore eyest him so?
4907	
4908	IMOGEN	I'll tell you, sir, in private, if you please
4909	To give me hearing.
4910	
4911	CYMBELINE	Ay, with all my heart,
4912	And lend my best attention. What's thy name?
4913	
4914	IMOGEN	Fidele, sir.
4915	
4916	CYMBELINE	                  Thou'rt my good youth, my page;
4917	I'll be thy master: walk with me; speak freely.
4918	
4919	[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN converse apart]
4920	
4921	BELARIUS	Is not this boy revived from death?
4922	
4923	ARVIRAGUS	One sand another
4924	Not more resembles that sweet rosy lad
4925	Who died, and was Fidele. What think you?
4926	
4927	GUIDERIUS	The same dead thing alive.
4928	
4929	BELARIUS	Peace, peace! see further; he eyes us not; forbear;
4930	Creatures may be alike: were 't he, I am sure
4931	He would have spoke to us.
4932	
4933	GUIDERIUS	But we saw him dead.
4934	
4935	BELARIUS	Be silent; let's see further.
4936	
4937	PISANIO	[Aside]	It is my mistress:
4938	Since she is living, let the time run on
4939	To good or bad.
4940	
4941	[CYMBELINE and IMOGEN come forward]
4942	
4943	CYMBELINE	                  Come, stand thou by our side;
4944	Make thy demand aloud.
4945	
4946	[To IACHIMO]
4947	Sir, step you forth;
4948	Give answer to this boy, and do it freely;
4949	Or, by our greatness and the grace of it,
4950	Which is our honour, bitter torture shall
4951	Winnow the truth from falsehood. On, speak to him.
4952	
4953	IMOGEN	My boon is, that this gentleman may render
4954	Of whom he had this ring.
4955	
4956	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	[Aside]                 What's that to him?
4957	
4958	CYMBELINE	That diamond upon your finger, say
4959	How came it yours?
4960	
4961	IACHIMO	Thou'lt torture me to leave unspoken that
4962	Which, to be spoke, would torture thee.
4963	
4964	CYMBELINE	How! me?
4965	
4966	IACHIMO	I am glad to be constrain'd to utter that
4967	Which torments me to conceal. By villany
4968	I got this ring: 'twas Leonatus' jewel;
4969	Whom thou didst banish; and--which more may
4970	grieve thee,
4971	As it doth me--a nobler sir ne'er lived
4972	'Twixt sky and ground. Wilt thou hear more, my lord?
4973	
4974	CYMBELINE	All that belongs to this.
4975	
4976	IACHIMO	That paragon, thy daughter,--
4977	For whom my heart drops blood, and my false spirits
4978	Quail to remember--Give me leave; I faint.
4979	
4980	CYMBELINE	My daughter! what of her? Renew thy strength:
4981	I had rather thou shouldst live while nature will
4982	Than die ere I hear more: strive, man, and speak.
4983	
4984	IACHIMO	Upon a time,--unhappy was the clock
4985	That struck the hour!--it was in Rome,--accursed
4986	The mansion where!--'twas at a feast,--O, would
4987	Our viands had been poison'd, or at least
4988	Those which I heaved to head!--the good Posthumus--
4989	What should I say? he was too good to be
4990	Where ill men were; and was the best of all
4991	Amongst the rarest of good ones,--sitting sadly,
4992	Hearing us praise our loves of Italy
4993	For beauty that made barren the swell'd boast
4994	Of him that best could speak, for feature, laming
4995	The shrine of Venus, or straight-pight Minerva.
4996	Postures beyond brief nature, for condition,
4997	A shop of all the qualities that man
4998	Loves woman for, besides that hook of wiving,
4999	Fairness which strikes the eye--
5000	
5001	CYMBELINE	I stand on fire:
5002	Come to the matter.
5003	
5004	IACHIMO	All too soon I shall,
5005	Unless thou wouldst grieve quickly. This Posthumus,
5006	Most like a noble lord in love and one
5007	That had a royal lover, took his hint;
5008	And, not dispraising whom we praised,--therein
5009	He was as calm as virtue--he began
5010	His mistress' picture; which by his tongue
5011	being made,
5012	And then a mind put in't, either our brags
5013	Were crack'd of kitchen-trolls, or his description
5014	Proved us unspeaking sots.
5015	
5016	CYMBELINE	Nay, nay, to the purpose.
5017	
5018	IACHIMO	Your daughter's chastity--there it begins.
5019	He spake of her, as Dian had hot dreams,
5020	And she alone were cold: whereat I, wretch,
5021	Made scruple of his praise; and wager'd with him
5022	Pieces of gold 'gainst this which then he wore
5023	Upon his honour'd finger, to attain
5024	In suit the place of's bed and win this ring
5025	By hers and mine adultery. He, true knight,
5026	No lesser of her honour confident
5027	Than I did truly find her, stakes this ring;
5028	And would so, had it been a carbuncle
5029	Of Phoebus' wheel, and might so safely, had it
5030	Been all the worth of's car. Away to Britain
5031	Post I in this design: well may you, sir,
5032	Remember me at court; where I was taught
5033	Of your chaste daughter the wide difference
5034	'Twixt amorous and villanous. Being thus quench'd
5035	Of hope, not longing, mine Italian brain
5036	'Gan in your duller Britain operate
5037	Most vilely; for my vantage, excellent:
5038	And, to be brief, my practise so prevail'd,
5039	That I return'd with simular proof enough
5040	To make the noble Leonatus mad,
5041	By wounding his belief in her renown
5042	With tokens thus, and thus; averting notes
5043	Of chamber-hanging, pictures, this her bracelet,--
5044	O cunning, how I got it!--nay, some marks
5045	Of secret on her person, that he could not
5046	But think her bond of chastity quite crack'd,
5047	I having ta'en the forfeit. Whereupon--
5048	Methinks, I see him now--
5049	
5050	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	[Advancing]             Ay, so thou dost,
5051	Italian fiend! Ay me, most credulous fool,
5052	Egregious murderer, thief, any thing
5053	That's due to all the villains past, in being,
5054	To come! O, give me cord, or knife, or poison,
5055	Some upright justicer! Thou, king, send out
5056	For torturers ingenious: it is I
5057	That all the abhorred things o' the earth amend
5058	By being worse than they. I am Posthumus,
5059	That kill'd thy daughter:--villain-like, I lie--
5060	That caused a lesser villain than myself,
5061	A sacrilegious thief, to do't: the temple
5062	Of virtue was she; yea, and she herself.
5063	Spit, and throw stones, cast mire upon me, set
5064	The dogs o' the street to bay me: every villain
5065	Be call'd Posthumus Leonitus; and
5066	Be villany less than 'twas! O Imogen!
5067	My queen, my life, my wife! O Imogen,
5068	Imogen, Imogen!
5069	
5070	IMOGEN	                  Peace, my lord; hear, hear--
5071	
5072	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Shall's have a play of this? Thou scornful page,
5073	There lie thy part.
5074	
5075	[Striking her: she falls]
5076	
5077	PISANIO	O, gentlemen, help!
5078	Mine and your mistress! O, my lord Posthumus!
5079	You ne'er kill'd Imogen til now. Help, help!
5080	Mine honour'd lady!
5081	
5082	CYMBELINE	Does the world go round?
5083	
5084	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	How come these staggers on me?
5085	
5086	PISANIO	Wake, my mistress!
5087	
5088	CYMBELINE	If this be so, the gods do mean to strike me
5089	To death with mortal joy.
5090	
5091	PISANIO	How fares thy mistress?
5092	
5093	IMOGEN	O, get thee from my sight;
5094	Thou gavest me poison: dangerous fellow, hence!
5095	Breathe not where princes are.
5096	
5097	CYMBELINE	The tune of Imogen!
5098	
5099	PISANIO	Lady,
5100	The gods throw stones of sulphur on me, if
5101	That box I gave you was not thought by me
5102	A precious thing: I had it from the queen.
5103	
5104	CYMBELINE	New matter still?
5105	
5106	IMOGEN	                  It poison'd me.
5107	
5108	CORNELIUS	O gods!
5109	I left out one thing which the queen confess'd.
5110	Which must approve thee honest: 'If Pisanio
5111	Have,' said she, 'given his mistress that confection
5112	Which I gave him for cordial, she is served
5113	As I would serve a rat.'
5114	
5115	CYMBELINE	What's this, Comelius?
5116	
5117	CORNELIUS	The queen, sir, very oft importuned me
5118	To temper poisons for her, still pretending
5119	The satisfaction of her knowledge only
5120	In killing creatures vile, as cats and dogs,
5121	Of no esteem: I, dreading that her purpose
5122	Was of more danger, did compound for her
5123	A certain stuff, which, being ta'en, would cease
5124	The present power of life, but in short time
5125	All offices of nature should again
5126	Do their due functions. Have you ta'en of it?
5127	
5128	IMOGEN	Most like I did, for I was dead.
5129	
5130	BELARIUS	My boys,
5131	There was our error.
5132	
5133	GUIDERIUS	This is, sure, Fidele.
5134	
5135	IMOGEN	Why did you throw your wedded lady from you?
5136	Think that you are upon a rock; and now
5137	Throw me again.
5138	
5139	[Embracing him]
5140	
5141	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Hang there like a fruit, my soul,
5142	Till the tree die!
5143	
5144	CYMBELINE	                  How now, my flesh, my child!
5145	What, makest thou me a dullard in this act?
5146	Wilt thou not speak to me?
5147	
5148	IMOGEN	[Kneeling]               Your blessing, sir.
5149	
5150	BELARIUS	[To GUIDERIUS and ARVIRAGUS]  Though you did love
5151	this youth, I blame ye not:
5152	You had a motive for't.
5153	
5154	CYMBELINE	My tears that fall
5155	Prove holy water on thee! Imogen,
5156	Thy mother's dead.
5157	
5158	IMOGEN	I am sorry for't, my lord.
5159	
5160	CYMBELINE	O, she was nought; and long of her it was
5161	That we meet here so strangely: but her son
5162	Is gone, we know not how nor where.
5163	
5164	PISANIO	My lord,
5165	Now fear is from me, I'll speak troth. Lord Cloten,
5166	Upon my lady's missing, came to me
5167	With his sword drawn; foam'd at the mouth, and swore,
5168	If I discover'd not which way she was gone,
5169	It was my instant death. By accident,
5170	had a feigned letter of my master's
5171	Then in my pocket; which directed him
5172	To seek her on the mountains near to Milford;
5173	Where, in a frenzy, in my master's garments,
5174	Which he enforced from me, away he posts
5175	With unchaste purpose and with oath to violate
5176	My lady's honour: what became of him
5177	I further know not.
5178	
5179	GUIDERIUS	Let me end the story:
5180	I slew him there.
5181	
5182	CYMBELINE	Marry, the gods forfend!
5183	I would not thy good deeds should from my lips
5184	Pluck a bard sentence: prithee, valiant youth,
5185	Deny't again.
5186	
5187	GUIDERIUS	                  I have spoke it, and I did it.
5188	
5189	CYMBELINE	He was a prince.
5190	
5191	GUIDERIUS	A most incivil one: the wrongs he did me
5192	Were nothing prince-like; for he did provoke me
5193	With language that would make me spurn the sea,
5194	If it could so roar to me: I cut off's head;
5195	And am right glad he is not standing here
5196	To tell this tale of mine.
5197	
5198	CYMBELINE	I am sorry for thee:
5199	By thine own tongue thou art condemn'd, and must
5200	Endure our law: thou'rt dead.
5201	
5202	IMOGEN	That headless man
5203	I thought had been my lord.
5204	
5205	CYMBELINE	Bind the offender,
5206	And take him from our presence.
5207	
5208	BELARIUS	Stay, sir king:
5209	This man is better than the man he slew,
5210	As well descended as thyself; and hath
5211	More of thee merited than a band of Clotens
5212	Had ever scar for.
5213	
5214	[To the Guard]
5215	
5216	Let his arms alone;
5217	They were not born for bondage.
5218	
5219	CYMBELINE	Why, old soldier,
5220	Wilt thou undo the worth thou art unpaid for,
5221	By tasting of our wrath? How of descent
5222	As good as we?
5223	
5224	ARVIRAGUS	                  In that he spake too far.
5225	
5226	CYMBELINE	And thou shalt die for't.
5227	
5228	BELARIUS	We will die all three:
5229	But I will prove that two on's are as good
5230	As I have given out him. My sons, I must,
5231	For mine own part, unfold a dangerous speech,
5232	Though, haply, well for you.
5233	
5234	ARVIRAGUS	Your danger's ours.
5235	
5236	GUIDERIUS	And our good his.
5237	
5238	BELARIUS	                  Have at it then, by leave.
5239	Thou hadst, great king, a subject who
5240	Was call'd Belarius.
5241	
5242	CYMBELINE	What of him? he is
5243	A banish'd traitor.
5244	
5245	BELARIUS	He it is that hath
5246	Assumed this age; indeed a banish'd man;
5247	I know not how a traitor.
5248	
5249	CYMBELINE	Take him hence:
5250	The whole world shall not save him.
5251	
5252	BELARIUS	Not too hot:
5253	First pay me for the nursing of thy sons;
5254	And let it be confiscate all, so soon
5255	As I have received it.
5256	
5257	CYMBELINE	Nursing of my sons!
5258	
5259	BELARIUS	I am too blunt and saucy: here's my knee:
5260	Ere I arise, I will prefer my sons;
5261	Then spare not the old father. Mighty sir,
5262	These two young gentlemen, that call me father
5263	And think they are my sons, are none of mine;
5264	They are the issue of your loins, my liege,
5265	And blood of your begetting.
5266	
5267	CYMBELINE	How! my issue!
5268	
5269	BELARIUS	So sure as you your father's. I, old Morgan,
5270	Am that Belarius whom you sometime banish'd:
5271	Your pleasure was my mere offence, my punishment
5272	Itself, and all my treason; that I suffer'd
5273	Was all the harm I did. These gentle princes--
5274	For such and so they are--these twenty years
5275	Have I train'd up: those arts they have as I
5276	Could put into them; my breeding was, sir, as
5277	Your highness knows. Their nurse, Euriphile,
5278	Whom for the theft I wedded, stole these children
5279	Upon my banishment: I moved her to't,
5280	Having received the punishment before,
5281	For that which I did then: beaten for loyalty
5282	Excited me to treason: their dear loss,
5283	The more of you 'twas felt, the more it shaped
5284	Unto my end of stealing them. But, gracious sir,
5285	Here are your sons again; and I must lose
5286	Two of the sweet'st companions in the world.
5287	The benediction of these covering heavens
5288	Fall on their heads like dew! for they are worthy
5289	To inlay heaven with stars.
5290	
5291	CYMBELINE	Thou weep'st, and speak'st.
5292	The service that you three have done is more
5293	Unlike than this thou tell'st. I lost my children:
5294	If these be they, I know not how to wish
5295	A pair of worthier sons.
5296	
5297	BELARIUS	Be pleased awhile.
5298	This gentleman, whom I call Polydore,
5299	Most worthy prince, as yours, is true Guiderius:
5300	This gentleman, my Cadwal, Arviragus,
5301	Your younger princely son; he, sir, was lapp'd
5302	In a most curious mantle, wrought by the hand
5303	Of his queen mother, which for more probation
5304	I can with ease produce.
5305	
5306	CYMBELINE	Guiderius had
5307	Upon his neck a mole, a sanguine star;
5308	It was a mark of wonder.
5309	
5310	BELARIUS	This is he;
5311	Who hath upon him still that natural stamp:
5312	It was wise nature's end in the donation,
5313	To be his evidence now.
5314	
5315	CYMBELINE	O, what, am I
5316	A mother to the birth of three? Ne'er mother
5317	Rejoiced deliverance more. Blest pray you be,
5318	That, after this strange starting from your orbs,
5319	may reign in them now! O Imogen,
5320	Thou hast lost by this a kingdom.
5321	
5322	IMOGEN	No, my lord;
5323	I have got two worlds by 't. O my gentle brothers,
5324	Have we thus met? O, never say hereafter
5325	But I am truest speaker you call'd me brother,
5326	When I was but your sister; I you brothers,
5327	When ye were so indeed.
5328	
5329	CYMBELINE	Did you e'er meet?
5330	
5331	ARVIRAGUS	Ay, my good lord.
5332	
5333	GUIDERIUS	                  And at first meeting loved;
5334	Continued so, until we thought he died.
5335	
5336	CORNELIUS	By the queen's dram she swallow'd.
5337	
5338	CYMBELINE	O rare instinct!
5339	When shall I hear all through? This fierce
5340	abridgement
5341	Hath to it circumstantial branches, which
5342	Distinction should be rich in. Where? how lived You?
5343	And when came you to serve our Roman captive?
5344	How parted with your brothers? how first met them?
5345	Why fled you from the court? and whither? These,
5346	And your three motives to the battle, with
5347	I know not how much more, should be demanded;
5348	And all the other by-dependencies,
5349	From chance to chance: but nor the time nor place
5350	Will serve our long inter'gatories. See,
5351	Posthumus anchors upon Imogen,
5352	And she, like harmless lightning, throws her eye
5353	On him, her brother, me, her master, hitting
5354	Each object with a joy: the counterchange
5355	Is severally in all. Let's quit this ground,
5356	And smoke the temple with our sacrifices.
5357	
5358	[To BELARIUS]
5359	
5360	Thou art my brother; so we'll hold thee ever.
5361	
5362	IMOGEN	You are my father too, and did relieve me,
5363	To see this gracious season.
5364	
5365	CYMBELINE	All o'erjoy'd,
5366	Save these in bonds: let them be joyful too,
5367	For they shall taste our comfort.
5368	
5369	IMOGEN	My good master,
5370	I will yet do you service.
5371	
5372	CAIUS LUCIUS	Happy be you!
5373	
5374	CYMBELINE	The forlorn soldier, that so nobly fought,
5375	He would have well becomed this place, and graced
5376	The thankings of a king.
5377	
5378	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	I am, sir,
5379	The soldier that did company these three
5380	In poor beseeming; 'twas a fitment for
5381	The purpose I then follow'd. That I was he,
5382	Speak, Iachimo: I had you down and might
5383	Have made you finish.
5384	
5385	IACHIMO	[Kneeling]          I am down again:
5386	But now my heavy conscience sinks my knee,
5387	As then your force did. Take that life, beseech you,
5388	Which I so often owe: but your ring first;
5389	And here the bracelet of the truest princess
5390	That ever swore her faith.
5391	
5392	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Kneel not to me:
5393	The power that I have on you is, to spare you;
5394	The malice towards you to forgive you: live,
5395	And deal with others better.
5396	
5397	CYMBELINE	Nobly doom'd!
5398	We'll learn our freeness of a son-in-law;
5399	Pardon's the word to all.
5400	
5401	ARVIRAGUS	You holp us, sir,
5402	As you did mean indeed to be our brother;
5403	Joy'd are we that you are.
5404	
5405	POSTHUMUS LEONATUS	Your servant, princes. Good my lord of Rome,
5406	Call forth your soothsayer: as I slept, methought
5407	Great Jupiter, upon his eagle back'd,
5408	Appear'd to me, with other spritely shows
5409	Of mine own kindred: when I waked, I found
5410	This label on my bosom; whose containing
5411	Is so from sense in hardness, that I can
5412	Make no collection of it: let him show
5413	His skill in the construction.
5414	
5415	CAIUS LUCIUS	Philarmonus!
5416	
5417	Soothsayer	Here, my good lord.
5418	
5419	CAIUS LUCIUS	Read, and declare the meaning.
5420	
5421	Soothsayer	[Reads]  'When as a lion's whelp shall, to himself
5422	unknown, without seeking find, and be embraced by a
5423	piece of tender air; and when from a stately cedar
5424	shall be lopped branches, which, being dead many
5425	years, shall after revive, be jointed to the old
5426	stock, and freshly grow; then shall Posthumus end
5427	his miseries, Britain be fortunate and flourish in
5428	peace and plenty.'
5429	Thou, Leonatus, art the lion's whelp;
5430	The fit and apt construction of thy name,
5431	Being Leonatus, doth import so much.
5432	
5433	[To CYMBELINE]
5434	
5435	The piece of tender air, thy virtuous daughter,
5436	Which we call 'mollis aer;' and 'mollis aer'
5437	We term it 'mulier:' which 'mulier' I divine
5438	Is this most constant wife; who, even now,
5439	Answering the letter of the oracle,
5440	Unknown to you, unsought, were clipp'd about
5441	With this most tender air.
5442	
5443	CYMBELINE	This hath some seeming.
5444	
5445	Soothsayer	The lofty cedar, royal Cymbeline,
5446	Personates thee: and thy lopp'd branches point
5447	Thy two sons forth; who, by Belarius stol'n,
5448	For many years thought dead, are now revived,
5449	To the majestic cedar join'd, whose issue
5450	Promises Britain peace and plenty.
5451	
5452	CYMBELINE	Well
5453	My peace we will begin. And, Caius Lucius,
5454	Although the victor, we submit to Caesar,
5455	And to the Roman empire; promising
5456	To pay our wonted tribute, from the which
5457	We were dissuaded by our wicked queen;
5458	Whom heavens, in justice, both on her and hers,
5459	Have laid most heavy hand.
5460	
5461	Soothsayer	The fingers of the powers above do tune
5462	The harmony of this peace. The vision
5463	Which I made known to Lucius, ere the stroke
5464	Of this yet scarce-cold battle, at this instant
5465	Is full accomplish'd; for the Roman eagle,
5466	From south to west on wing soaring aloft,
5467	Lessen'd herself, and in the beams o' the sun
5468	So vanish'd: which foreshow'd our princely eagle,
5469	The imperial Caesar, should again unite
5470	His favour with the radiant Cymbeline,
5471	Which shines here in the west.
5472	
5473	CYMBELINE	Laud we the gods;
5474	And let our crooked smokes climb to their nostrils
5475	From our blest altars. Publish we this peace
5476	To all our subjects. Set we forward: let
5477	A Roman and a British ensign wave
5478	Friendly together: so through Lud's-town march:
5479	And in the temple of great Jupiter
5480	Our peace we'll ratify; seal it with feasts.
5481	Set on there! Never was a war did cease,
5482	Ere bloody hands were wash'd, with such a peace.
5483	
5484	[Exeunt]

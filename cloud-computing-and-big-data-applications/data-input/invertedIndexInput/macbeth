131	
132	
133	[Alarum within. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN,
134	LENNOX, with Attendants, meeting a bleeding Sergeant]
135	
136	DUNCAN	What bloody man is that? He can report,
137	As seemeth by his plight, of the revolt
138	The newest state.
139	
140	MALCOLM	                  This is the sergeant
141	Who like a good and hardy soldier fought
142	'Gainst my captivity. Hail, brave friend!
143	Say to the king the knowledge of the broil
144	As thou didst leave it.
145	
146	Sergeant	Doubtful it stood;
147	As two spent swimmers, that do cling together
148	And choke their art. The merciless Macdonwald--
149	Worthy to be a rebel, for to that
150	The multiplying villanies of nature
151	Do swarm upon him--from the western isles
152	Of kerns and gallowglasses is supplied;
153	And fortune, on his damned quarrel smiling,
154	Show'd like a rebel's whore: but all's too weak:
155	For brave Macbeth--well he deserves that name--
156	Disdaining fortune, with his brandish'd steel,
157	Which smoked with bloody execution,
158	Like valour's minion carved out his passage
159	Till he faced the slave;
160	Which ne'er shook hands, nor bade farewell to him,
161	Till he unseam'd him from the nave to the chaps,
162	And fix'd his head upon our battlements.
163	
164	DUNCAN	O valiant cousin! worthy gentleman!
165	
166	Sergeant	As whence the sun 'gins his reflection
167	Shipwrecking storms and direful thunders break,
168	So from that spring whence comfort seem'd to come
169	Discomfort swells. Mark, king of Scotland, mark:
170	No sooner justice had with valour arm'd
171	Compell'd these skipping kerns to trust their heels,
172	But the Norweyan lord surveying vantage,
173	With furbish'd arms and new supplies of men
174	Began a fresh assault.
175	
176	DUNCAN	Dismay'd not this
177	Our captains, Macbeth and Banquo?
178	
179	Sergeant	Yes;
180	As sparrows eagles, or the hare the lion.
181	If I say sooth, I must report they were
182	As cannons overcharged with double cracks, so they
183	Doubly redoubled strokes upon the foe:
184	Except they meant to bathe in reeking wounds,
185	Or memorise another Golgotha,
186	I cannot tell.
187	But I am faint, my gashes cry for help.
188	
189	DUNCAN	So well thy words become thee as thy wounds;
190	They smack of honour both. Go get him surgeons.
191	
192	[Exit Sergeant, attended]
193	
194	Who comes here?
195	
196	[Enter ROSS]
197	
198	MALCOLM	                  The worthy thane of Ross.
199	
200	LENNOX	What a haste looks through his eyes! So should he look
201	That seems to speak things strange.
202	
203	ROSS	God save the king!
204	
205	DUNCAN	Whence camest thou, worthy thane?
206	
207	ROSS	From Fife, great king;
208	Where the Norweyan banners flout the sky
209	And fan our people cold. Norway himself,
210	With terrible numbers,
211	Assisted by that most disloyal traitor
212	The thane of Cawdor, began a dismal conflict;
213	Till that Bellona's bridegroom, lapp'd in proof,
214	Confronted him with self-comparisons,
215	Point against point rebellious, arm 'gainst arm.
216	Curbing his lavish spirit: and, to conclude,
217	The victory fell on us.
218	
219	DUNCAN	Great happiness!
220	
221	ROSS	That now
222	Sweno, the Norways' king, craves composition:
223	Nor would we deign him burial of his men
224	Till he disbursed at Saint Colme's inch
225	Ten thousand dollars to our general use.
226	
227	DUNCAN	No more that thane of Cawdor shall deceive
228	Our bosom interest: go pronounce his present death,
229	And with his former title greet Macbeth.
230	
231	ROSS	I'll see it done.
232	
233	DUNCAN	What he hath lost noble Macbeth hath won.

247	SCENE III	A heath near Forres.
248	
249	
250	[Thunder. Enter the three Witches]
251	
252	First Witch	Where hast thou been, sister?
253	
254	Second Witch	Killing swine.
255	
256	Third Witch	Sister, where thou?
257	
258	First Witch	A sailor's wife had chestnuts in her lap,
259	And munch'd, and munch'd, and munch'd:--
260	'Give me,' quoth I:
261	'Aroint thee, witch!' the rump-fed ronyon cries.
262	Her husband's to Aleppo gone, master o' the Tiger:
263	But in a sieve I'll thither sail,
264	And, like a rat without a tail,
265	I'll do, I'll do, and I'll do.
266	
267	Second Witch	I'll give thee a wind.
268	
269	First Witch	Thou'rt kind.
270	
271	Third Witch	And I another.
272	
273	First Witch	I myself have all the other,
274	And the very ports they blow,
275	All the quarters that they know
276	I' the shipman's card.
277	I will drain him dry as hay:
278	Sleep shall neither night nor day
279	Hang upon his pent-house lid;
280	He shall live a man forbid:
281	Weary se'nnights nine times nine
282	Shall he dwindle, peak and pine:
283	Though his bark cannot be lost,
284	Yet it shall be tempest-tost.
285	Look what I have.
286	
287	Second Witch	Show me, show me.
288	
289	First Witch	Here I have a pilot's thumb,
290	Wreck'd as homeward he did come.
291	
292	[Drum within]
293	
294	Third Witch	A drum, a drum!
295	Macbeth doth come.
296	
297	ALL	The weird sisters, hand in hand,
298	Posters of the sea and land,
299	Thus do go about, about:
300	Thrice to thine and thrice to mine
301	And thrice again, to make up nine.
302	Peace! the charm's wound up.
303	
304	[Enter MACBETH and BANQUO]
305	
306	MACBETH	So foul and fair a day I have not seen.
307	
308	BANQUO	How far is't call'd to Forres? What are these
309	So wither'd and so wild in their attire,
310	That look not like the inhabitants o' the earth,
311	And yet are on't? Live you? or are you aught
312	That man may question? You seem to understand me,
313	By each at once her chappy finger laying
314	Upon her skinny lips: you should be women,
315	And yet your beards forbid me to interpret
316	That you are so.
317	
318	MACBETH	                  Speak, if you can: what are you?
319	
320	First Witch	All hail, Macbeth! hail to thee, thane of Glamis!
321	
322	Second Witch	All hail, Macbeth, hail to thee, thane of Cawdor!
323	
324	Third Witch	All hail, Macbeth, thou shalt be king hereafter!
325	
326	BANQUO	Good sir, why do you start; and seem to fear
327	Things that do sound so fair? I' the name of truth,
328	Are ye fantastical, or that indeed
329	Which outwardly ye show? My noble partner
330	You greet with present grace and great prediction
331	Of noble having and of royal hope,
332	That he seems rapt withal: to me you speak not.
333	If you can look into the seeds of time,
334	And say which grain will grow and which will not,
335	Speak then to me, who neither beg nor fear
336	Your favours nor your hate.
337	
338	First Witch	Hail!
339	
340	Second Witch	Hail!
341	
342	Third Witch	Hail!
343	
344	First Witch	Lesser than Macbeth, and greater.
345	
346	Second Witch	Not so happy, yet much happier.
347	
348	Third Witch	Thou shalt get kings, though thou be none:
349	So all hail, Macbeth and Banquo!
350	
351	First Witch	Banquo and Macbeth, all hail!
352	
353	MACBETH	Stay, you imperfect speakers, tell me more:
354	By Sinel's death I know I am thane of Glamis;
355	But how of Cawdor? the thane of Cawdor lives,
356	A prosperous gentleman; and to be king
357	Stands not within the prospect of belief,
358	No more than to be Cawdor. Say from whence
359	You owe this strange intelligence? or why
360	Upon this blasted heath you stop our way
361	With such prophetic greeting? Speak, I charge you.
362	
363	[Witches vanish]
364	
365	BANQUO	The earth hath bubbles, as the water has,
366	And these are of them. Whither are they vanish'd?
367	
368	MACBETH	Into the air; and what seem'd corporal melted
369	As breath into the wind. Would they had stay'd!
370	
371	BANQUO	Were such things here as we do speak about?
372	Or have we eaten on the insane root
373	That takes the reason prisoner?
374	
375	MACBETH	Your children shall be kings.
376	
377	BANQUO	You shall be king.
378	
379	MACBETH	And thane of Cawdor too: went it not so?
380	
381	BANQUO	To the selfsame tune and words. Who's here?
382	
383	[Enter ROSS and ANGUS]
384	
385	ROSS	The king hath happily received, Macbeth,
386	The news of thy success; and when he reads
387	Thy personal venture in the rebels' fight,
388	His wonders and his praises do contend
389	Which should be thine or his: silenced with that,
390	In viewing o'er the rest o' the selfsame day,
391	He finds thee in the stout Norweyan ranks,
392	Nothing afeard of what thyself didst make,
393	Strange images of death. As thick as hail
394	Came post with post; and every one did bear
395	Thy praises in his kingdom's great defence,
396	And pour'd them down before him.
397	
398	ANGUS	We are sent
399	To give thee from our royal master thanks;
400	Only to herald thee into his sight,
401	Not pay thee.
402	
403	ROSS	And, for an earnest of a greater honour,
404	He bade me, from him, call thee thane of Cawdor:
405	In which addition, hail, most worthy thane!
406	For it is thine.
407	
408	BANQUO	                  What, can the devil speak true?
409	
410	MACBETH	The thane of Cawdor lives: why do you dress me
411	In borrow'd robes?
412	
413	ANGUS	                  Who was the thane lives yet;
414	But under heavy judgment bears that life
415	Which he deserves to lose. Whether he was combined
416	With those of Norway, or did line the rebel
417	With hidden help and vantage, or that with both
418	He labour'd in his country's wreck, I know not;
419	But treasons capital, confess'd and proved,
420	Have overthrown him.
421	
422	MACBETH	[Aside]  Glamis, and thane of Cawdor!
423	The greatest is behind.
424	
425	[To ROSS and ANGUS]
426	
427	Thanks for your pains.
428	
429	[To BANQUO]
430	
431	Do you not hope your children shall be kings,
432	When those that gave the thane of Cawdor to me
433	Promised no less to them?
434	
435	BANQUO	That trusted home
436	Might yet enkindle you unto the crown,
437	Besides the thane of Cawdor. But 'tis strange:
438	And oftentimes, to win us to our harm,
439	The instruments of darkness tell us truths,
440	Win us with honest trifles, to betray's
441	In deepest consequence.
442	Cousins, a word, I pray you.
443	
444	MACBETH	[Aside]	Two truths are told,
445	As happy prologues to the swelling act
446	Of the imperial theme.--I thank you, gentlemen.
447	
448	[Aside]  This supernatural soliciting
449	Cannot be ill, cannot be good: if ill,
450	Why hath it given me earnest of success,
451	Commencing in a truth? I am thane of Cawdor:
452	If good, why do I yield to that suggestion
453	Whose horrid image doth unfix my hair
454	And make my seated heart knock at my ribs,
455	Against the use of nature? Present fears
456	Are less than horrible imaginings:
457	My thought, whose murder yet is but fantastical,
458	Shakes so my single state of man that function
459	Is smother'd in surmise, and nothing is
460	But what is not.
461	
462	BANQUO	                  Look, how our partner's rapt.
463	
464	MACBETH	[Aside]  If chance will have me king, why, chance may crown me,
465	Without my stir.
466	
467	BANQUO	                  New horrors come upon him,
468	Like our strange garments, cleave not to their mould
469	But with the aid of use.
470	
471	MACBETH	[Aside]                Come what come may,
472	Time and the hour runs through the roughest day.
473	
474	BANQUO	Worthy Macbeth, we stay upon your leisure.
475	
476	MACBETH	Give me your favour: my dull brain was wrought
477	With things forgotten. Kind gentlemen, your pains
478	Are register'd where every day I turn
479	The leaf to read them. Let us toward the king.
480	Think upon what hath chanced, and, at more time,
481	The interim having weigh'd it, let us speak
482	Our free hearts each to other.
483	
484	BANQUO	Very gladly.
485	
486	MACBETH	Till then, enough. Come, friends.

501	
502	
503	[Flourish. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM, DONALBAIN, LENNOX,
504	and Attendants]
505	
506	DUNCAN	Is execution done on Cawdor? Are not
507	Those in commission yet return'd?
508	
509	MALCOLM	My liege,
510	They are not yet come back. But I have spoke
511	With one that saw him die: who did report
512	That very frankly he confess'd his treasons,
513	Implored your highness' pardon and set forth
514	A deep repentance: nothing in his life
515	Became him like the leaving it; he died
516	As one that had been studied in his death
517	To throw away the dearest thing he owed,
518	As 'twere a careless trifle.
519	
520	DUNCAN	There's no art
521	To find the mind's construction in the face:
522	He was a gentleman on whom I built
523	An absolute trust.
524	
525	[Enter MACBETH, BANQUO, ROSS, and ANGUS]
526	
527	O worthiest cousin!
528	The sin of my ingratitude even now
529	Was heavy on me: thou art so far before
530	That swiftest wing of recompense is slow
531	To overtake thee. Would thou hadst less deserved,
532	That the proportion both of thanks and payment
533	Might have been mine! only I have left to say,
534	More is thy due than more than all can pay.
535	
536	MACBETH	The service and the loyalty I owe,
537	In doing it, pays itself. Your highness' part
538	Is to receive our duties; and our duties
539	Are to your throne and state children and servants,
540	Which do but what they should, by doing every thing
541	Safe toward your love and honour.
542	
543	DUNCAN	Welcome hither:
544	I have begun to plant thee, and will labour
545	To make thee full of growing. Noble Banquo,
546	That hast no less deserved, nor must be known
547	No less to have done so, let me enfold thee
548	And hold thee to my heart.
549	
550	BANQUO	There if I grow,
551	The harvest is your own.
552	
553	DUNCAN	My plenteous joys,
554	Wanton in fulness, seek to hide themselves
555	In drops of sorrow. Sons, kinsmen, thanes,
556	And you whose places are the nearest, know
557	We will establish our estate upon
558	Our eldest, Malcolm, whom we name hereafter
559	The Prince of Cumberland; which honour must
560	Not unaccompanied invest him only,
561	But signs of nobleness, like stars, shall shine
562	On all deservers. From hence to Inverness,
563	And bind us further to you.
564	
565	MACBETH	The rest is labour, which is not used for you:
566	I'll be myself the harbinger and make joyful
567	The hearing of my wife with your approach;
568	So humbly take my leave.
569	
570	DUNCAN	My worthy Cawdor!
571	
572	MACBETH	[Aside]  The Prince of Cumberland! that is a step
573	On which I must fall down, or else o'erleap,
574	For in my way it lies. Stars, hide your fires;
575	Let not light see my black and deep desires:
576	The eye wink at the hand; yet let that be,
577	Which the eye fears, when it is done, to see.
578	
579	[Exit]
580	
581	DUNCAN	True, worthy Banquo; he is full so valiant,
582	And in his commendations I am fed;
583	It is a banquet to me. Let's after him,
584	Whose care is gone before to bid us welcome:
585	It is a peerless kinsman.

602	[Enter LADY MACBETH, reading a letter]
603	
604	LADY MACBETH	'They met me in the day of success: and I have
605	learned by the perfectest report, they have more in
606	them than mortal knowledge. When I burned in desire
607	to question them further, they made themselves air,
608	into which they vanished. Whiles I stood rapt in
609	the wonder of it, came missives from the king, who
610	all-hailed me 'Thane of Cawdor;' by which title,
611	before, these weird sisters saluted me, and referred
612	me to the coming on of time, with 'Hail, king that
613	shalt be!' This have I thought good to deliver
614	thee, my dearest partner of greatness, that thou
615	mightst not lose the dues of rejoicing, by being
616	ignorant of what greatness is promised thee. Lay it
617	to thy heart, and farewell.'
618	Glamis thou art, and Cawdor; and shalt be
619	What thou art promised: yet do I fear thy nature;
620	It is too full o' the milk of human kindness
621	To catch the nearest way: thou wouldst be great;
622	Art not without ambition, but without
623	The illness should attend it: what thou wouldst highly,
624	That wouldst thou holily; wouldst not play false,
625	And yet wouldst wrongly win: thou'ldst have, great Glamis,
626	That which cries 'Thus thou must do, if thou have it;
627	And that which rather thou dost fear to do
628	Than wishest should be undone.' Hie thee hither,
629	That I may pour my spirits in thine ear;
630	And chastise with the valour of my tongue
631	All that impedes thee from the golden round,
632	Which fate and metaphysical aid doth seem
633	To have thee crown'd withal.
634	
635	[Enter a Messenger]
636	
637	What is your tidings?
638	
639	Messenger	The king comes here to-night.
640	
641	LADY MACBETH	Thou'rt mad to say it:
642	Is not thy master with him? who, were't so,
643	Would have inform'd for preparation.
644	
645	Messenger	So please you, it is true: our thane is coming:
646	One of my fellows had the speed of him,
647	Who, almost dead for breath, had scarcely more
648	Than would make up his message.
649	
650	LADY MACBETH	Give him tending;
651	He brings great news.
652	
653	[Exit Messenger]
654	
655	The raven himself is hoarse
656	That croaks the fatal entrance of Duncan
657	Under my battlements. Come, you spirits
658	That tend on mortal thoughts, unsex me here,
659	And fill me from the crown to the toe top-full
660	Of direst cruelty! make thick my blood;
661	Stop up the access and passage to remorse,
662	That no compunctious visitings of nature
663	Shake my fell purpose, nor keep peace between
664	The effect and it! Come to my woman's breasts,
665	And take my milk for gall, you murdering ministers,
666	Wherever in your sightless substances
667	You wait on nature's mischief! Come, thick night,
668	And pall thee in the dunnest smoke of hell,
669	That my keen knife see not the wound it makes,
670	Nor heaven peep through the blanket of the dark,
671	To cry 'Hold, hold!'
672	
673	[Enter MACBETH]
674	
675	Great Glamis! worthy Cawdor!
676	Greater than both, by the all-hail hereafter!
677	Thy letters have transported me beyond
678	This ignorant present, and I feel now
679	The future in the instant.
680	
681	MACBETH	My dearest love,
682	Duncan comes here to-night.
683	
684	LADY MACBETH	And when goes hence?
685	
686	MACBETH	To-morrow, as he purposes.
687	
688	LADY MACBETH	O, never
689	Shall sun that morrow see!
690	Your face, my thane, is as a book where men
691	May read strange matters. To beguile the time,
692	Look like the time; bear welcome in your eye,
693	Your hand, your tongue: look like the innocent flower,
694	But be the serpent under't. He that's coming
695	Must be provided for: and you shall put
696	This night's great business into my dispatch;
697	Which shall to all our nights and days to come
698	Give solely sovereign sway and masterdom.
699	
700	MACBETH	We will speak further.
701	
702	LADY MACBETH	Only look up clear;
703	To alter favour ever is to fear:
704	Leave all the rest to me.

718	SCENE VI	Before Macbeth's castle.
719	
720	
721	[Hautboys and torches. Enter DUNCAN, MALCOLM,
722	DONALBAIN, BANQUO, LENNOX, MACDUFF, ROSS, ANGUS,
723	and Attendants]
724	
725	DUNCAN	This castle hath a pleasant seat; the air
726	Nimbly and sweetly recommends itself
727	Unto our gentle senses.
728	
729	BANQUO	This guest of summer,
730	The temple-haunting martlet, does approve,
731	By his loved mansionry, that the heaven's breath
732	Smells wooingly here: no jutty, frieze,
733	Buttress, nor coign of vantage, but this bird
734	Hath made his pendent bed and procreant cradle:
735	Where they most breed and haunt, I have observed,
736	The air is delicate.
737	
738	[Enter LADY MACBETH]
739	
740	DUNCAN	See, see, our honour'd hostess!
741	The love that follows us sometime is our trouble,
742	Which still we thank as love. Herein I teach you
743	How you shall bid God 'ild us for your pains,
744	And thank us for your trouble.
745	
746	LADY MACBETH	All our service
747	In every point twice done and then done double
748	Were poor and single business to contend
749	Against those honours deep and broad wherewith
750	Your majesty loads our house: for those of old,
751	And the late dignities heap'd up to them,
752	We rest your hermits.
753	
754	DUNCAN	Where's the thane of Cawdor?
755	We coursed him at the heels, and had a purpose
756	To be his purveyor: but he rides well;
757	And his great love, sharp as his spur, hath holp him
758	To his home before us. Fair and noble hostess,
759	We are your guest to-night.
760	
761	LADY MACBETH	Your servants ever
762	Have theirs, themselves and what is theirs, in compt,
763	To make their audit at your highness' pleasure,
764	Still to return your own.
765	
766	DUNCAN	Give me your hand;
767	Conduct me to mine host: we love him highly,
768	And shall continue our graces towards him.
769	By your leave, hostess.

783	SCENE VII	Macbeth's castle.
784	
785	
786	[Hautboys and torches. Enter a Sewer, and divers
787	Servants with dishes and service, and pass over the
788	stage. Then enter MACBETH]
789	
790	MACBETH	If it were done when 'tis done, then 'twere well
791	It were done quickly: if the assassination
792	Could trammel up the consequence, and catch
793	With his surcease success; that but this blow
794	Might be the be-all and the end-all here,
795	But here, upon this bank and shoal of time,
796	We'ld jump the life to come. But in these cases
797	We still have judgment here; that we but teach
798	Bloody instructions, which, being taught, return
799	To plague the inventor: this even-handed justice
800	Commends the ingredients of our poison'd chalice
801	To our own lips. He's here in double trust;
802	First, as I am his kinsman and his subject,
803	Strong both against the deed; then, as his host,
804	Who should against his murderer shut the door,
805	Not bear the knife myself. Besides, this Duncan
806	Hath borne his faculties so meek, hath been
807	So clear in his great office, that his virtues
808	Will plead like angels, trumpet-tongued, against
809	The deep damnation of his taking-off;
810	And pity, like a naked new-born babe,
811	Striding the blast, or heaven's cherubim, horsed
812	Upon the sightless couriers of the air,
813	Shall blow the horrid deed in every eye,
814	That tears shall drown the wind. I have no spur
815	To prick the sides of my intent, but only
816	Vaulting ambition, which o'erleaps itself
817	And falls on the other.
818	
819	[Enter LADY MACBETH]
820	
821	How now! what news?
822	
823	LADY MACBETH	He has almost supp'd: why have you left the chamber?
824	
825	MACBETH	Hath he ask'd for me?
826	
827	LADY MACBETH	Know you not he has?
828	
829	MACBETH	We will proceed no further in this business:
830	He hath honour'd me of late; and I have bought
831	Golden opinions from all sorts of people,
832	Which would be worn now in their newest gloss,
833	Not cast aside so soon.
834	
835	LADY MACBETH	Was the hope drunk
836	Wherein you dress'd yourself? hath it slept since?
837	And wakes it now, to look so green and pale
838	At what it did so freely? From this time
839	Such I account thy love. Art thou afeard
840	To be the same in thine own act and valour
841	As thou art in desire? Wouldst thou have that
842	Which thou esteem'st the ornament of life,
843	And live a coward in thine own esteem,
844	Letting 'I dare not' wait upon 'I would,'
845	Like the poor cat i' the adage?
846	
847	MACBETH	Prithee, peace:
848	I dare do all that may become a man;
849	Who dares do more is none.
850	LADY MACBETH	What beast was't, then,
851	That made you break this enterprise to me?
852	When you durst do it, then you were a man;
853	And, to be more than what you were, you would
854	Be so much more the man. Nor time nor place
855	Did then adhere, and yet you would make both:
856	They have made themselves, and that their fitness now
857	Does unmake you. I have given suck, and know
858	How tender 'tis to love the babe that milks me:
859	I would, while it was smiling in my face,
860	Have pluck'd my nipple from his boneless gums,
861	And dash'd the brains out, had I so sworn as you
862	Have done to this.
863	
864	MACBETH	                  If we should fail?
865	
866	LADY MACBETH	We fail!
867	But screw your courage to the sticking-place,
868	And we'll not fail. When Duncan is asleep--
869	Whereto the rather shall his day's hard journey
870	Soundly invite him--his two chamberlains
871	Will I with wine and wassail so convince
872	That memory, the warder of the brain,
873	Shall be a fume, and the receipt of reason
874	A limbeck only: when in swinish sleep
875	Their drenched natures lie as in a death,
876	What cannot you and I perform upon
877	The unguarded Duncan? what not put upon
878	His spongy officers, who shall bear the guilt
879	Of our great quell?
880	
881	MACBETH	Bring forth men-children only;
882	For thy undaunted mettle should compose
883	Nothing but males. Will it not be received,
884	When we have mark'd with blood those sleepy two
885	Of his own chamber and used their very daggers,
886	That they have done't?
887	
888	LADY MACBETH	Who dares receive it other,
889	As we shall make our griefs and clamour roar
890	Upon his death?
891	
892	MACBETH	                  I am settled, and bend up
893	Each corporal agent to this terrible feat.
894	Away, and mock the time with fairest show:
895	False face must hide what the false heart doth know.

911	
912	[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE bearing a torch before him]
913	
914	BANQUO	How goes the night, boy?
915	
916	FLEANCE	The moon is down; I have not heard the clock.
917	
918	BANQUO	And she goes down at twelve.
919	
920	FLEANCE	I take't, 'tis later, sir.
921	
922	BANQUO	Hold, take my sword. There's husbandry in heaven;
923	Their candles are all out. Take thee that too.
924	A heavy summons lies like lead upon me,
925	And yet I would not sleep: merciful powers,
926	Restrain in me the cursed thoughts that nature
927	Gives way to in repose!
928	
929	[Enter MACBETH, and a Servant with a torch]
930	
931	Give me my sword.
932	Who's there?
933	
934	MACBETH	A friend.
935	
936	BANQUO	What, sir, not yet at rest? The king's a-bed:
937	He hath been in unusual pleasure, and
938	Sent forth great largess to your offices.
939	This diamond he greets your wife withal,
940	By the name of most kind hostess; and shut up
941	In measureless content.
942	
943	MACBETH	Being unprepared,
944	Our will became the servant to defect;
945	Which else should free have wrought.
946	
947	BANQUO	All's well.
948	I dreamt last night of the three weird sisters:
949	To you they have show'd some truth.
950	
951	MACBETH	I think not of them:
952	Yet, when we can entreat an hour to serve,
953	We would spend it in some words upon that business,
954	If you would grant the time.
955	
956	BANQUO	At your kind'st leisure.
957	
958	MACBETH	If you shall cleave to my consent, when 'tis,
959	It shall make honour for you.
960	
961	BANQUO	So I lose none
962	In seeking to augment it, but still keep
963	My bosom franchised and allegiance clear,
964	I shall be counsell'd.
965	
966	MACBETH	Good repose the while!
967	
968	BANQUO	Thanks, sir: the like to you!
969	
970	[Exeunt BANQUO and FLEANCE]
971	
972	MACBETH	Go bid thy mistress, when my drink is ready,
973	She strike upon the bell. Get thee to bed.
974	
975	[Exit Servant]
976	
977	Is this a dagger which I see before me,
978	The handle toward my hand? Come, let me clutch thee.
979	I have thee not, and yet I see thee still.
980	Art thou not, fatal vision, sensible
981	To feeling as to sight? or art thou but
982	A dagger of the mind, a false creation,
983	Proceeding from the heat-oppressed brain?
984	I see thee yet, in form as palpable
985	As this which now I draw.
986	Thou marshall'st me the way that I was going;
987	And such an instrument I was to use.
988	Mine eyes are made the fools o' the other senses,
989	Or else worth all the rest; I see thee still,
990	And on thy blade and dudgeon gouts of blood,
991	Which was not so before. There's no such thing:
992	It is the bloody business which informs
993	Thus to mine eyes. Now o'er the one halfworld
994	Nature seems dead, and wicked dreams abuse
995	The curtain'd sleep; witchcraft celebrates
996	Pale Hecate's offerings, and wither'd murder,
997	Alarum'd by his sentinel, the wolf,
998	Whose howl's his watch, thus with his stealthy pace.
999	With Tarquin's ravishing strides, towards his design
1000	Moves like a ghost. Thou sure and firm-set earth,
1001	Hear not my steps, which way they walk, for fear
1002	Thy very stones prate of my whereabout,
1003	And take the present horror from the time,
1004	Which now suits with it. Whiles I threat, he lives:
1005	Words to the heat of deeds too cold breath gives.
1006	
1007	[A bell rings]
1008	
1009	I go, and it is done; the bell invites me.
1010	Hear it not, Duncan; for it is a knell
1011	That summons thee to heaven or to hell.

1026	
1027	
1028	[Enter LADY MACBETH]
1029	
1030	LADY MACBETH	That which hath made them drunk hath made me bold;
1031	What hath quench'd them hath given me fire.
1032	Hark! Peace!
1033	It was the owl that shriek'd, the fatal bellman,
1034	Which gives the stern'st good-night. He is about it:
1035	The doors are open; and the surfeited grooms
1036	Do mock their charge with snores: I have drugg'd
1037	their possets,
1038	That death and nature do contend about them,
1039	Whether they live or die.
1040	
1041	MACBETH	[Within]  Who's there? what, ho!
1042	
1043	LADY MACBETH	Alack, I am afraid they have awaked,
1044	And 'tis not done. The attempt and not the deed
1045	Confounds us. Hark! I laid their daggers ready;
1046	He could not miss 'em. Had he not resembled
1047	My father as he slept, I had done't.
1048	
1049	[Enter MACBETH]
1050	
1051	My husband!
1052	
1053	MACBETH	I have done the deed. Didst thou not hear a noise?
1054	
1055	LADY MACBETH	I heard the owl scream and the crickets cry.
1056	Did not you speak?
1057	
1058	MACBETH	                  When?
1059	
1060	LADY MACBETH	Now.
1061	
1062	MACBETH	As I descended?
1063	
1064	LADY MACBETH	Ay.
1065	
1066	MACBETH	Hark!
1067	Who lies i' the second chamber?
1068	
1069	LADY MACBETH	Donalbain.
1070	
1071	MACBETH	This is a sorry sight.
1072	
1073	[Looking on his hands]
1074	
1075	LADY MACBETH	A foolish thought, to say a sorry sight.
1076	
1077	MACBETH	There's one did laugh in's sleep, and one cried
1078	'Murder!'
1079	That they did wake each other: I stood and heard them:
1080	But they did say their prayers, and address'd them
1081	Again to sleep.
1082	
1083	LADY MACBETH	                  There are two lodged together.
1084	
1085	MACBETH	One cried 'God bless us!' and 'Amen' the other;
1086	As they had seen me with these hangman's hands.
1087	Listening their fear, I could not say 'Amen,'
1088	When they did say 'God bless us!'
1089	
1090	LADY MACBETH	Consider it not so deeply.
1091	
1092	MACBETH	But wherefore could not I pronounce 'Amen'?
1093	I had most need of blessing, and 'Amen'
1094	Stuck in my throat.
1095	
1096	LADY MACBETH	These deeds must not be thought
1097	After these ways; so, it will make us mad.
1098	
1099	MACBETH	Methought I heard a voice cry 'Sleep no more!
1100	Macbeth does murder sleep', the innocent sleep,
1101	Sleep that knits up the ravell'd sleeve of care,
1102	The death of each day's life, sore labour's bath,
1103	Balm of hurt minds, great nature's second course,
1104	Chief nourisher in life's feast,--
1105	
1106	LADY MACBETH	What do you mean?
1107	
1108	MACBETH	Still it cried 'Sleep no more!' to all the house:
1109	'Glamis hath murder'd sleep, and therefore Cawdor
1110	Shall sleep no more; Macbeth shall sleep no more.'
1111	
1112	LADY MACBETH	Who was it that thus cried? Why, worthy thane,
1113	You do unbend your noble strength, to think
1114	So brainsickly of things. Go get some water,
1115	And wash this filthy witness from your hand.
1116	Why did you bring these daggers from the place?
1117	They must lie there: go carry them; and smear
1118	The sleepy grooms with blood.
1119	
1120	MACBETH	I'll go no more:
1121	I am afraid to think what I have done;
1122	Look on't again I dare not.
1123	
1124	LADY MACBETH	Infirm of purpose!
1125	Give me the daggers: the sleeping and the dead
1126	Are but as pictures: 'tis the eye of childhood
1127	That fears a painted devil. If he do bleed,
1128	I'll gild the faces of the grooms withal;
1129	For it must seem their guilt.
1130	
1131	[Exit. Knocking within]
1132	
1133	MACBETH	Whence is that knocking?
1134	How is't with me, when every noise appals me?
1135	What hands are here? ha! they pluck out mine eyes.
1136	Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood
1137	Clean from my hand? No, this my hand will rather
1138	The multitudinous seas in incarnadine,
1139	Making the green one red.
1140	
1141	[Re-enter LADY MACBETH]
1142	
1143	LADY MACBETH	My hands are of your colour; but I shame
1144	To wear a heart so white.
1145	
1146	[Knocking within]
1147	
1148	I hear a knocking
1149	At the south entry: retire we to our chamber;
1150	A little water clears us of this deed:
1151	How easy is it, then! Your constancy
1152	Hath left you unattended.
1153	
1154	[Knocking within]
1155	
1156	Hark! more knocking.
1157	Get on your nightgown, lest occasion call us,
1158	And show us to be watchers. Be not lost
1159	So poorly in your thoughts.
1160	
1161	MACBETH	To know my deed, 'twere best not know myself.
1162	
1163	[Knocking within]

1183	Porter	Here's a knocking indeed! If a
1184	man were porter of hell-gate, he should have
1185	old turning the key.
1186	
1187	[Knocking within]
1188	Knock,
1189	knock, knock! Who's there, i' the name of
1190	Beelzebub? Here's a farmer, that hanged
1191	himself on the expectation of plenty: come in
1192	time; have napkins enow about you; here
1193	you'll sweat for't.
1194	
1195	[Knocking within]
1196	Knock,
1197	knock! Who's there, in the other devil's
1198	name? Faith, here's an equivocator, that could
1199	swear in both the scales against either scale;
1200	who committed treason enough for God's sake,
1201	yet could not equivocate to heaven: O, come
1202	in, equivocator.
1203	
1204	[Knocking within]
1205	Knock,
1206	knock, knock! Who's there? Faith, here's an
1207	English tailor come hither, for stealing out of
1208	a French hose: come in, tailor; here you may
1209	roast your goose.
1210	
1211	[Knocking within]
1212	Knock,
1213	knock; never at quiet! What are you? But
1214	this place is too cold for hell. I'll devil-porter
1215	it no further: I had thought to have let in
1216	some of all professions that go the primrose
1217	way to the everlasting bonfire.
1218	
1219	[Knocking within]
1220	
1221	Anon, anon! I pray you, remember the porter.
1222	
1223	[Opens the gate]
1224	
1225	[Enter MACDUFF and LENNOX]
1226	
1227	MACDUFF	Was it so late, friend, ere you went to bed,
1228	That you do lie so late?
1229	
1230	Porter	'Faith sir, we were carousing till the
1231	second cock: and drink, sir, is a great
1232	provoker of three things.
1233	
1234	MACDUFF	What three things does drink especially provoke?
1235	
1236	Porter	Marry, sir, nose-painting, sleep, and
1237	urine. Lechery, sir, it provokes, and unprovokes;
1238	it provokes the desire, but it takes
1239	away the performance: therefore, much drink
1240	may be said to be an equivocator with lechery:
1241	it makes him, and it mars him; it sets
1242	him on, and it takes him off; it persuades him,
1243	and disheartens him; makes him stand to, and
1244	not stand to; in conclusion, equivocates him
1245	in a sleep, and, giving him the lie, leaves him.
1246	
1247	MACDUFF	I believe drink gave thee the lie last night.
1248	
1249	Porter	That it did, sir, i' the very throat on
1250	me: but I requited him for his lie; and, I
1251	think, being too strong for him, though he took
1252	up my legs sometime, yet I made a shift to cast
1253	him.
1254	
1255	MACDUFF	Is thy master stirring?
1256	
1257	[Enter MACBETH]
1258	
1259	Our knocking has awaked him; here he comes.
1260	
1261	LENNOX	Good morrow, noble sir.
1262	
1263	MACBETH	Good morrow, both.
1264	
1265	MACDUFF	Is the king stirring, worthy thane?
1266	
1267	MACBETH	Not yet.
1268	
1269	MACDUFF	He did command me to call timely on him:
1270	I have almost slipp'd the hour.
1271	
1272	MACBETH	I'll bring you to him.
1273	
1274	MACDUFF	I know this is a joyful trouble to you;
1275	But yet 'tis one.
1276	
1277	MACBETH	The labour we delight in physics pain.
1278	This is the door.
1279	
1280	MACDUFF	                  I'll make so bold to call,
1281	For 'tis my limited service.
1282	
1283	[Exit]
1284	
1285	LENNOX	Goes the king hence to-day?
1286	
1287	MACBETH	He does: he did appoint so.
1288	
1289	LENNOX	The night has been unruly: where we lay,
1290	Our chimneys were blown down; and, as they say,
1291	Lamentings heard i' the air; strange screams of death,
1292	And prophesying with accents terrible
1293	Of dire combustion and confused events
1294	New hatch'd to the woeful time: the obscure bird
1295	Clamour'd the livelong night: some say, the earth
1296	Was feverous and did shake.
1297	
1298	MACBETH	'Twas a rough night.
1299	
1300	LENNOX	My young remembrance cannot parallel
1301	A fellow to it.
1302	
1303	[Re-enter MACDUFF]
1304	
1305	MACDUFF	O horror, horror, horror! Tongue nor heart
1306	Cannot conceive nor name thee!
1307	
1308	
1309	MACBETH	|
1310	|	What's the matter.
1311	LENNOX	|
1312	
1313	
1314	MACDUFF	Confusion now hath made his masterpiece!
1315	Most sacrilegious murder hath broke ope
1316	The Lord's anointed temple, and stole thence
1317	The life o' the building!
1318	
1319	MACBETH	What is 't you say? the life?
1320	
1321	LENNOX	Mean you his majesty?
1322	
1323	MACDUFF	Approach the chamber, and destroy your sight
1324	With a new Gorgon: do not bid me speak;
1325	See, and then speak yourselves.
1326	
1327	[Exeunt MACBETH and LENNOX]
1328	
1329	Awake, awake!
1330	Ring the alarum-bell. Murder and treason!
1331	Banquo and Donalbain! Malcolm! awake!
1332	Shake off this downy sleep, death's counterfeit,
1333	And look on death itself! up, up, and see
1334	The great doom's image! Malcolm! Banquo!
1335	As from your graves rise up, and walk like sprites,
1336	To countenance this horror! Ring the bell.
1337	
1338	[Bell rings]
1339	
1340	[Enter LADY MACBETH]
1341	
1342	LADY MACBETH	What's the business,
1343	That such a hideous trumpet calls to parley
1344	The sleepers of the house? speak, speak!
1345	
1346	MACDUFF	O gentle lady,
1347	'Tis not for you to hear what I can speak:
1348	The repetition, in a woman's ear,
1349	Would murder as it fell.
1350	
1351	[Enter BANQUO]
1352	
1353	O Banquo, Banquo,
1354	Our royal master 's murder'd!
1355	
1356	LADY MACBETH	Woe, alas!
1357	What, in our house?
1358	
1359	BANQUO	Too cruel any where.
1360	Dear Duff, I prithee, contradict thyself,
1361	And say it is not so.
1362	
1363	[Re-enter MACBETH and LENNOX, with ROSS]
1364	
1365	MACBETH	Had I but died an hour before this chance,
1366	I had lived a blessed time; for, from this instant,
1367	There 's nothing serious in mortality:
1368	All is but toys: renown and grace is dead;
1369	The wine of life is drawn, and the mere lees
1370	Is left this vault to brag of.
1371	
1372	[Enter MALCOLM and DONALBAIN]
1373	
1374	DONALBAIN	What is amiss?
1375	
1376	MACBETH	                  You are, and do not know't:
1377	The spring, the head, the fountain of your blood
1378	Is stopp'd; the very source of it is stopp'd.
1379	
1380	MACDUFF	Your royal father 's murder'd.
1381	
1382	MALCOLM	O, by whom?
1383	
1384	LENNOX	Those of his chamber, as it seem'd, had done 't:
1385	Their hands and faces were an badged with blood;
1386	So were their daggers, which unwiped we found
1387	Upon their pillows:
1388	They stared, and were distracted; no man's life
1389	Was to be trusted with them.
1390	
1391	MACBETH	O, yet I do repent me of my fury,
1392	That I did kill them.
1393	
1394	MACDUFF	Wherefore did you so?
1395	
1396	MACBETH	Who can be wise, amazed, temperate and furious,
1397	Loyal and neutral, in a moment? No man:
1398	The expedition my violent love
1399	Outrun the pauser, reason. Here lay Duncan,
1400	His silver skin laced with his golden blood;
1401	And his gash'd stabs look'd like a breach in nature
1402	For ruin's wasteful entrance: there, the murderers,
1403	Steep'd in the colours of their trade, their daggers
1404	Unmannerly breech'd with gore: who could refrain,
1405	That had a heart to love, and in that heart
1406	Courage to make 's love known?
1407	
1408	LADY MACBETH	Help me hence, ho!
1409	
1410	MACDUFF	Look to the lady.
1411	
1412	MALCOLM	[Aside to DONALBAIN]  Why do we hold our tongues,
1413	That most may claim this argument for ours?
1414	
1415	DONALBAIN	[Aside to MALCOLM]  What should be spoken here,
1416	where our fate,
1417	Hid in an auger-hole, may rush, and seize us?
1418	Let 's away;
1419	Our tears are not yet brew'd.
1420	
1421	MALCOLM	[Aside to DONALBAIN]        Nor our strong sorrow
1422	Upon the foot of motion.
1423	
1424	BANQUO	Look to the lady:
1425	
1426	[LADY MACBETH is carried out]
1427	
1428	And when we have our naked frailties hid,
1429	That suffer in exposure, let us meet,
1430	And question this most bloody piece of work,
1431	To know it further. Fears and scruples shake us:
1432	In the great hand of God I stand; and thence
1433	Against the undivulged pretence I fight
1434	Of treasonous malice.
1435	
1436	MACDUFF	And so do I.
1437	
1438	ALL	So all.
1439	
1440	MACBETH	Let's briefly put on manly readiness,
1441	And meet i' the hall together.
1442	
1443	ALL	Well contented.
1444	
1445	[Exeunt all but Malcolm and Donalbain.
1446	
1447	MALCOLM	What will you do? Let's not consort with them:
1448	To show an unfelt sorrow is an office
1449	Which the false man does easy. I'll to England.
1450	
1451	DONALBAIN	To Ireland, I; our separated fortune
1452	Shall keep us both the safer: where we are,
1453	There's daggers in men's smiles: the near in blood,
1454	The nearer bloody.
1455	
1456	MALCOLM	                  This murderous shaft that's shot
1457	Hath not yet lighted, and our safest way
1458	Is to avoid the aim. Therefore, to horse;
1459	And let us not be dainty of leave-taking,
1460	But shift away: there's warrant in that theft
1461	Which steals itself, when there's no mercy left.

1472	
1473	
1474	
1475	SCENE IV	Outside Macbeth's castle.
1476	
1477	
1478	[Enter ROSS and an old Man]
1479	
1480	Old Man	Threescore and ten I can remember well:
1481	Within the volume of which time I have seen
1482	Hours dreadful and things strange; but this sore night
1483	Hath trifled former knowings.
1484	
1485	ROSS	Ah, good father,
1486	Thou seest, the heavens, as troubled with man's act,
1487	Threaten his bloody stage: by the clock, 'tis day,
1488	And yet dark night strangles the travelling lamp:
1489	Is't night's predominance, or the day's shame,
1490	That darkness does the face of earth entomb,
1491	When living light should kiss it?
1492	
1493	Old Man	'Tis unnatural,
1494	Even like the deed that's done. On Tuesday last,
1495	A falcon, towering in her pride of place,
1496	Was by a mousing owl hawk'd at and kill'd.
1497	
1498	ROSS	And Duncan's horses--a thing most strange and certain--
1499	Beauteous and swift, the minions of their race,
1500	Turn'd wild in nature, broke their stalls, flung out,
1501	Contending 'gainst obedience, as they would make
1502	War with mankind.
1503	
1504	Old Man	'Tis said they eat each other.
1505	
1506	ROSS	They did so, to the amazement of mine eyes
1507	That look'd upon't. Here comes the good Macduff.
1508	
1509	[Enter MACDUFF]
1510	
1511	How goes the world, sir, now?
1512	
1513	MACDUFF	Why, see you not?
1514	
1515	ROSS	Is't known who did this more than bloody deed?
1516	
1517	MACDUFF	Those that Macbeth hath slain.
1518	
1519	ROSS	Alas, the day!
1520	What good could they pretend?
1521	
1522	MACDUFF	They were suborn'd:
1523	Malcolm and Donalbain, the king's two sons,
1524	Are stol'n away and fled; which puts upon them
1525	Suspicion of the deed.
1526	
1527	ROSS	'Gainst nature still!
1528	Thriftless ambition, that wilt ravin up
1529	Thine own life's means! Then 'tis most like
1530	The sovereignty will fall upon Macbeth.
1531	
1532	MACDUFF	He is already named, and gone to Scone
1533	To be invested.
1534	
1535	ROSS	                  Where is Duncan's body?
1536	
1537	MACDUFF	Carried to Colmekill,
1538	The sacred storehouse of his predecessors,
1539	And guardian of their bones.
1540	
1541	ROSS	Will you to Scone?
1542	
1543	MACDUFF	No, cousin, I'll to Fife.
1544	
1545	ROSS	Well, I will thither.
1546	
1547	MACDUFF	Well, may you see things well done there: adieu!
1548	Lest our old robes sit easier than our new!
1549	
1550	ROSS	Farewell, father.
1551	
1552	Old Man	God's benison go with you; and with those
1553	That would make good of bad, and friends of foes!

1568	
1569	
1570	[Enter BANQUO]
1571	
1572	BANQUO	Thou hast it now: king, Cawdor, Glamis, all,
1573	As the weird women promised, and, I fear,
1574	Thou play'dst most foully for't: yet it was said
1575	It should not stand in thy posterity,
1576	But that myself should be the root and father
1577	Of many kings. If there come truth from them--
1578	As upon thee, Macbeth, their speeches shine--
1579	Why, by the verities on thee made good,
1580	May they not be my oracles as well,
1581	And set me up in hope? But hush! no more.
1582	
1583	[Sennet sounded. Enter MACBETH, as king, LADY
1584	MACBETH, as queen, LENNOX, ROSS, Lords, Ladies, and
1585	Attendants]
1586	
1587	MACBETH	Here's our chief guest.
1588	
1589	LADY MACBETH	If he had been forgotten,
1590	It had been as a gap in our great feast,
1591	And all-thing unbecoming.
1592	
1593	MACBETH	To-night we hold a solemn supper sir,
1594	And I'll request your presence.
1595	
1596	BANQUO	Let your highness
1597	Command upon me; to the which my duties
1598	Are with a most indissoluble tie
1599	For ever knit.
1600	
1601	MACBETH	                  Ride you this afternoon?
1602	
1603	BANQUO	Ay, my good lord.
1604	
1605	MACBETH	We should have else desired your good advice,
1606	Which still hath been both grave and prosperous,
1607	In this day's council; but we'll take to-morrow.
1608	Is't far you ride?
1609	
1610	BANQUO	As far, my lord, as will fill up the time
1611	'Twixt this and supper: go not my horse the better,
1612	I must become a borrower of the night
1613	For a dark hour or twain.
1614	
1615	MACBETH	Fail not our feast.
1616	
1617	BANQUO	My lord, I will not.
1618	
1619	MACBETH	We hear, our bloody cousins are bestow'd
1620	In England and in Ireland, not confessing
1621	Their cruel parricide, filling their hearers
1622	With strange invention: but of that to-morrow,
1623	When therewithal we shall have cause of state
1624	Craving us jointly. Hie you to horse: adieu,
1625	Till you return at night. Goes Fleance with you?
1626	
1627	BANQUO	Ay, my good lord: our time does call upon 's.
1628	
1629	MACBETH	I wish your horses swift and sure of foot;
1630	And so I do commend you to their backs. Farewell.
1631	
1632	[Exit BANQUO]
1633	
1634	Let every man be master of his time
1635	Till seven at night: to make society
1636	The sweeter welcome, we will keep ourself
1637	Till supper-time alone: while then, God be with you!
1638	
1639	[Exeunt all but MACBETH, and an attendant]
1640	
1641	Sirrah, a word with you: attend those men
1642	Our pleasure?
1643	
1644	ATTENDANT	They are, my lord, without the palace gate.
1645	
1646	MACBETH	Bring them before us.
1647	
1648	[Exit Attendant]
1649	
1650	To be thus is nothing;
1651	But to be safely thus.--Our fears in Banquo
1652	Stick deep; and in his royalty of nature
1653	Reigns that which would be fear'd: 'tis much he dares;
1654	And, to that dauntless temper of his mind,
1655	He hath a wisdom that doth guide his valour
1656	To act in safety. There is none but he
1657	Whose being I do fear: and, under him,
1658	My Genius is rebuked; as, it is said,
1659	Mark Antony's was by Caesar. He chid the sisters
1660	When first they put the name of king upon me,
1661	And bade them speak to him: then prophet-like
1662	They hail'd him father to a line of kings:
1663	Upon my head they placed a fruitless crown,
1664	And put a barren sceptre in my gripe,
1665	Thence to be wrench'd with an unlineal hand,
1666	No son of mine succeeding. If 't be so,
1667	For Banquo's issue have I filed my mind;
1668	For them the gracious Duncan have I murder'd;
1669	Put rancours in the vessel of my peace
1670	Only for them; and mine eternal jewel
1671	Given to the common enemy of man,
1672	To make them kings, the seed of Banquo kings!
1673	Rather than so, come fate into the list.
1674	And champion me to the utterance! Who's there!
1675	
1676	[Re-enter Attendant, with two Murderers]
1677	
1678	Now go to the door, and stay there till we call.
1679	
1680	[Exit Attendant]
1681	
1682	Was it not yesterday we spoke together?
1683	
1684	First Murderer	It was, so please your highness.
1685	
1686	MACBETH	Well then, now
1687	Have you consider'd of my speeches? Know
1688	That it was he in the times past which held you
1689	So under fortune, which you thought had been
1690	Our innocent self: this I made good to you
1691	In our last conference, pass'd in probation with you,
1692	How you were borne in hand, how cross'd,
1693	the instruments,
1694	Who wrought with them, and all things else that might
1695	To half a soul and to a notion crazed
1696	Say 'Thus did Banquo.'
1697	
1698	First Murderer	You made it known to us.
1699	
1700	MACBETH	I did so, and went further, which is now
1701	Our point of second meeting. Do you find
1702	Your patience so predominant in your nature
1703	That you can let this go? Are you so gospell'd
1704	To pray for this good man and for his issue,
1705	Whose heavy hand hath bow'd you to the grave
1706	And beggar'd yours for ever?
1707	
1708	First Murderer	We are men, my liege.
1709	
1710	MACBETH	Ay, in the catalogue ye go for men;
1711	As hounds and greyhounds, mongrels, spaniels, curs,
1712	Shoughs, water-rugs and demi-wolves, are clept
1713	All by the name of dogs: the valued file
1714	Distinguishes the swift, the slow, the subtle,
1715	The housekeeper, the hunter, every one
1716	According to the gift which bounteous nature
1717	Hath in him closed; whereby he does receive
1718	Particular addition. from the bill
1719	That writes them all alike: and so of men.
1720	Now, if you have a station in the file,
1721	Not i' the worst rank of manhood, say 't;
1722	And I will put that business in your bosoms,
1723	Whose execution takes your enemy off,
1724	Grapples you to the heart and love of us,
1725	Who wear our health but sickly in his life,
1726	Which in his death were perfect.
1727	
1728	Second Murderer	I am one, my liege,
1729	Whom the vile blows and buffets of the world
1730	Have so incensed that I am reckless what
1731	I do to spite the world.
1732	
1733	First Murderer	And I another
1734	So weary with disasters, tugg'd with fortune,
1735	That I would set my lie on any chance,
1736	To mend it, or be rid on't.
1737	
1738	MACBETH	Both of you
1739	Know Banquo was your enemy.
1740	
1741	Both Murderers	True, my lord.
1742	
1743	MACBETH	So is he mine; and in such bloody distance,
1744	That every minute of his being thrusts
1745	Against my near'st of life: and though I could
1746	With barefaced power sweep him from my sight
1747	And bid my will avouch it, yet I must not,
1748	For certain friends that are both his and mine,
1749	Whose loves I may not drop, but wail his fall
1750	Who I myself struck down; and thence it is,
1751	That I to your assistance do make love,
1752	Masking the business from the common eye
1753	For sundry weighty reasons.
1754	
1755	Second Murderer	We shall, my lord,
1756	Perform what you command us.
1757	
1758	First Murderer	Though our lives--
1759	
1760	MACBETH	Your spirits shine through you. Within this hour at most
1761	I will advise you where to plant yourselves;
1762	Acquaint you with the perfect spy o' the time,
1763	The moment on't; for't must be done to-night,
1764	And something from the palace; always thought
1765	That I require a clearness: and with him--
1766	To leave no rubs nor botches in the work--
1767	Fleance his son, that keeps him company,
1768	Whose absence is no less material to me
1769	Than is his father's, must embrace the fate
1770	Of that dark hour. Resolve yourselves apart:
1771	I'll come to you anon.
1772	
1773	Both Murderers	We are resolved, my lord.
1774	
1775	MACBETH	I'll call upon you straight: abide within.
1776	
1777	[Exeunt Murderers]
1778	
1779	It is concluded. Banquo, thy soul's flight,
1780	If it find heaven, must find it out to-night.

1795	
1796	
1797	[Enter LADY MACBETH and a Servant]
1798	
1799	LADY MACBETH	Is Banquo gone from court?
1800	
1801	Servant	Ay, madam, but returns again to-night.
1802	
1803	LADY MACBETH	Say to the king, I would attend his leisure
1804	For a few words.
1805	
1806	Servant	                  Madam, I will.
1807	
1808	[Exit]
1809	
1810	LADY MACBETH	Nought's had, all's spent,
1811	Where our desire is got without content:
1812	'Tis safer to be that which we destroy
1813	Than by destruction dwell in doubtful joy.
1814	
1815	[Enter MACBETH]
1816	
1817	How now, my lord! why do you keep alone,
1818	Of sorriest fancies your companions making,
1819	Using those thoughts which should indeed have died
1820	With them they think on? Things without all remedy
1821	Should be without regard: what's done is done.
1822	
1823	MACBETH	We have scotch'd the snake, not kill'd it:
1824	She'll close and be herself, whilst our poor malice
1825	Remains in danger of her former tooth.
1826	But let the frame of things disjoint, both the
1827	worlds suffer,
1828	Ere we will eat our meal in fear and sleep
1829	In the affliction of these terrible dreams
1830	That shake us nightly: better be with the dead,
1831	Whom we, to gain our peace, have sent to peace,
1832	Than on the torture of the mind to lie
1833	In restless ecstasy. Duncan is in his grave;
1834	After life's fitful fever he sleeps well;
1835	Treason has done his worst: nor steel, nor poison,
1836	Malice domestic, foreign levy, nothing,
1837	Can touch him further.
1838	
1839	LADY MACBETH	Come on;
1840	Gentle my lord, sleek o'er your rugged looks;
1841	Be bright and jovial among your guests to-night.
1842	
1843	MACBETH	So shall I, love; and so, I pray, be you:
1844	Let your remembrance apply to Banquo;
1845	Present him eminence, both with eye and tongue:
1846	Unsafe the while, that we
1847	Must lave our honours in these flattering streams,
1848	And make our faces vizards to our hearts,
1849	Disguising what they are.
1850	
1851	LADY MACBETH	You must leave this.
1852	
1853	MACBETH	O, full of scorpions is my mind, dear wife!
1854	Thou know'st that Banquo, and his Fleance, lives.
1855	
1856	LADY MACBETH	But in them nature's copy's not eterne.
1857	
1858	MACBETH	There's comfort yet; they are assailable;
1859	Then be thou jocund: ere the bat hath flown
1860	His cloister'd flight, ere to black Hecate's summons
1861	The shard-borne beetle with his drowsy hums
1862	Hath rung night's yawning peal, there shall be done
1863	A deed of dreadful note.
1864	
1865	LADY MACBETH	What's to be done?
1866	
1867	MACBETH	Be innocent of the knowledge, dearest chuck,
1868	Till thou applaud the deed. Come, seeling night,
1869	Scarf up the tender eye of pitiful day;
1870	And with thy bloody and invisible hand
1871	Cancel and tear to pieces that great bond
1872	Which keeps me pale! Light thickens; and the crow
1873	Makes wing to the rooky wood:
1874	Good things of day begin to droop and drowse;
1875	While night's black agents to their preys do rouse.
1876	Thou marvell'st at my words: but hold thee still;
1877	Things bad begun make strong themselves by ill.
1878	So, prithee, go with me.

1894	
1895	[Enter three Murderers]
1896	
1897	First Murderer	But who did bid thee join with us?
1898	
1899	Third Murderer	Macbeth.
1900	
1901	Second Murderer	He needs not our mistrust, since he delivers
1902	Our offices and what we have to do
1903	To the direction just.
1904	
1905	First Murderer	Then stand with us.
1906	The west yet glimmers with some streaks of day:
1907	Now spurs the lated traveller apace
1908	To gain the timely inn; and near approaches
1909	The subject of our watch.
1910	
1911	Third Murderer	Hark! I hear horses.
1912	
1913	BANQUO	[Within]  Give us a light there, ho!
1914	
1915	Second Murderer	Then 'tis he: the rest
1916	That are within the note of expectation
1917	Already are i' the court.
1918	
1919	First Murderer	His horses go about.
1920	
1921	Third Murderer	Almost a mile: but he does usually,
1922	So all men do, from hence to the palace gate
1923	Make it their walk.
1924	
1925	Second Murderer	A light, a light!
1926	
1927	[Enter BANQUO, and FLEANCE with a torch]
1928	
1929	Third Murderer	'Tis he.
1930	
1931	First Murderer	Stand to't.
1932	
1933	BANQUO	It will be rain to-night.
1934	
1935	First Murderer	Let it come down.
1936	
1937	[They set upon BANQUO]
1938	
1939	BANQUO	O, treachery! Fly, good Fleance, fly, fly, fly!
1940	Thou mayst revenge. O slave!
1941	
1942	[Dies. FLEANCE escapes]
1943	
1944	Third Murderer	Who did strike out the light?
1945	
1946	First Murderer	Wast not the way?
1947	
1948	Third Murderer	There's but one down; the son is fled.
1949	
1950	Second Murderer	We have lost
1951	Best half of our affair.
1952	
1953	First Murderer	Well, let's away, and say how much is done.

1969	
1970	[A banquet prepared. Enter MACBETH, LADY MACBETH,
1971	ROSS, LENNOX, Lords, and Attendants]
1972	
1973	MACBETH	You know your own degrees; sit down: at first
1974	And last the hearty welcome.
1975	Lords	Thanks to your majesty.
1976	
1977	MACBETH	Ourself will mingle with society,
1978	And play the humble host.
1979	Our hostess keeps her state, but in best time
1980	We will require her welcome.
1981	
1982	LADY MACBETH	Pronounce it for me, sir, to all our friends;
1983	For my heart speaks they are welcome.
1984	
1985	[First Murderer appears at the door]
1986	
1987	MACBETH	See, they encounter thee with their hearts' thanks.
1988	Both sides are even: here I'll sit i' the midst:
1989	Be large in mirth; anon we'll drink a measure
1990	The table round.
1991	
1992	[Approaching the door]
1993	
1994	There's blood on thy face.
1995	
1996	First Murderer	'Tis Banquo's then.
1997	
1998	MACBETH	'Tis better thee without than he within.
1999	Is he dispatch'd?
2000	
2001	First Murderer	My lord, his throat is cut; that I did for him.
2002	
2003	MACBETH	Thou art the best o' the cut-throats: yet he's good
2004	That did the like for Fleance: if thou didst it,
2005	Thou art the nonpareil.
2006	
2007	First Murderer	Most royal sir,
2008	Fleance is 'scaped.
2009	
2010	MACBETH	Then comes my fit again: I had else been perfect,
2011	Whole as the marble, founded as the rock,
2012	As broad and general as the casing air:
2013	But now I am cabin'd, cribb'd, confined, bound in
2014	To saucy doubts and fears. But Banquo's safe?
2015	
2016	First Murderer	Ay, my good lord: safe in a ditch he bides,
2017	With twenty trenched gashes on his head;
2018	The least a death to nature.
2019	
2020	MACBETH	Thanks for that:
2021	There the grown serpent lies; the worm that's fled
2022	Hath nature that in time will venom breed,
2023	No teeth for the present. Get thee gone: to-morrow
2024	We'll hear, ourselves, again.
2025	
2026	[Exit Murderer]
2027	
2028	LADY MACBETH	My royal lord,
2029	You do not give the cheer: the feast is sold
2030	That is not often vouch'd, while 'tis a-making,
2031	'Tis given with welcome: to feed were best at home;
2032	From thence the sauce to meat is ceremony;
2033	Meeting were bare without it.
2034	
2035	MACBETH	Sweet remembrancer!
2036	Now, good digestion wait on appetite,
2037	And health on both!
2038	
2039	LENNOX	May't please your highness sit.
2040	
2041	[The GHOST OF BANQUO enters, and sits in
2042	MACBETH's place]
2043	
2044	MACBETH	Here had we now our country's honour roof'd,
2045	Were the graced person of our Banquo present;
2046	Who may I rather challenge for unkindness
2047	Than pity for mischance!
2048	
2049	ROSS	His absence, sir,
2050	Lays blame upon his promise. Please't your highness
2051	To grace us with your royal company.
2052	
2053	MACBETH	The table's full.
2054	
2055	LENNOX	                  Here is a place reserved, sir.
2056	
2057	MACBETH	Where?
2058	
2059	LENNOX	Here, my good lord. What is't that moves your highness?
2060	
2061	MACBETH	Which of you have done this?
2062	
2063	Lords	What, my good lord?
2064	
2065	MACBETH	Thou canst not say I did it: never shake
2066	Thy gory locks at me.
2067	
2068	ROSS	Gentlemen, rise: his highness is not well.
2069	
2070	LADY MACBETH	Sit, worthy friends: my lord is often thus,
2071	And hath been from his youth: pray you, keep seat;
2072	The fit is momentary; upon a thought
2073	He will again be well: if much you note him,
2074	You shall offend him and extend his passion:
2075	Feed, and regard him not. Are you a man?
2076	
2077	MACBETH	Ay, and a bold one, that dare look on that
2078	Which might appal the devil.
2079	
2080	LADY MACBETH	O proper stuff!
2081	This is the very painting of your fear:
2082	This is the air-drawn dagger which, you said,
2083	Led you to Duncan. O, these flaws and starts,
2084	Impostors to true fear, would well become
2085	A woman's story at a winter's fire,
2086	Authorized by her grandam. Shame itself!
2087	Why do you make such faces? When all's done,
2088	You look but on a stool.
2089	
2090	MACBETH	Prithee, see there! behold! look! lo!
2091	how say you?
2092	Why, what care I? If thou canst nod, speak too.
2093	If charnel-houses and our graves must send
2094	Those that we bury back, our monuments
2095	Shall be the maws of kites.
2096	
2097	[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]
2098	
2099	LADY MACBETH	What, quite unmann'd in folly?
2100	
2101	MACBETH	If I stand here, I saw him.
2102	
2103	LADY MACBETH	Fie, for shame!
2104	
2105	MACBETH	Blood hath been shed ere now, i' the olden time,
2106	Ere human statute purged the gentle weal;
2107	Ay, and since too, murders have been perform'd
2108	Too terrible for the ear: the times have been,
2109	That, when the brains were out, the man would die,
2110	And there an end; but now they rise again,
2111	With twenty mortal murders on their crowns,
2112	And push us from our stools: this is more strange
2113	Than such a murder is.
2114	
2115	LADY MACBETH	My worthy lord,
2116	Your noble friends do lack you.
2117	
2118	MACBETH	I do forget.
2119	Do not muse at me, my most worthy friends,
2120	I have a strange infirmity, which is nothing
2121	To those that know me. Come, love and health to all;
2122	Then I'll sit down. Give me some wine; fill full.
2123	I drink to the general joy o' the whole table,
2124	And to our dear friend Banquo, whom we miss;
2125	Would he were here! to all, and him, we thirst,
2126	And all to all.
2127	
2128	Lords	                  Our duties, and the pledge.
2129	
2130	[Re-enter GHOST OF BANQUO]
2131	
2132	MACBETH	Avaunt! and quit my sight! let the earth hide thee!
2133	Thy bones are marrowless, thy blood is cold;
2134	Thou hast no speculation in those eyes
2135	Which thou dost glare with!
2136	
2137	LADY MACBETH	Think of this, good peers,
2138	But as a thing of custom: 'tis no other;
2139	Only it spoils the pleasure of the time.
2140	
2141	MACBETH	What man dare, I dare:
2142	Approach thou like the rugged Russian bear,
2143	The arm'd rhinoceros, or the Hyrcan tiger;
2144	Take any shape but that, and my firm nerves
2145	Shall never tremble: or be alive again,
2146	And dare me to the desert with thy sword;
2147	If trembling I inhabit then, protest me
2148	The baby of a girl. Hence, horrible shadow!
2149	Unreal mockery, hence!
2150	
2151	[GHOST OF BANQUO vanishes]
2152	
2153	Why, so: being gone,
2154	I am a man again. Pray you, sit still.
2155	
2156	LADY MACBETH	You have displaced the mirth, broke the good meeting,
2157	With most admired disorder.
2158	
2159	MACBETH	Can such things be,
2160	And overcome us like a summer's cloud,
2161	Without our special wonder? You make me strange
2162	Even to the disposition that I owe,
2163	When now I think you can behold such sights,
2164	And keep the natural ruby of your cheeks,
2165	When mine is blanched with fear.
2166	
2167	ROSS	What sights, my lord?
2168	
2169	LADY MACBETH	I pray you, speak not; he grows worse and worse;
2170	Question enrages him. At once, good night:
2171	Stand not upon the order of your going,
2172	But go at once.
2173	
2174	LENNOX	                  Good night; and better health
2175	Attend his majesty!
2176	
2177	LADY MACBETH	A kind good night to all!
2178	
2179	[Exeunt all but MACBETH and LADY MACBETH]
2180	
2181	MACBETH	It will have blood; they say, blood will have blood:
2182	Stones have been known to move and trees to speak;
2183	Augurs and understood relations have
2184	By magot-pies and choughs and rooks brought forth
2185	The secret'st man of blood. What is the night?
2186	
2187	LADY MACBETH	Almost at odds with morning, which is which.
2188	
2189	MACBETH	How say'st thou, that Macduff denies his person
2190	At our great bidding?
2191	
2192	LADY MACBETH	Did you send to him, sir?
2193	
2194	MACBETH	I hear it by the way; but I will send:
2195	There's not a one of them but in his house
2196	I keep a servant fee'd. I will to-morrow,
2197	And betimes I will, to the weird sisters:
2198	More shall they speak; for now I am bent to know,
2199	By the worst means, the worst. For mine own good,
2200	All causes shall give way: I am in blood
2201	Stepp'd in so far that, should I wade no more,
2202	Returning were as tedious as go o'er:
2203	Strange things I have in head, that will to hand;
2204	Which must be acted ere they may be scann'd.
2205	
2206	LADY MACBETH	You lack the season of all natures, sleep.
2207	
2208	MACBETH	Come, we'll to sleep. My strange and self-abuse
2209	Is the initiate fear that wants hard use:
2210	We are yet but young in deed.

2226	
2227	[Thunder. Enter the three Witches meeting HECATE]
2228	
2229	First Witch	Why, how now, Hecate! you look angerly.
2230	
2231	HECATE	Have I not reason, beldams as you are,
2232	Saucy and overbold? How did you dare
2233	To trade and traffic with Macbeth
2234	In riddles and affairs of death;
2235	And I, the mistress of your charms,
2236	The close contriver of all harms,
2237	Was never call'd to bear my part,
2238	Or show the glory of our art?
2239	And, which is worse, all you have done
2240	Hath been but for a wayward son,
2241	Spiteful and wrathful, who, as others do,
2242	Loves for his own ends, not for you.
2243	But make amends now: get you gone,
2244	And at the pit of Acheron
2245	Meet me i' the morning: thither he
2246	Will come to know his destiny:
2247	Your vessels and your spells provide,
2248	Your charms and every thing beside.
2249	I am for the air; this night I'll spend
2250	Unto a dismal and a fatal end:
2251	Great business must be wrought ere noon:
2252	Upon the corner of the moon
2253	There hangs a vaporous drop profound;
2254	I'll catch it ere it come to ground:
2255	And that distill'd by magic sleights
2256	Shall raise such artificial sprites
2257	As by the strength of their illusion
2258	Shall draw him on to his confusion:
2259	He shall spurn fate, scorn death, and bear
2260	He hopes 'bove wisdom, grace and fear:
2261	And you all know, security
2262	Is mortals' chiefest enemy.

2287	
2288	
2289	[Enter LENNOX and another Lord]
2290	
2291	LENNOX	My former speeches have but hit your thoughts,
2292	Which can interpret further: only, I say,
2293	Things have been strangely borne. The
2294	gracious Duncan
2295	Was pitied of Macbeth: marry, he was dead:
2296	And the right-valiant Banquo walk'd too late;
2297	Whom, you may say, if't please you, Fleance kill'd,
2298	For Fleance fled: men must not walk too late.
2299	Who cannot want the thought how monstrous
2300	It was for Malcolm and for Donalbain
2301	To kill their gracious father? damned fact!
2302	How it did grieve Macbeth! did he not straight
2303	In pious rage the two delinquents tear,
2304	That were the slaves of drink and thralls of sleep?
2305	Was not that nobly done? Ay, and wisely too;
2306	For 'twould have anger'd any heart alive
2307	To hear the men deny't. So that, I say,
2308	He has borne all things well: and I do think
2309	That had he Duncan's sons under his key--
2310	As, an't please heaven, he shall not--they
2311	should find
2312	What 'twere to kill a father; so should Fleance.
2313	But, peace! for from broad words and 'cause he fail'd
2314	His presence at the tyrant's feast, I hear
2315	Macduff lives in disgrace: sir, can you tell
2316	Where he bestows himself?
2317	
2318	Lord	The son of Duncan,
2319	From whom this tyrant holds the due of birth
2320	Lives in the English court, and is received
2321	Of the most pious Edward with such grace
2322	That the malevolence of fortune nothing
2323	Takes from his high respect: thither Macduff
2324	Is gone to pray the holy king, upon his aid
2325	To wake Northumberland and warlike Siward:
2326	That, by the help of these--with Him above
2327	To ratify the work--we may again
2328	Give to our tables meat, sleep to our nights,
2329	Free from our feasts and banquets bloody knives,
2330	Do faithful homage and receive free honours:
2331	All which we pine for now: and this report
2332	Hath so exasperate the king that he
2333	Prepares for some attempt of war.
2334	
2335	LENNOX	Sent he to Macduff?
2336	
2337	Lord	He did: and with an absolute 'Sir, not I,'
2338	The cloudy messenger turns me his back,
2339	And hums, as who should say 'You'll rue the time
2340	That clogs me with this answer.'
2341	
2342	LENNOX	And that well might
2343	Advise him to a caution, to hold what distance
2344	His wisdom can provide. Some holy angel
2345	Fly to the court of England and unfold
2346	His message ere he come, that a swift blessing
2347	May soon return to this our suffering country
2348	Under a hand accursed!
2349	
2350	Lord	I'll send my prayers with him.

2368	
2369	
2370	First Witch	Thrice the brinded cat hath mew'd.
2371	
2372	Second Witch	Thrice and once the hedge-pig whined.
2373	
2374	Third Witch	Harpier cries 'Tis time, 'tis time.
2375	
2376	First Witch	Round about the cauldron go;
2377	In the poison'd entrails throw.
2378	Toad, that under cold stone
2379	Days and nights has thirty-one
2380	Swelter'd venom sleeping got,
2381	Boil thou first i' the charmed pot.
2382	
2383	ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;
2384	Fire burn, and cauldron bubble.
2385	
2386	Second Witch	Fillet of a fenny snake,
2387	In the cauldron boil and bake;
2388	Eye of newt and toe of frog,
2389	Wool of bat and tongue of dog,
2390	Adder's fork and blind-worm's sting,
2391	Lizard's leg and owlet's wing,
2392	For a charm of powerful trouble,
2393	Like a hell-broth boil and bubble.
2394	
2395	ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;
2396	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
2397	
2398	Third Witch	Scale of dragon, tooth of wolf,
2399	Witches' mummy, maw and gulf
2400	Of the ravin'd salt-sea shark,
2401	Root of hemlock digg'd i' the dark,
2402	Liver of blaspheming Jew,
2403	Gall of goat, and slips of yew
2404	Silver'd in the moon's eclipse,
2405	Nose of Turk and Tartar's lips,
2406	Finger of birth-strangled babe
2407	Ditch-deliver'd by a drab,
2408	Make the gruel thick and slab:
2409	Add thereto a tiger's chaudron,
2410	For the ingredients of our cauldron.
2411	
2412	ALL	Double, double toil and trouble;
2413	Fire burn and cauldron bubble.
2414	
2415	Second Witch	Cool it with a baboon's blood,
2416	Then the charm is firm and good.
2417	
2418	[Enter HECATE to the other three Witches]
2419	
2420	HECATE	O well done! I commend your pains;
2421	And every one shall share i' the gains;
2422	And now about the cauldron sing,
2423	Live elves and fairies in a ring,
2424	Enchanting all that you put in.
2425	
2426	[Music and a song: 'Black spirits,' &c]
2427	
2428	[HECATE retires]
2429	
2430	Second Witch	By the pricking of my thumbs,
2431	Something wicked this way comes.
2432	Open, locks,
2433	Whoever knocks!
2434	
2435	[Enter MACBETH]
2436	
2437	MACBETH	How now, you secret, black, and midnight hags!
2438	What is't you do?
2439	
2440	ALL	                  A deed without a name.
2441	
2442	MACBETH	I conjure you, by that which you profess,
2443	Howe'er you come to know it, answer me:
2444	Though you untie the winds and let them fight
2445	Against the churches; though the yesty waves
2446	Confound and swallow navigation up;
2447	Though bladed corn be lodged and trees blown down;
2448	Though castles topple on their warders' heads;
2449	Though palaces and pyramids do slope
2450	Their heads to their foundations; though the treasure
2451	Of nature's germens tumble all together,
2452	Even till destruction sicken; answer me
2453	To what I ask you.
2454	
2455	First Witch	                  Speak.
2456	
2457	Second Witch	Demand.
2458	
2459	Third Witch	We'll answer.
2460	
2461	First Witch	Say, if thou'dst rather hear it from our mouths,
2462	Or from our masters?
2463	
2464	MACBETH	Call 'em; let me see 'em.
2465	
2466	First Witch	Pour in sow's blood, that hath eaten
2467	Her nine farrow; grease that's sweaten
2468	From the murderer's gibbet throw
2469	Into the flame.
2470	
2471	ALL	                  Come, high or low;
2472	Thyself and office deftly show!
2473	
2474	[Thunder. First Apparition: an armed Head]
2475	
2476	MACBETH	Tell me, thou unknown power,--
2477	
2478	First Witch	He knows thy thought:
2479	Hear his speech, but say thou nought.
2480	
2481	First Apparition	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth! beware Macduff;
2482	Beware the thane of Fife. Dismiss me. Enough.
2483	
2484	[Descends]
2485	
2486	MACBETH	Whate'er thou art, for thy good caution, thanks;
2487	Thou hast harp'd my fear aright: but one
2488	word more,--
2489	
2490	First Witch	He will not be commanded: here's another,
2491	More potent than the first.
2492	
2493	[Thunder. Second Apparition: A bloody Child]
2494	
2495	Second Apparition	Macbeth! Macbeth! Macbeth!
2496	
2497	MACBETH	Had I three ears, I'ld hear thee.
2498	
2499	Second Apparition	Be bloody, bold, and resolute; laugh to scorn
2500	The power of man, for none of woman born
2501	Shall harm Macbeth.
2502	
2503	[Descends]
2504	
2505	MACBETH	Then live, Macduff: what need I fear of thee?
2506	But yet I'll make assurance double sure,
2507	And take a bond of fate: thou shalt not live;
2508	That I may tell pale-hearted fear it lies,
2509	And sleep in spite of thunder.
2510	
2511	[Thunder. Third Apparition: a Child crowned,
2512	with a tree in his hand]
2513	
2514	What is this
2515	That rises like the issue of a king,
2516	And wears upon his baby-brow the round
2517	And top of sovereignty?
2518	
2519	ALL	Listen, but speak not to't.
2520	
2521	Third Apparition	Be lion-mettled, proud; and take no care
2522	Who chafes, who frets, or where conspirers are:
2523	Macbeth shall never vanquish'd be until
2524	Great Birnam wood to high Dunsinane hill
2525	Shall come against him.
2526	
2527	[Descends]
2528	
2529	MACBETH	That will never be
2530	Who can impress the forest, bid the tree
2531	Unfix his earth-bound root? Sweet bodements! good!
2532	Rebellion's head, rise never till the wood
2533	Of Birnam rise, and our high-placed Macbeth
2534	Shall live the lease of nature, pay his breath
2535	To time and mortal custom. Yet my heart
2536	Throbs to know one thing: tell me, if your art
2537	Can tell so much: shall Banquo's issue ever
2538	Reign in this kingdom?
2539	
2540	ALL	Seek to know no more.
2541	
2542	MACBETH	I will be satisfied: deny me this,
2543	And an eternal curse fall on you! Let me know.
2544	Why sinks that cauldron? and what noise is this?
2545	
2546	[Hautboys]
2547	
2548	First Witch	Show!
2549	
2550	Second Witch	Show!
2551	
2552	Third Witch	Show!
2553	
2554	ALL	Show his eyes, and grieve his heart;
2555	Come like shadows, so depart!
2556	
2557	[A show of Eight Kings, the last with a glass in
2558	his hand; GHOST OF BANQUO following]
2559	
2560	MACBETH	Thou art too like the spirit of Banquo: down!
2561	Thy crown does sear mine eye-balls. And thy hair,
2562	Thou other gold-bound brow, is like the first.
2563	A third is like the former. Filthy hags!
2564	Why do you show me this? A fourth! Start, eyes!
2565	What, will the line stretch out to the crack of doom?
2566	Another yet! A seventh! I'll see no more:
2567	And yet the eighth appears, who bears a glass
2568	Which shows me many more; and some I see
2569	That two-fold balls and treble scepters carry:
2570	Horrible sight! Now, I see, 'tis true;
2571	For the blood-bolter'd Banquo smiles upon me,
2572	And points at them for his.
2573	
2574	[Apparitions vanish]
2575	
2576	What, is this so?
2577	
2578	First Witch	Ay, sir, all this is so: but why
2579	Stands Macbeth thus amazedly?
2580	Come, sisters, cheer we up his sprites,
2581	And show the best of our delights:
2582	I'll charm the air to give a sound,
2583	While you perform your antic round:
2584	That this great king may kindly say,
2585	Our duties did his welcome pay.
2586	
2587	[Music. The witches dance and then vanish,
2588	with HECATE]
2589	
2590	MACBETH	Where are they? Gone? Let this pernicious hour
2591	Stand aye accursed in the calendar!
2592	Come in, without there!
2593	
2594	[Enter LENNOX]
2595	
2596	LENNOX	What's your grace's will?
2597	
2598	MACBETH	Saw you the weird sisters?
2599	
2600	LENNOX	No, my lord.
2601	
2602	MACBETH	Came they not by you?
2603	
2604	LENNOX	No, indeed, my lord.
2605	
2606	MACBETH	Infected be the air whereon they ride;
2607	And damn'd all those that trust them! I did hear
2608	The galloping of horse: who was't came by?
2609	
2610	LENNOX	'Tis two or three, my lord, that bring you word
2611	Macduff is fled to England.
2612	
2613	MACBETH	Fled to England!
2614	
2615	LENNOX	Ay, my good lord.
2616	
2617	MACBETH	Time, thou anticipatest my dread exploits:
2618	The flighty purpose never is o'ertook
2619	Unless the deed go with it; from this moment
2620	The very firstlings of my heart shall be
2621	The firstlings of my hand. And even now,
2622	To crown my thoughts with acts, be it thought and done:
2623	The castle of Macduff I will surprise;
2624	Seize upon Fife; give to the edge o' the sword
2625	His wife, his babes, and all unfortunate souls
2626	That trace him in his line. No boasting like a fool;
2627	This deed I'll do before this purpose cool.
2628	But no more sights!--Where are these gentlemen?
2629	Come, bring me where they are.

2645	
2646	[Enter LADY MACDUFF, her Son, and ROSS]
2647	
2648	LADY MACDUFF	What had he done, to make him fly the land?
2649	
2650	ROSS	You must have patience, madam.
2651	
2652	LADY MACDUFF	He had none:
2653	His flight was madness: when our actions do not,
2654	Our fears do make us traitors.
2655	
2656	ROSS	You know not
2657	Whether it was his wisdom or his fear.
2658	
2659	LADY MACDUFF	Wisdom! to leave his wife, to leave his babes,
2660	His mansion and his titles in a place
2661	From whence himself does fly? He loves us not;
2662	He wants the natural touch: for the poor wren,
2663	The most diminutive of birds, will fight,
2664	Her young ones in her nest, against the owl.
2665	All is the fear and nothing is the love;
2666	As little is the wisdom, where the flight
2667	So runs against all reason.
2668	
2669	ROSS	My dearest coz,
2670	I pray you, school yourself: but for your husband,
2671	He is noble, wise, judicious, and best knows
2672	The fits o' the season. I dare not speak
2673	much further;
2674	But cruel are the times, when we are traitors
2675	And do not know ourselves, when we hold rumour
2676	From what we fear, yet know not what we fear,
2677	But float upon a wild and violent sea
2678	Each way and move. I take my leave of you:
2679	Shall not be long but I'll be here again:
2680	Things at the worst will cease, or else climb upward
2681	To what they were before. My pretty cousin,
2682	Blessing upon you!
2683	
2684	LADY MACDUFF	Father'd he is, and yet he's fatherless.
2685	
2686	ROSS	I am so much a fool, should I stay longer,
2687	It would be my disgrace and your discomfort:
2688	I take my leave at once.
2689	
2690	[Exit]
2691	
2692	LADY MACDUFF	Sirrah, your father's dead;
2693	And what will you do now? How will you live?
2694	
2695	Son	As birds do, mother.
2696	
2697	LADY MACDUFF	What, with worms and flies?
2698	
2699	Son	With what I get, I mean; and so do they.
2700	
2701	LADY MACDUFF	Poor bird! thou'ldst never fear the net nor lime,
2702	The pitfall nor the gin.
2703	
2704	Son	Why should I, mother? Poor birds they are not set for.
2705	My father is not dead, for all your saying.
2706	
2707	LADY MACDUFF	Yes, he is dead; how wilt thou do for a father?
2708	
2709	Son	Nay, how will you do for a husband?
2710	
2711	LADY MACDUFF	Why, I can buy me twenty at any market.
2712	
2713	Son	Then you'll buy 'em to sell again.
2714	
2715	LADY MACDUFF	Thou speak'st with all thy wit: and yet, i' faith,
2716	With wit enough for thee.
2717	
2718	Son	Was my father a traitor, mother?
2719	
2720	LADY MACDUFF	Ay, that he was.
2721	
2722	Son	What is a traitor?
2723	
2724	LADY MACDUFF	Why, one that swears and lies.
2725	
2726	Son	And be all traitors that do so?
2727	
2728	LADY MACDUFF	Every one that does so is a traitor, and must be hanged.
2729	
2730	Son	And must they all be hanged that swear and lie?
2731	
2732	LADY MACDUFF	Every one.
2733	
2734	Son	Who must hang them?
2735	
2736	LADY MACDUFF	Why, the honest men.
2737	
2738	Son	Then the liars and swearers are fools,
2739	for there are liars and swearers enow to beat
2740	the honest men and hang up them.
2741	
2742	LADY MACDUFF	Now, God help thee, poor monkey!
2743	But how wilt thou do for a father?
2744	
2745	Son	If he were dead, you'ld weep for
2746	him: if you would not, it were a good sign
2747	that I should quickly have a new father.
2748	
2749	LADY MACDUFF	Poor prattler, how thou talk'st!
2750	
2751	[Enter a Messenger]
2752	
2753	Messenger	Bless you, fair dame! I am not to you known,
2754	Though in your state of honour I am perfect.
2755	I doubt some danger does approach you nearly:
2756	If you will take a homely man's advice,
2757	Be not found here; hence, with your little ones.
2758	To fright you thus, methinks, I am too savage;
2759	To do worse to you were fell cruelty,
2760	Which is too nigh your person. Heaven preserve you!
2761	I dare abide no longer.
2762	
2763	[Exit]
2764	
2765	LADY MACDUFF	Whither should I fly?
2766	I have done no harm. But I remember now
2767	I am in this earthly world; where to do harm
2768	Is often laudable, to do good sometime
2769	Accounted dangerous folly: why then, alas,
2770	Do I put up that womanly defence,
2771	To say I have done no harm?
2772	
2773	[Enter Murderers]
2774	
2775	What are these faces?
2776	
2777	First Murderer	Where is your husband?
2778	
2779	LADY MACDUFF	I hope, in no place so unsanctified
2780	Where such as thou mayst find him.
2781	
2782	First Murderer	He's a traitor.
2783	
2784	Son	Thou liest, thou shag-hair'd villain!
2785	
2786	First Murderer	What, you egg!
2787	
2788	[Stabbing him]
2789	
2790	Young fry of treachery!

2819	Bestride our down-fall'n birthdom: each new morn
2820	New widows howl, new orphans cry, new sorrows
2821	Strike heaven on the face, that it resounds
2822	As if it felt with Scotland and yell'd out
2823	Like syllable of dolour.
2824	
2825	MALCOLM	What I believe I'll wail,
2826	What know believe, and what I can redress,
2827	As I shall find the time to friend, I will.
2828	What you have spoke, it may be so perchance.
2829	This tyrant, whose sole name blisters our tongues,
2830	Was once thought honest: you have loved him well.
2831	He hath not touch'd you yet. I am young;
2832	but something
2833	You may deserve of him through me, and wisdom
2834	To offer up a weak poor innocent lamb
2835	To appease an angry god.
2836	
2837	MACDUFF	I am not treacherous.
2838	
2839	MALCOLM	But Macbeth is.
2840	A good and virtuous nature may recoil
2841	In an imperial charge. But I shall crave
2842	your pardon;
2843	That which you are my thoughts cannot transpose:
2844	Angels are bright still, though the brightest fell;
2845	Though all things foul would wear the brows of grace,
2846	Yet grace must still look so.
2847	
2848	MACDUFF	I have lost my hopes.
2849	
2850	MALCOLM	Perchance even there where I did find my doubts.
2851	Why in that rawness left you wife and child,
2852	Those precious motives, those strong knots of love,
2853	Without leave-taking? I pray you,
2854	Let not my jealousies be your dishonours,
2855	But mine own safeties. You may be rightly just,
2856	Whatever I shall think.
2857	
2858	MACDUFF	Bleed, bleed, poor country!
2859	Great tyranny! lay thou thy basis sure,
2860	For goodness dare not cheque thee: wear thou
2861	thy wrongs;
2862	The title is affeer'd! Fare thee well, lord:
2863	I would not be the villain that thou think'st
2864	For the whole space that's in the tyrant's grasp,
2865	And the rich East to boot.
2866	
2867	MALCOLM	Be not offended:
2868	I speak not as in absolute fear of you.
2869	I think our country sinks beneath the yoke;
2870	It weeps, it bleeds; and each new day a gash
2871	Is added to her wounds: I think withal
2872	There would be hands uplifted in my right;
2873	And here from gracious England have I offer
2874	Of goodly thousands: but, for all this,
2875	When I shall tread upon the tyrant's head,
2876	Or wear it on my sword, yet my poor country
2877	Shall have more vices than it had before,
2878	More suffer and more sundry ways than ever,
2879	By him that shall succeed.
2880	
2881	MACDUFF	What should he be?
2882	
2883	MALCOLM	It is myself I mean: in whom I know
2884	All the particulars of vice so grafted
2885	That, when they shall be open'd, black Macbeth
2886	Will seem as pure as snow, and the poor state
2887	Esteem him as a lamb, being compared
2888	With my confineless harms.
2889	
2890	MACDUFF	Not in the legions
2891	Of horrid hell can come a devil more damn'd
2892	In evils to top Macbeth.
2893	
2894	MALCOLM	I grant him bloody,
2895	Luxurious, avaricious, false, deceitful,
2896	Sudden, malicious, smacking of every sin
2897	That has a name: but there's no bottom, none,
2898	In my voluptuousness: your wives, your daughters,
2899	Your matrons and your maids, could not fill up
2900	The cistern of my lust, and my desire
2901	All continent impediments would o'erbear
2902	That did oppose my will: better Macbeth
2903	Than such an one to reign.
2904	
2905	MACDUFF	Boundless intemperance
2906	In nature is a tyranny; it hath been
2907	The untimely emptying of the happy throne
2908	And fall of many kings. But fear not yet
2909	To take upon you what is yours: you may
2910	Convey your pleasures in a spacious plenty,
2911	And yet seem cold, the time you may so hoodwink.
2912	We have willing dames enough: there cannot be
2913	That vulture in you, to devour so many
2914	As will to greatness dedicate themselves,
2915	Finding it so inclined.
2916	
2917	MALCOLM	With this there grows
2918	In my most ill-composed affection such
2919	A stanchless avarice that, were I king,
2920	I should cut off the nobles for their lands,
2921	Desire his jewels and this other's house:
2922	And my more-having would be as a sauce
2923	To make me hunger more; that I should forge
2924	Quarrels unjust against the good and loyal,
2925	Destroying them for wealth.
2926	
2927	MACDUFF	This avarice
2928	Sticks deeper, grows with more pernicious root
2929	Than summer-seeming lust, and it hath been
2930	The sword of our slain kings: yet do not fear;
2931	Scotland hath foisons to fill up your will.
2932	Of your mere own: all these are portable,
2933	With other graces weigh'd.
2934	
2935	MALCOLM	But I have none: the king-becoming graces,
2936	As justice, verity, temperance, stableness,
2937	Bounty, perseverance, mercy, lowliness,
2938	Devotion, patience, courage, fortitude,
2939	I have no relish of them, but abound
2940	In the division of each several crime,
2941	Acting it many ways. Nay, had I power, I should
2942	Pour the sweet milk of concord into hell,
2943	Uproar the universal peace, confound
2944	All unity on earth.
2945	
2946	MACDUFF	O Scotland, Scotland!
2947	
2948	MALCOLM	If such a one be fit to govern, speak:
2949	I am as I have spoken.
2950	
2951	MACDUFF	Fit to govern!
2952	No, not to live. O nation miserable,
2953	With an untitled tyrant bloody-scepter'd,
2954	When shalt thou see thy wholesome days again,
2955	Since that the truest issue of thy throne
2956	By his own interdiction stands accursed,
2957	And does blaspheme his breed? Thy royal father
2958	Was a most sainted king: the queen that bore thee,
2959	Oftener upon her knees than on her feet,
2960	Died every day she lived. Fare thee well!
2961	These evils thou repeat'st upon thyself
2962	Have banish'd me from Scotland. O my breast,
2963	Thy hope ends here!
2964	
2965	MALCOLM	Macduff, this noble passion,
2966	Child of integrity, hath from my soul
2967	Wiped the black scruples, reconciled my thoughts
2968	To thy good truth and honour. Devilish Macbeth
2969	By many of these trains hath sought to win me
2970	Into his power, and modest wisdom plucks me
2971	From over-credulous haste: but God above
2972	Deal between thee and me! for even now
2973	I put myself to thy direction, and
2974	Unspeak mine own detraction, here abjure
2975	The taints and blames I laid upon myself,
2976	For strangers to my nature. I am yet
2977	Unknown to woman, never was forsworn,
2978	Scarcely have coveted what was mine own,
2979	At no time broke my faith, would not betray
2980	The devil to his fellow and delight
2981	No less in truth than life: my first false speaking
2982	Was this upon myself: what I am truly,
2983	Is thine and my poor country's to command:
2984	Whither indeed, before thy here-approach,
2985	Old Siward, with ten thousand warlike men,
2986	Already at a point, was setting forth.
2987	Now we'll together; and the chance of goodness
2988	Be like our warranted quarrel! Why are you silent?
2989	
2990	MACDUFF	Such welcome and unwelcome things at once
2991	'Tis hard to reconcile.
2992	
2993	[Enter a Doctor]
2994	
2995	MALCOLM	Well; more anon.--Comes the king forth, I pray you?
2996	
2997	Doctor	Ay, sir; there are a crew of wretched souls
2998	That stay his cure: their malady convinces
2999	The great assay of art; but at his touch--
3000	Such sanctity hath heaven given his hand--
3001	They presently amend.
3002	
3003	MALCOLM	I thank you, doctor.
3004	
3005	[Exit Doctor]
3006	
3007	MACDUFF	What's the disease he means?
3008	
3009	MALCOLM	'Tis call'd the evil:
3010	A most miraculous work in this good king;
3011	Which often, since my here-remain in England,
3012	I have seen him do. How he solicits heaven,
3013	Himself best knows: but strangely-visited people,
3014	All swoln and ulcerous, pitiful to the eye,
3015	The mere despair of surgery, he cures,
3016	Hanging a golden stamp about their necks,
3017	Put on with holy prayers: and 'tis spoken,
3018	To the succeeding royalty he leaves
3019	The healing benediction. With this strange virtue,
3020	He hath a heavenly gift of prophecy,
3021	And sundry blessings hang about his throne,
3022	That speak him full of grace.
3023	
3024	[Enter ROSS]
3025	
3026	MACDUFF	See, who comes here?
3027	
3028	MALCOLM	My countryman; but yet I know him not.
3029	
3030	MACDUFF	My ever-gentle cousin, welcome hither.
3031	
3032	MALCOLM	I know him now. Good God, betimes remove
3033	The means that makes us strangers!
3034	
3035	ROSS	Sir, amen.
3036	
3037	MACDUFF	Stands Scotland where it did?
3038	
3039	ROSS	Alas, poor country!
3040	Almost afraid to know itself. It cannot
3041	Be call'd our mother, but our grave; where nothing,
3042	But who knows nothing, is once seen to smile;
3043	Where sighs and groans and shrieks that rend the air
3044	Are made, not mark'd; where violent sorrow seems
3045	A modern ecstasy; the dead man's knell
3046	Is there scarce ask'd for who; and good men's lives
3047	Expire before the flowers in their caps,
3048	Dying or ere they sicken.
3049	
3050	MACDUFF	O, relation
3051	Too nice, and yet too true!
3052	
3053	MALCOLM	What's the newest grief?
3054	
3055	ROSS	That of an hour's age doth hiss the speaker:
3056	Each minute teems a new one.
3057	
3058	MACDUFF	How does my wife?
3059	
3060	ROSS	Why, well.
3061	
3062	MACDUFF	         And all my children?
3063	
3064	ROSS	Well too.
3065	
3066	MACDUFF	The tyrant has not batter'd at their peace?
3067	
3068	ROSS	No; they were well at peace when I did leave 'em.
3069	
3070	MACDUFF	But not a niggard of your speech: how goes't?
3071	
3072	ROSS	When I came hither to transport the tidings,
3073	Which I have heavily borne, there ran a rumour
3074	Of many worthy fellows that were out;
3075	Which was to my belief witness'd the rather,
3076	For that I saw the tyrant's power a-foot:
3077	Now is the time of help; your eye in Scotland
3078	Would create soldiers, make our women fight,
3079	To doff their dire distresses.
3080	
3081	MALCOLM	Be't their comfort
3082	We are coming thither: gracious England hath
3083	Lent us good Siward and ten thousand men;
3084	An older and a better soldier none
3085	That Christendom gives out.
3086	
3087	ROSS	Would I could answer
3088	This comfort with the like! But I have words
3089	That would be howl'd out in the desert air,
3090	Where hearing should not latch them.
3091	
3092	MACDUFF	What concern they?
3093	The general cause? or is it a fee-grief
3094	Due to some single breast?
3095	
3096	ROSS	No mind that's honest
3097	But in it shares some woe; though the main part
3098	Pertains to you alone.
3099	
3100	MACDUFF	If it be mine,
3101	Keep it not from me, quickly let me have it.
3102	
3103	ROSS	Let not your ears despise my tongue for ever,
3104	Which shall possess them with the heaviest sound
3105	That ever yet they heard.
3106	
3107	MACDUFF	Hum! I guess at it.
3108	
3109	ROSS	Your castle is surprised; your wife and babes
3110	Savagely slaughter'd: to relate the manner,
3111	Were, on the quarry of these murder'd deer,
3112	To add the death of you.
3113	
3114	MALCOLM	Merciful heaven!
3115	What, man! ne'er pull your hat upon your brows;
3116	Give sorrow words: the grief that does not speak
3117	Whispers the o'er-fraught heart and bids it break.
3118	
3119	MACDUFF	My children too?
3120	
3121	ROSS	                  Wife, children, servants, all
3122	That could be found.
3123	
3124	MACDUFF	And I must be from thence!
3125	My wife kill'd too?
3126	
3127	ROSS	I have said.
3128	
3129	MALCOLM	Be comforted:
3130	Let's make us medicines of our great revenge,
3131	To cure this deadly grief.
3132	
3133	MACDUFF	He has no children. All my pretty ones?
3134	Did you say all? O hell-kite! All?
3135	What, all my pretty chickens and their dam
3136	At one fell swoop?
3137	
3138	MALCOLM	Dispute it like a man.
3139	
3140	MACDUFF	I shall do so;
3141	But I must also feel it as a man:
3142	I cannot but remember such things were,
3143	That were most precious to me. Did heaven look on,
3144	And would not take their part? Sinful Macduff,
3145	They were all struck for thee! naught that I am,
3146	Not for their own demerits, but for mine,
3147	Fell slaughter on their souls. Heaven rest them now!
3148	
3149	MALCOLM	Be this the whetstone of your sword: let grief
3150	Convert to anger; blunt not the heart, enrage it.
3151	
3152	MACDUFF	O, I could play the woman with mine eyes
3153	And braggart with my tongue! But, gentle heavens,
3154	Cut short all intermission; front to front
3155	Bring thou this fiend of Scotland and myself;
3156	Within my sword's length set him; if he 'scape,
3157	Heaven forgive him too!
3158	
3159	MALCOLM	This tune goes manly.
3160	Come, go we to the king; our power is ready;
3161	Our lack is nothing but our leave; Macbeth
3162	Is ripe for shaking, and the powers above
3163	Put on their instruments. Receive what cheer you may:
3164	The night is long that never finds the day.

3174	ACT V
3175	
3176	
3177	
3178	SCENE I	Dunsinane. Ante-room in the castle.
3179	
3180	
3181	[Enter a Doctor of Physic and a Waiting-Gentlewoman]
3182	
3183	Doctor	I have two nights watched with you, but can perceive
3184	no truth in your report. When was it she last walked?
3185	
3186	Gentlewoman	Since his majesty went into the field, I have seen
3187	her rise from her bed, throw her night-gown upon
3188	her, unlock her closet, take forth paper, fold it,
3189	write upon't, read it, afterwards seal it, and again
3190	return to bed; yet all this while in a most fast sleep.
3191	
3192	Doctor	A great perturbation in nature, to receive at once
3193	the benefit of sleep, and do the effects of
3194	watching! In this slumbery agitation, besides her
3195	walking and other actual performances, what, at any
3196	time, have you heard her say?
3197	
3198	Gentlewoman	That, sir, which I will not report after her.
3199	
3200	Doctor	You may to me: and 'tis most meet you should.
3201	
3202	Gentlewoman	Neither to you nor any one; having no witness to
3203	confirm my speech.
3204	
3205	[Enter LADY MACBETH, with a taper]
3206	
3207	Lo you, here she comes! This is her very guise;
3208	and, upon my life, fast asleep. Observe her; stand close.
3209	
3210	Doctor	How came she by that light?
3211	
3212	Gentlewoman	Why, it stood by her: she has light by her
3213	continually; 'tis her command.
3214	
3215	Doctor	You see, her eyes are open.
3216	
3217	Gentlewoman	Ay, but their sense is shut.
3218	
3219	Doctor	What is it she does now? Look, how she rubs her hands.
3220	
3221	Gentlewoman	It is an accustomed action with her, to seem thus
3222	washing her hands: I have known her continue in
3223	this a quarter of an hour.
3224	
3225	LADY MACBETH	Yet here's a spot.
3226	
3227	Doctor	Hark! she speaks: I will set down what comes from
3228	her, to satisfy my remembrance the more strongly.
3229	
3230	LADY MACBETH	Out, damned spot! out, I say!--One: two: why,
3231	then, 'tis time to do't.--Hell is murky!--Fie, my
3232	lord, fie! a soldier, and afeard? What need we
3233	fear who knows it, when none can call our power to
3234	account?--Yet who would have thought the old man
3235	to have had so much blood in him.
3236	
3237	Doctor	Do you mark that?
3238	
3239	LADY MACBETH	The thane of Fife had a wife: where is she now?--
3240	What, will these hands ne'er be clean?--No more o'
3241	that, my lord, no more o' that: you mar all with
3242	this starting.
3243	
3244	Doctor	Go to, go to; you have known what you should not.
3245	
3246	Gentlewoman	She has spoke what she should not, I am sure of
3247	that: heaven knows what she has known.
3248	
3249	LADY MACBETH	Here's the smell of the blood still: all the
3250	perfumes of Arabia will not sweeten this little
3251	hand. Oh, oh, oh!
3252	
3253	Doctor	What a sigh is there! The heart is sorely charged.
3254	
3255	Gentlewoman	I would not have such a heart in my bosom for the
3256	dignity of the whole body.
3257	
3258	Doctor	Well, well, well,--
3259	
3260	Gentlewoman	Pray God it be, sir.
3261	
3262	Doctor	This disease is beyond my practise: yet I have known
3263	those which have walked in their sleep who have died
3264	holily in their beds.
3265	
3266	LADY MACBETH	Wash your hands, put on your nightgown; look not so
3267	pale.--I tell you yet again, Banquo's buried; he
3268	cannot come out on's grave.
3269	
3270	Doctor	Even so?
3271	
3272	LADY MACBETH	To bed, to bed! there's knocking at the gate:
3273	come, come, come, come, give me your hand. What's
3274	done cannot be undone.--To bed, to bed, to bed!
3275	
3276	[Exit]
3277	
3278	Doctor	Will she go now to bed?
3279	
3280	Gentlewoman	Directly.
3281	
3282	Doctor	Foul whisperings are abroad: unnatural deeds
3283	Do breed unnatural troubles: infected minds
3284	To their deaf pillows will discharge their secrets:
3285	More needs she the divine than the physician.
3286	God, God forgive us all! Look after her;
3287	Remove from her the means of all annoyance,
3288	And still keep eyes upon her. So, good night:
3289	My mind she has mated, and amazed my sight.
3290	I think, but dare not speak.
3291	
3292	Gentlewoman	Good night, good doctor.

3303	
3304	
3305	SCENE II	The country near Dunsinane.
3306	
3307	
3308	[Drum and colours. Enter MENTEITH, CAITHNESS, ANGUS,
3309	LENNOX, and Soldiers]
3310	
3311	MENTEITH	The English power is near, led on by Malcolm,
3312	His uncle Siward and the good Macduff:
3313	Revenges burn in them; for their dear causes
3314	Would to the bleeding and the grim alarm
3315	Excite the mortified man.
3316	
3317	ANGUS	Near Birnam wood
3318	Shall we well meet them; that way are they coming.
3319	
3320	CAITHNESS	Who knows if Donalbain be with his brother?
3321	
3322	LENNOX	For certain, sir, he is not: I have a file
3323	Of all the gentry: there is Siward's son,
3324	And many unrough youths that even now
3325	Protest their first of manhood.
3326	
3327	MENTEITH	What does the tyrant?
3328	
3329	CAITHNESS	Great Dunsinane he strongly fortifies:
3330	Some say he's mad; others that lesser hate him
3331	Do call it valiant fury: but, for certain,
3332	He cannot buckle his distemper'd cause
3333	Within the belt of rule.
3334	
3335	ANGUS	Now does he feel
3336	His secret murders sticking on his hands;
3337	Now minutely revolts upbraid his faith-breach;
3338	Those he commands move only in command,
3339	Nothing in love: now does he feel his title
3340	Hang loose about him, like a giant's robe
3341	Upon a dwarfish thief.
3342	
3343	MENTEITH	Who then shall blame
3344	His pester'd senses to recoil and start,
3345	When all that is within him does condemn
3346	Itself for being there?
3347	
3348	CAITHNESS	Well, march we on,
3349	To give obedience where 'tis truly owed:
3350	Meet we the medicine of the sickly weal,
3351	And with him pour we in our country's purge
3352	Each drop of us.
3353	
3354	LENNOX	                  Or so much as it needs,
3355	To dew the sovereign flower and drown the weeds.
3356	Make we our march towards Birnam.

3371	
3372	
3373	[Enter MACBETH, Doctor, and Attendants]
3374	
3375	MACBETH	Bring me no more reports; let them fly all:
3376	Till Birnam wood remove to Dunsinane,
3377	I cannot taint with fear. What's the boy Malcolm?
3378	Was he not born of woman? The spirits that know
3379	All mortal consequences have pronounced me thus:
3380	'Fear not, Macbeth; no man that's born of woman
3381	Shall e'er have power upon thee.' Then fly,
3382	false thanes,
3383	And mingle with the English epicures:
3384	The mind I sway by and the heart I bear
3385	Shall never sag with doubt nor shake with fear.
3386	
3387	[Enter a Servant]
3388	
3389	The devil damn thee black, thou cream-faced loon!
3390	Where got'st thou that goose look?
3391	
3392	Servant	There is ten thousand--
3393	
3394	MACBETH	Geese, villain!
3395	
3396	Servant	Soldiers, sir.
3397	
3398	MACBETH	Go prick thy face, and over-red thy fear,
3399	Thou lily-liver'd boy. What soldiers, patch?
3400	Death of thy soul! those linen cheeks of thine
3401	Are counsellors to fear. What soldiers, whey-face?
3402	
3403	Servant	The English force, so please you.
3404	
3405	MACBETH	Take thy face hence.
3406	
3407	[Exit Servant]
3408	
3409	Seyton!--I am sick at heart,
3410	When I behold--Seyton, I say!--This push
3411	Will cheer me ever, or disseat me now.
3412	I have lived long enough: my way of life
3413	Is fall'n into the sear, the yellow leaf;
3414	And that which should accompany old age,
3415	As honour, love, obedience, troops of friends,
3416	I must not look to have; but, in their stead,
3417	Curses, not loud but deep, mouth-honour, breath,
3418	Which the poor heart would fain deny, and dare not. Seyton!
3419	
3420	[Enter SEYTON]
3421	
3422	SEYTON	What is your gracious pleasure?
3423	
3424	MACBETH	What news more?
3425	
3426	SEYTON	All is confirm'd, my lord, which was reported.
3427	
3428	MACBETH	I'll fight till from my bones my flesh be hack'd.
3429	Give me my armour.
3430	
3431	SEYTON	'Tis not needed yet.
3432	
3433	MACBETH	I'll put it on.
3434	Send out more horses; skirr the country round;
3435	Hang those that talk of fear. Give me mine armour.
3436	How does your patient, doctor?
3437	
3438	Doctor	Not so sick, my lord,
3439	As she is troubled with thick coming fancies,
3440	That keep her from her rest.
3441	
3442	MACBETH	Cure her of that.
3443	Canst thou not minister to a mind diseased,
3444	Pluck from the memory a rooted sorrow,
3445	Raze out the written troubles of the brain
3446	And with some sweet oblivious antidote
3447	Cleanse the stuff'd bosom of that perilous stuff
3448	Which weighs upon the heart?
3449	
3450	Doctor	Therein the patient
3451	Must minister to himself.
3452	
3453	MACBETH	Throw physic to the dogs; I'll none of it.
3454	Come, put mine armour on; give me my staff.
3455	Seyton, send out. Doctor, the thanes fly from me.
3456	Come, sir, dispatch. If thou couldst, doctor, cast
3457	The water of my land, find her disease,
3458	And purge it to a sound and pristine health,
3459	I would applaud thee to the very echo,
3460	That should applaud again.--Pull't off, I say.--
3461	What rhubarb, cyme, or what purgative drug,
3462	Would scour these English hence? Hear'st thou of them?
3463	
3464	Doctor	Ay, my good lord; your royal preparation
3465	Makes us hear something.
3466	
3467	MACBETH	Bring it after me.
3468	I will not be afraid of death and bane,
3469	Till Birnam forest come to Dunsinane.
3470	
3471	Doctor	[Aside]  Were I from Dunsinane away and clear,
3472	Profit again should hardly draw me here.

3492	
3493	MALCOLM	Cousins, I hope the days are near at hand
3494	That chambers will be safe.
3495	
3496	MENTEITH	We doubt it nothing.
3497	
3498	SIWARD	What wood is this before us?
3499	
3500	MENTEITH	The wood of Birnam.
3501	
3502	MALCOLM	Let every soldier hew him down a bough
3503	And bear't before him: thereby shall we shadow
3504	The numbers of our host and make discovery
3505	Err in report of us.
3506	
3507	Soldiers	It shall be done.
3508	
3509	SIWARD	We learn no other but the confident tyrant
3510	Keeps still in Dunsinane, and will endure
3511	Our setting down before 't.
3512	
3513	MALCOLM	'Tis his main hope:
3514	For where there is advantage to be given,
3515	Both more and less have given him the revolt,
3516	And none serve with him but constrained things
3517	Whose hearts are absent too.
3518	
3519	MACDUFF	Let our just censures
3520	Attend the true event, and put we on
3521	Industrious soldiership.
3522	
3523	SIWARD	The time approaches
3524	That will with due decision make us know
3525	What we shall say we have and what we owe.
3526	Thoughts speculative their unsure hopes relate,
3527	But certain issue strokes must arbitrate:
3528	Towards which advance the war.

3545	[Enter MACBETH, SEYTON, and Soldiers, with drum
3546	and colours]
3547	
3548	MACBETH	Hang out our banners on the outward walls;
3549	The cry is still 'They come:' our castle's strength
3550	Will laugh a siege to scorn: here let them lie
3551	Till famine and the ague eat them up:
3552	Were they not forced with those that should be ours,
3553	We might have met them dareful, beard to beard,
3554	And beat them backward home.
3555	
3556	[A cry of women within]
3557	
3558	What is that noise?
3559	
3560	SEYTON	It is the cry of women, my good lord.
3561	
3562	[Exit]
3563	
3564	MACBETH	I have almost forgot the taste of fears;
3565	The time has been, my senses would have cool'd
3566	To hear a night-shriek; and my fell of hair
3567	Would at a dismal treatise rouse and stir
3568	As life were in't: I have supp'd full with horrors;
3569	Direness, familiar to my slaughterous thoughts
3570	Cannot once start me.
3571	
3572	[Re-enter SEYTON]
3573	
3574	Wherefore was that cry?
3575	
3576	SEYTON	The queen, my lord, is dead.
3577	
3578	MACBETH	She should have died hereafter;
3579	There would have been a time for such a word.
3580	To-morrow, and to-morrow, and to-morrow,
3581	Creeps in this petty pace from day to day
3582	To the last syllable of recorded time,
3583	And all our yesterdays have lighted fools
3584	The way to dusty death. Out, out, brief candle!
3585	Life's but a walking shadow, a poor player
3586	That struts and frets his hour upon the stage
3587	And then is heard no more: it is a tale
3588	Told by an idiot, full of sound and fury,
3589	Signifying nothing.
3590	
3591	[Enter a Messenger]
3592	
3593	Thou comest to use thy tongue; thy story quickly.
3594	
3595	Messenger	Gracious my lord,
3596	I should report that which I say I saw,
3597	But know not how to do it.
3598	
3599	MACBETH	Well, say, sir.
3600	
3601	Messenger	As I did stand my watch upon the hill,
3602	I look'd toward Birnam, and anon, methought,
3603	The wood began to move.
3604	
3605	MACBETH	Liar and slave!
3606	
3607	Messenger	Let me endure your wrath, if't be not so:
3608	Within this three mile may you see it coming;
3609	I say, a moving grove.
3610	
3611	MACBETH	If thou speak'st false,
3612	Upon the next tree shalt thou hang alive,
3613	Till famine cling thee: if thy speech be sooth,
3614	I care not if thou dost for me as much.
3615	I pull in resolution, and begin
3616	To doubt the equivocation of the fiend
3617	That lies like truth: 'Fear not, till Birnam wood
3618	Do come to Dunsinane:'  and now a wood
3619	Comes toward Dunsinane. Arm, arm, and out!
3620	If this which he avouches does appear,
3621	There is nor flying hence nor tarrying here.
3622	I gin to be aweary of the sun,
3623	And wish the estate o' the world were now undone.
3624	Ring the alarum-bell! Blow, wind! come, wrack!
3625	At least we'll die with harness on our back.

3644	
3645	MALCOLM	Now near enough: your leafy screens throw down.
3646	And show like those you are. You, worthy uncle,
3647	Shall, with my cousin, your right-noble son,
3648	Lead our first battle: worthy Macduff and we
3649	Shall take upon 's what else remains to do,
3650	According to our order.
3651	
3652	SIWARD	Fare you well.
3653	Do we but find the tyrant's power to-night,
3654	Let us be beaten, if we cannot fight.
3655	
3656	MACDUFF	Make all our trumpets speak; give them all breath,

3675	
3676	MACBETH	They have tied me to a stake; I cannot fly,
3677	But, bear-like, I must fight the course. What's he
3678	That was not born of woman? Such a one
3679	Am I to fear, or none.
3680	
3681	[Enter YOUNG SIWARD]
3682	
3683	YOUNG SIWARD	What is thy name?
3684	
3685	MACBETH	                  Thou'lt be afraid to hear it.
3686	
3687	YOUNG SIWARD	No; though thou call'st thyself a hotter name
3688	Than any is in hell.
3689	
3690	MACBETH	My name's Macbeth.
3691	
3692	YOUNG SIWARD	The devil himself could not pronounce a title
3693	More hateful to mine ear.
3694	
3695	MACBETH	No, nor more fearful.
3696	
3697	YOUNG SIWARD	Thou liest, abhorred tyrant; with my sword
3698	I'll prove the lie thou speak'st.
3699	
3700	[They fight and YOUNG SIWARD is slain]
3701	
3702	MACBETH	Thou wast born of woman
3703	But swords I smile at, weapons laugh to scorn,
3704	Brandish'd by man that's of a woman born.
3705	
3706	[Exit]
3707	
3708	[Alarums. Enter MACDUFF]
3709	
3710	MACDUFF	That way the noise is. Tyrant, show thy face!
3711	If thou be'st slain and with no stroke of mine,
3712	My wife and children's ghosts will haunt me still.
3713	I cannot strike at wretched kerns, whose arms
3714	Are hired to bear their staves: either thou, Macbeth,
3715	Or else my sword with an unbatter'd edge
3716	I sheathe again undeeded. There thou shouldst be;
3717	By this great clatter, one of greatest note
3718	Seems bruited. Let me find him, fortune!
3719	And more I beg not.
3720	
3721	[Exit. Alarums]
3722	
3723	[Enter MALCOLM and SIWARD]
3724	
3725	SIWARD	This way, my lord; the castle's gently render'd:
3726	The tyrant's people on both sides do fight;
3727	The noble thanes do bravely in the war;
3728	The day almost itself professes yours,
3729	And little is to do.
3730	
3731	MALCOLM	We have met with foes
3732	That strike beside us.

3752	
3753	MACBETH	Why should I play the Roman fool, and die
3754	On mine own sword? whiles I see lives, the gashes
3755	Do better upon them.
3756	
3757	[Enter MACDUFF]
3758	
3759	MACDUFF	Turn, hell-hound, turn!
3760	
3761	MACBETH	Of all men else I have avoided thee:
3762	But get thee back; my soul is too much charged
3763	With blood of thine already.
3764	
3765	MACDUFF	I have no words:
3766	My voice is in my sword: thou bloodier villain
3767	Than terms can give thee out!
3768	
3769	[They fight]
3770	
3771	MACBETH	Thou losest labour:
3772	As easy mayst thou the intrenchant air
3773	With thy keen sword impress as make me bleed:
3774	Let fall thy blade on vulnerable crests;
3775	I bear a charmed life, which must not yield,
3776	To one of woman born.
3777	
3778	MACDUFF	Despair thy charm;
3779	And let the angel whom thou still hast served
3780	Tell thee, Macduff was from his mother's womb
3781	Untimely ripp'd.
3782	
3783	MACBETH	Accursed be that tongue that tells me so,
3784	For it hath cow'd my better part of man!
3785	And be these juggling fiends no more believed,
3786	That palter with us in a double sense;
3787	That keep the word of promise to our ear,
3788	And break it to our hope. I'll not fight with thee.
3789	
3790	MACDUFF	Then yield thee, coward,
3791	And live to be the show and gaze o' the time:
3792	We'll have thee, as our rarer monsters are,
3793	Painted on a pole, and underwrit,
3794	'Here may you see the tyrant.'
3795	
3796	MACBETH	I will not yield,
3797	To kiss the ground before young Malcolm's feet,
3798	And to be baited with the rabble's curse.
3799	Though Birnam wood be come to Dunsinane,
3800	And thou opposed, being of no woman born,
3801	Yet I will try the last. Before my body
3802	I throw my warlike shield. Lay on, Macduff,
3803	And damn'd be him that first cries, 'Hold, enough!'
3804	
3805	[Exeunt, fighting. Alarums]

3809	
3810	MALCOLM	I would the friends we miss were safe arrived.
3811	
3812	SIWARD	Some must go off: and yet, by these I see,
3813	So great a day as this is cheaply bought.
3814	
3815	MALCOLM	Macduff is missing, and your noble son.
3816	
3817	ROSS	Your son, my lord, has paid a soldier's debt:
3818	He only lived but till he was a man;
3819	The which no sooner had his prowess confirm'd
3820	In the unshrinking station where he fought,
3821	But like a man he died.
3822	
3823	SIWARD	Then he is dead?
3824	
3825	ROSS	Ay, and brought off the field: your cause of sorrow
3826	Must not be measured by his worth, for then
3827	It hath no end.
3828	
3829	SIWARD	                  Had he his hurts before?
3830	
3831	ROSS	Ay, on the front.
3832	
3833	SIWARD	                  Why then, God's soldier be he!
3834	Had I as many sons as I have hairs,
3835	I would not wish them to a fairer death:
3836	And so, his knell is knoll'd.
3837	
3838	MALCOLM	He's worth more sorrow,
3839	And that I'll spend for him.
3840	
3841	SIWARD	He's worth no more
3842	They say he parted well, and paid his score:
3843	And so, God be with him! Here comes newer comfort.
3844	
3845	[Re-enter MACDUFF, with MACBETH's head]
3846	
3847	MACDUFF	Hail, king! for so thou art: behold, where stands
3848	The usurper's cursed head: the time is free:
3849	I see thee compass'd with thy kingdom's pearl,
3850	That speak my salutation in their minds;
3851	Whose voices I desire aloud with mine:
3852	Hail, King of Scotland!
3853	
3854	ALL	Hail, King of Scotland!
3855	
3856	[Flourish]
3857	
3858	MALCOLM	We shall not spend a large expense of time
3859	Before we reckon with your several loves,
3860	And make us even with you. My thanes and kinsmen,
3861	Henceforth be earls, the first that ever Scotland
3862	In such an honour named. What's more to do,
3863	Which would be planted newly with the time,
3864	As calling home our exiled friends abroad
3865	That fled the snares of watchful tyranny;
3866	Producing forth the cruel ministers
3867	Of this dead butcher and his fiend-like queen,
3868	Who, as 'tis thought, by self and violent hands
3869	Took off her life; this, and what needful else
3870	That calls upon us, by the grace of Grace,
3871	We will perform in measure, time and place:
3872	So, thanks to all at once and to each one,
3873	Whom we invite to see us crown'd at Scone.
3874	
3875	[Flourish. Exeunt]

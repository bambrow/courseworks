90	ACT I
91	
92	
93	
94	SCENE I	London. KING RICHARD II's palace.
95	
96	
97	[Enter KING RICHARD II, JOHN OF GAUNT, with other
98	Nobles and Attendants]
99	
100	KING RICHARD II	Old John of Gaunt, time-honour'd Lancaster,
101	Hast thou, according to thy oath and band,
102	Brought hither Henry Hereford thy bold son,
103	Here to make good the boisterous late appeal,
104	Which then our leisure would not let us hear,
105	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
106	
107	JOHN OF GAUNT	I have, my liege.
108	
109	KING RICHARD II	Tell me, moreover, hast thou sounded him,
110	If he appeal the duke on ancient malice;
111	Or worthily, as a good subject should,
112	On some known ground of treachery in him?
113	
114	JOHN OF GAUNT	As near as I could sift him on that argument,
115	On some apparent danger seen in him
116	Aim'd at your highness, no inveterate malice.
117	
118	KING RICHARD II	Then call them to our presence; face to face,
119	And frowning brow to brow, ourselves will hear
120	The accuser and the accused freely speak:
121	High-stomach'd are they both, and full of ire,
122	In rage deaf as the sea, hasty as fire.
123	
124	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE and THOMAS MOWBRAY]
125	
126	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Many years of happy days befal
127	My gracious sovereign, my most loving liege!
128	
129	THOMAS MOWBRAY	Each day still better other's happiness;
130	Until the heavens, envying earth's good hap,
131	Add an immortal title to your crown!
132	
133	KING RICHARD II	We thank you both: yet one but flatters us,
134	As well appeareth by the cause you come;
135	Namely to appeal each other of high treason.
136	Cousin of Hereford, what dost thou object
137	Against the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray?
138	
139	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	First, heaven be the record to my speech!
140	In the devotion of a subject's love,
141	Tendering the precious safety of my prince,
142	And free from other misbegotten hate,
143	Come I appellant to this princely presence.
144	Now, Thomas Mowbray, do I turn to thee,
145	And mark my greeting well; for what I speak
146	My body shall make good upon this earth,
147	Or my divine soul answer it in heaven.
148	Thou art a traitor and a miscreant,
149	Too good to be so and too bad to live,
150	Since the more fair and crystal is the sky,
151	The uglier seem the clouds that in it fly.
152	Once more, the more to aggravate the note,
153	With a foul traitor's name stuff I thy throat;
154	And wish, so please my sovereign, ere I move,
155	What my tongue speaks my right drawn sword may prove.
156	
157	THOMAS MOWBRAY	Let not my cold words here accuse my zeal:
158	'Tis not the trial of a woman's war,
159	The bitter clamour of two eager tongues,
160	Can arbitrate this cause betwixt us twain;
161	The blood is hot that must be cool'd for this:
162	Yet can I not of such tame patience boast
163	As to be hush'd and nought at all to say:
164	First, the fair reverence of your highness curbs me
165	From giving reins and spurs to my free speech;
166	Which else would post until it had return'd
167	These terms of treason doubled down his throat.
168	Setting aside his high blood's royalty,
169	And let him be no kinsman to my liege,
170	I do defy him, and I spit at him;
171	Call him a slanderous coward and a villain:
172	Which to maintain I would allow him odds,
173	And meet him, were I tied to run afoot
174	Even to the frozen ridges of the Alps,
175	Or any other ground inhabitable,
176	Where ever Englishman durst set his foot.
177	Mean time let this defend my loyalty,
178	By all my hopes, most falsely doth he lie.
179	
180	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Pale trembling coward, there I throw my gage,
181	Disclaiming here the kindred of the king,
182	And lay aside my high blood's royalty,
183	Which fear, not reverence, makes thee to except.
184	If guilty dread have left thee so much strength
185	As to take up mine honour's pawn, then stoop:
186	By that and all the rites of knighthood else,
187	Will I make good against thee, arm to arm,
188	What I have spoke, or thou canst worse devise.
189	
190	THOMAS MOWBRAY	I take it up; and by that sword I swear
191	Which gently laid my knighthood on my shoulder,
192	I'll answer thee in any fair degree,
193	Or chivalrous design of knightly trial:
194	And when I mount, alive may I not light,
195	If I be traitor or unjustly fight!
196	
197	KING RICHARD II	What doth our cousin lay to Mowbray's charge?
198	It must be great that can inherit us
199	So much as of a thought of ill in him.
200	
201	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Look, what I speak, my life shall prove it true;
202	That Mowbray hath received eight thousand nobles
203	In name of lendings for your highness' soldiers,
204	The which he hath detain'd for lewd employments,
205	Like a false traitor and injurious villain.
206	Besides I say and will in battle prove,
207	Or here or elsewhere to the furthest verge
208	That ever was survey'd by English eye,
209	That all the treasons for these eighteen years
210	Complotted and contrived in this land
211	Fetch from false Mowbray their first head and spring.
212	Further I say and further will maintain
213	Upon his bad life to make all this good,
214	That he did plot the Duke of Gloucester's death,
215	Suggest his soon-believing adversaries,
216	And consequently, like a traitor coward,
217	Sluiced out his innocent soul through streams of blood:
218	Which blood, like sacrificing Abel's, cries,
219	Even from the tongueless caverns of the earth,
220	To me for justice and rough chastisement;
221	And, by the glorious worth of my descent,
222	This arm shall do it, or this life be spent.
223	
224	KING RICHARD II	How high a pitch his resolution soars!
225	Thomas of Norfolk, what say'st thou to this?
226	
227	THOMAS MOWBRAY	O, let my sovereign turn away his face
228	And bid his ears a little while be deaf,
229	Till I have told this slander of his blood,
230	How God and good men hate so foul a liar.
231	
232	KING RICHARD II	Mowbray, impartial are our eyes and ears:
233	Were he my brother, nay, my kingdom's heir,
234	As he is but my father's brother's son,
235	Now, by my sceptre's awe, I make a vow,
236	Such neighbour nearness to our sacred blood
237	Should nothing privilege him, nor partialize
238	The unstooping firmness of my upright soul:
239	He is our subject, Mowbray; so art thou:
240	Free speech and fearless I to thee allow.
241	
242	THOMAS MOWBRAY	Then, Bolingbroke, as low as to thy heart,
243	Through the false passage of thy throat, thou liest.
244	Three parts of that receipt I had for Calais
245	Disbursed I duly to his highness' soldiers;
246	The other part reserved I by consent,
247	For that my sovereign liege was in my debt
248	Upon remainder of a dear account,
249	Since last I went to France to fetch his queen:
250	Now swallow down that lie. For Gloucester's death,
251	I slew him not; but to my own disgrace
252	Neglected my sworn duty in that case.
253	For you, my noble Lord of Lancaster,
254	The honourable father to my foe
255	Once did I lay an ambush for your life,
256	A trespass that doth vex my grieved soul
257	But ere I last received the sacrament
258	I did confess it, and exactly begg'd
259	Your grace's pardon, and I hope I had it.
260	This is my fault: as for the rest appeall'd,
261	It issues from the rancour of a villain,
262	A recreant and most degenerate traitor
263	Which in myself I boldly will defend;
264	And interchangeably hurl down my gage
265	Upon this overweening traitor's foot,
266	To prove myself a loyal gentleman
267	Even in the best blood chamber'd in his bosom.
268	In haste whereof, most heartily I pray
269	Your highness to assign our trial day.
270	
271	KING RICHARD II	Wrath-kindled gentlemen, be ruled by me;
272	Let's purge this choler without letting blood:
273	This we prescribe, though no physician;
274	Deep malice makes too deep incision;
275	Forget, forgive; conclude and be agreed;
276	Our doctors say this is no month to bleed.
277	Good uncle, let this end where it begun;
278	We'll calm the Duke of Norfolk, you your son.
279	
280	JOHN OF GAUNT	To be a make-peace shall become my age:
281	Throw down, my son, the Duke of Norfolk's gage.
282	
283	KING RICHARD II	And, Norfolk, throw down his.
284	
285	JOHN OF GAUNT	When, Harry, when?
286	Obedience bids I should not bid again.
287	
288	KING RICHARD II	Norfolk, throw down, we bid; there is no boot.
289	
290	THOMAS MOWBRAY	Myself I throw, dread sovereign, at thy foot.
291	My life thou shalt command, but not my shame:
292	The one my duty owes; but my fair name,
293	Despite of death that lives upon my grave,
294	To dark dishonour's use thou shalt not have.
295	I am disgraced, impeach'd and baffled here,
296	Pierced to the soul with slander's venom'd spear,
297	The which no balm can cure but his heart-blood
298	Which breathed this poison.
299	
300	KING RICHARD II	Rage must be withstood:
301	Give me his gage: lions make leopards tame.
302	
303	THOMAS MOWBRAY	Yea, but not change his spots: take but my shame.
304	And I resign my gage. My dear dear lord,
305	The purest treasure mortal times afford
306	Is spotless reputation: that away,
307	Men are but gilded loam or painted clay.
308	A jewel in a ten-times-barr'd-up chest
309	Is a bold spirit in a loyal breast.
310	Mine honour is my life; both grow in one:
311	Take honour from me, and my life is done:
312	Then, dear my liege, mine honour let me try;
313	In that I live and for that will I die.
314	
315	KING RICHARD II	Cousin, throw up your gage; do you begin.
316	
317	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O, God defend my soul from such deep sin!
318	Shall I seem crest-fall'n in my father's sight?
319	Or with pale beggar-fear impeach my height
320	Before this out-dared dastard? Ere my tongue
321	Shall wound my honour with such feeble wrong,
322	Or sound so base a parle, my teeth shall tear
323	The slavish motive of recanting fear,
324	And spit it bleeding in his high disgrace,
325	Where shame doth harbour, even in Mowbray's face.
326	
327	[Exit JOHN OF GAUNT]
328	
329	KING RICHARD II	We were not born to sue, but to command;
330	Which since we cannot do to make you friends,
331	Be ready, as your lives shall answer it,
332	At Coventry, upon Saint Lambert's day:
333	There shall your swords and lances arbitrate
334	The swelling difference of your settled hate:
335	Since we can not atone you, we shall see
336	Justice design the victor's chivalry.
337	Lord marshal, command our officers at arms
338	Be ready to direct these home alarms.

350	
351	
352	SCENE II	The DUKE OF LANCASTER'S palace.
353	
354	
355	[Enter JOHN OF GAUNT with DUCHESS]
356	
357	JOHN OF GAUNT	Alas, the part I had in Woodstock's blood
358	Doth more solicit me than your exclaims,
359	To stir against the butchers of his life!
360	But since correction lieth in those hands
361	Which made the fault that we cannot correct,
362	Put we our quarrel to the will of heaven;
363	Who, when they see the hours ripe on earth,
364	Will rain hot vengeance on offenders' heads.
365	
366	DUCHESS	Finds brotherhood in thee no sharper spur?
367	Hath love in thy old blood no living fire?
368	Edward's seven sons, whereof thyself art one,
369	Were as seven vials of his sacred blood,
370	Or seven fair branches springing from one root:
371	Some of those seven are dried by nature's course,
372	Some of those branches by the Destinies cut;
373	But Thomas, my dear lord, my life, my Gloucester,
374	One vial full of Edward's sacred blood,
375	One flourishing branch of his most royal root,
376	Is crack'd, and all the precious liquor spilt,
377	Is hack'd down, and his summer leaves all faded,
378	By envy's hand and murder's bloody axe.
379	Ah, Gaunt, his blood was thine! that bed, that womb,
380	That metal, that self-mould, that fashion'd thee
381	Made him a man; and though thou livest and breathest,
382	Yet art thou slain in him: thou dost consent
383	In some large measure to thy father's death,
384	In that thou seest thy wretched brother die,
385	Who was the model of thy father's life.
386	Call it not patience, Gaunt; it is despair:
387	In suffering thus thy brother to be slaughter'd,
388	Thou showest the naked pathway to thy life,
389	Teaching stern murder how to butcher thee:
390	That which in mean men we intitle patience
391	Is pale cold cowardice in noble breasts.
392	What shall I say? to safeguard thine own life,
393	The best way is to venge my Gloucester's death.
394	
395	JOHN OF GAUNT	God's is the quarrel; for God's substitute,
396	His deputy anointed in His sight,
397	Hath caused his death: the which if wrongfully,
398	Let heaven revenge; for I may never lift
399	An angry arm against His minister.
400	
401	DUCHESS	Where then, alas, may I complain myself?
402	
403	JOHN OF GAUNT	To God, the widow's champion and defence.
404	
405	DUCHESS	Why, then, I will. Farewell, old Gaunt.
406	Thou goest to Coventry, there to behold
407	Our cousin Hereford and fell Mowbray fight:
408	O, sit my husband's wrongs on Hereford's spear,
409	That it may enter butcher Mowbray's breast!
410	Or, if misfortune miss the first career,
411	Be Mowbray's sins so heavy in his bosom,
412	They may break his foaming courser's back,
413	And throw the rider headlong in the lists,
414	A caitiff recreant to my cousin Hereford!
415	Farewell, old Gaunt: thy sometimes brother's wife
416	With her companion grief must end her life.
417	
418	JOHN OF GAUNT	Sister, farewell; I must to Coventry:
419	As much good stay with thee as go with me!
420	
421	DUCHESS	Yet one word more: grief boundeth where it falls,
422	Not with the empty hollowness, but weight:
423	I take my leave before I have begun,
424	For sorrow ends not when it seemeth done.
425	Commend me to thy brother, Edmund York.
426	Lo, this is all:--nay, yet depart not so;
427	Though this be all, do not so quickly go;
428	I shall remember more. Bid him--ah, what?--
429	With all good speed at Plashy visit me.
430	Alack, and what shall good old York there see
431	But empty lodgings and unfurnish'd walls,
432	Unpeopled offices, untrodden stones?
433	And what hear there for welcome but my groans?
434	Therefore commend me; let him not come there,
435	To seek out sorrow that dwells every where.
436	Desolate, desolate, will I hence and die:
437	The last leave of thee takes my weeping eye.

455	
456	Lord Marshal	My Lord Aumerle, is Harry Hereford arm'd?
457	
458	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, at all points; and longs to enter in.
459	
460	Lord Marshal	The Duke of Norfolk, sprightfully and bold,
461	Stays but the summons of the appellant's trumpet.
462	
463	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Why, then, the champions are prepared, and stay
464	For nothing but his majesty's approach.
465	
466	[The trumpets sound, and KING RICHARD enters with
467	his nobles, JOHN OF GAUNT, BUSHY, BAGOT, GREEN, and
468	others. When they are set, enter THOMAS MOWBRAY in
469	arms, defendant, with a Herald]
470	
471	KING RICHARD II	Marshal, demand of yonder champion
472	The cause of his arrival here in arms:
473	Ask him his name and orderly proceed
474	To swear him in the justice of his cause.
475	
476	Lord Marshal	In God's name and the king's, say who thou art
477	And why thou comest thus knightly clad in arms,
478	Against what man thou comest, and what thy quarrel:
479	Speak truly, on thy knighthood and thy oath;
480	As so defend thee heaven and thy valour!
481	
482	THOMAS MOWBRAY	My name is Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk;
483	Who hither come engaged by my oath--
484	Which God defend a knight should violate!--
485	Both to defend my loyalty and truth
486	To God, my king and my succeeding issue,
487	Against the Duke of Hereford that appeals me
488	And, by the grace of God and this mine arm,
489	To prove him, in defending of myself,
490	A traitor to my God, my king, and me:
491	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
492	
493	[The trumpets sound. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
494	appellant, in armour, with a Herald]
495	
496	KING RICHARD II	Marshal, ask yonder knight in arms,
497	Both who he is and why he cometh hither
498	Thus plated in habiliments of war,
499	And formally, according to our law,
500	Depose him in the justice of his cause.
501	
502	Lord Marshal	What is thy name? and wherefore comest thou hither,
503	Before King Richard in his royal lists?
504	Against whom comest thou? and what's thy quarrel?
505	Speak like a true knight, so defend thee heaven!
506	
507	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby
508	Am I; who ready here do stand in arms,
509	To prove, by God's grace and my body's valour,
510	In lists, on Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
511	That he is a traitor, foul and dangerous,
512	To God of heaven, King Richard and to me;
513	And as I truly fight, defend me heaven!
514	
515	Lord Marshal	On pain of death, no person be so bold
516	Or daring-hardy as to touch the lists,
517	Except the marshal and such officers
518	Appointed to direct these fair designs.
519	
520	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Lord marshal, let me kiss my sovereign's hand,
521	And bow my knee before his majesty:
522	For Mowbray and myself are like two men
523	That vow a long and weary pilgrimage;
524	Then let us take a ceremonious leave
525	And loving farewell of our several friends.
526	
527	Lord Marshal	The appellant in all duty greets your highness,
528	And craves to kiss your hand and take his leave.
529	
530	KING RICHARD II	We will descend and fold him in our arms.
531	Cousin of Hereford, as thy cause is right,
532	So be thy fortune in this royal fight!
533	Farewell, my blood; which if to-day thou shed,
534	Lament we may, but not revenge thee dead.
535	
536	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O let no noble eye profane a tear
537	For me, if I be gored with Mowbray's spear:
538	As confident as is the falcon's flight
539	Against a bird, do I with Mowbray fight.
540	My loving lord, I take my leave of you;
541	Of you, my noble cousin, Lord Aumerle;
542	Not sick, although I have to do with death,
543	But lusty, young, and cheerly drawing breath.
544	Lo, as at English feasts, so I regreet
545	The daintiest last, to make the end most sweet:
546	O thou, the earthly author of my blood,
547	Whose youthful spirit, in me regenerate,
548	Doth with a twofold vigour lift me up
549	To reach at victory above my head,
550	Add proof unto mine armour with thy prayers;
551	And with thy blessings steel my lance's point,
552	That it may enter Mowbray's waxen coat,
553	And furbish new the name of John a Gaunt,
554	Even in the lusty havior of his son.
555	
556	JOHN OF GAUNT	God in thy good cause make thee prosperous!
557	Be swift like lightning in the execution;
558	And let thy blows, doubly redoubled,
559	Fall like amazing thunder on the casque
560	Of thy adverse pernicious enemy:
561	Rouse up thy youthful blood, be valiant and live.
562	
563	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Mine innocency and Saint George to thrive!
564	
565	THOMAS MOWBRAY	However God or fortune cast my lot,
566	There lives or dies, true to King Richard's throne,
567	A loyal, just and upright gentleman:
568	Never did captive with a freer heart
569	Cast off his chains of bondage and embrace
570	His golden uncontroll'd enfranchisement,
571	More than my dancing soul doth celebrate
572	This feast of battle with mine adversary.
573	Most mighty liege, and my companion peers,
574	Take from my mouth the wish of happy years:
575	As gentle and as jocund as to jest
576	Go I to fight: truth hath a quiet breast.
577	
578	KING RICHARD II	Farewell, my lord: securely I espy
579	Virtue with valour couched in thine eye.
580	Order the trial, marshal, and begin.
581	
582	Lord Marshal	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
583	Receive thy lance; and God defend the right!
584	
585	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Strong as a tower in hope, I cry amen.
586	
587	Lord Marshal	Go bear this lance to Thomas, Duke of Norfolk.
588	
589	First Herald	Harry of Hereford, Lancaster and Derby,
590	Stands here for God, his sovereign and himself,
591	On pain to be found false and recreant,
592	To prove the Duke of Norfolk, Thomas Mowbray,
593	A traitor to his God, his king and him;
594	And dares him to set forward to the fight.
595	
596	Second Herald	Here standeth Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk,
597	On pain to be found false and recreant,
598	Both to defend himself and to approve
599	Henry of Hereford, Lancaster, and Derby,
600	To God, his sovereign and to him disloyal;
601	Courageously and with a free desire
602	Attending but the signal to begin.
603	
604	Lord Marshal	Sound, trumpets; and set forward, combatants.
605	
606	[A charge sounded]
607	
608	Stay, the king hath thrown his warder down.
609	
610	KING RICHARD II	Let them lay by their helmets and their spears,
611	And both return back to their chairs again:
612	Withdraw with us: and let the trumpets sound
613	While we return these dukes what we decree.
614	
615	[A long flourish]
616	
617	Draw near,
618	And list what with our council we have done.
619	For that our kingdom's earth should not be soil'd
620	With that dear blood which it hath fostered;
621	And for our eyes do hate the dire aspect
622	Of civil wounds plough'd up with neighbours' sword;
623	And for we think the eagle-winged pride
624	Of sky-aspiring and ambitious thoughts,
625	With rival-hating envy, set on you
626	To wake our peace, which in our country's cradle
627	Draws the sweet infant breath of gentle sleep;
628	Which so roused up with boisterous untuned drums,
629	With harsh resounding trumpets' dreadful bray,
630	And grating shock of wrathful iron arms,
631	Might from our quiet confines fright fair peace
632	And make us wade even in our kindred's blood,
633	Therefore, we banish you our territories:
634	You, cousin Hereford, upon pain of life,
635	Till twice five summers have enrich'd our fields
636	Shall not regreet our fair dominions,
637	But tread the stranger paths of banishment.
638	
639	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Your will be done: this must my comfort be,
640	Sun that warms you here shall shine on me;
641	And those his golden beams to you here lent
642	Shall point on me and gild my banishment.
643	
644	KING RICHARD II	Norfolk, for thee remains a heavier doom,
645	Which I with some unwillingness pronounce:
646	The sly slow hours shall not determinate
647	The dateless limit of thy dear exile;
648	The hopeless word of 'never to return'
649	Breathe I against thee, upon pain of life.
650	
651	THOMAS MOWBRAY	A heavy sentence, my most sovereign liege,
652	And all unlook'd for from your highness' mouth:
653	A dearer merit, not so deep a maim
654	As to be cast forth in the common air,
655	Have I deserved at your highness' hands.
656	The language I have learn'd these forty years,
657	My native English, now I must forego:
658	And now my tongue's use is to me no more
659	Than an unstringed viol or a harp,
660	Or like a cunning instrument cased up,
661	Or, being open, put into his hands
662	That knows no touch to tune the harmony:
663	Within my mouth you have engaol'd my tongue,
664	Doubly portcullis'd with my teeth and lips;
665	And dull unfeeling barren ignorance
666	Is made my gaoler to attend on me.
667	I am too old to fawn upon a nurse,
668	Too far in years to be a pupil now:
669	What is thy sentence then but speechless death,
670	Which robs my tongue from breathing native breath?
671	
672	KING RICHARD II	It boots thee not to be compassionate:
673	After our sentence plaining comes too late.
674	
675	THOMAS MOWBRAY	Then thus I turn me from my country's light,
676	To dwell in solemn shades of endless night.
677	
678	KING RICHARD II	Return again, and take an oath with thee.
679	Lay on our royal sword your banish'd hands;
680	Swear by the duty that you owe to God--
681	Our part therein we banish with yourselves--
682	To keep the oath that we administer:
683	You never shall, so help you truth and God!
684	Embrace each other's love in banishment;
685	Nor never look upon each other's face;
686	Nor never write, regreet, nor reconcile
687	This louring tempest of your home-bred hate;
688	Nor never by advised purpose meet
689	To plot, contrive, or complot any ill
690	'Gainst us, our state, our subjects, or our land.
691	
692	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I swear.
693	
694	THOMAS MOWBRAY	And I, to keep all this.
695	
696	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Norfolk, so far as to mine enemy:--
697	By this time, had the king permitted us,
698	One of our souls had wander'd in the air.
699	Banish'd this frail sepulchre of our flesh,
700	As now our flesh is banish'd from this land:
701	Confess thy treasons ere thou fly the realm;
702	Since thou hast far to go, bear not along
703	The clogging burthen of a guilty soul.
704	
705	THOMAS MOWBRAY	No, Bolingbroke: if ever I were traitor,
706	My name be blotted from the book of life,
707	And I from heaven banish'd as from hence!
708	But what thou art, God, thou, and I do know;
709	And all too soon, I fear, the king shall rue.
710	Farewell, my liege. Now no way can I stray;
711	Save back to England, all the world's my way.
712	
713	[Exit]
714	
715	KING RICHARD II	Uncle, even in the glasses of thine eyes
716	I see thy grieved heart: thy sad aspect
717	Hath from the number of his banish'd years
718	Pluck'd four away.
719	
720	[To HENRY BOLINGBROKE]
721	
722	Six frozen winter spent,
723	Return with welcome home from banishment.
724	
725	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How long a time lies in one little word!
726	Four lagging winters and four wanton springs
727	End in a word: such is the breath of kings.
728	
729	JOHN OF GAUNT	I thank my liege, that in regard of me
730	He shortens four years of my son's exile:
731	But little vantage shall I reap thereby;
732	For, ere the six years that he hath to spend
733	Can change their moons and bring their times about
734	My oil-dried lamp and time-bewasted light
735	Shall be extinct with age and endless night;
736	My inch of taper will be burnt and done,
737	And blindfold death not let me see my son.
738	
739	KING RICHARD II	Why uncle, thou hast many years to live.
740	
741	JOHN OF GAUNT	But not a minute, king, that thou canst give:
742	Shorten my days thou canst with sullen sorrow,
743	And pluck nights from me, but not lend a morrow;
744	Thou canst help time to furrow me with age,
745	But stop no wrinkle in his pilgrimage;
746	Thy word is current with him for my death,
747	But dead, thy kingdom cannot buy my breath.
748	
749	KING RICHARD II	Thy son is banish'd upon good advice,
750	Whereto thy tongue a party-verdict gave:
751	Why at our justice seem'st thou then to lour?
752	
753	JOHN OF GAUNT	Things sweet to taste prove in digestion sour.
754	You urged me as a judge; but I had rather
755	You would have bid me argue like a father.
756	O, had it been a stranger, not my child,
757	To smooth his fault I should have been more mild:
758	A partial slander sought I to avoid,
759	And in the sentence my own life destroy'd.
760	Alas, I look'd when some of you should say,
761	I was too strict to make mine own away;
762	But you gave leave to my unwilling tongue
763	Against my will to do myself this wrong.
764	
765	KING RICHARD II	Cousin, farewell; and, uncle, bid him so:
766	Six years we banish him, and he shall go.
767	
768	[Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II and train]
769	
770	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Cousin, farewell: what presence must not know,
771	From where you do remain let paper show.
772	
773	Lord Marshal	My lord, no leave take I; for I will ride,
774	As far as land will let me, by your side.
775	
776	JOHN OF GAUNT	O, to what purpose dost thou hoard thy words,
777	That thou return'st no greeting to thy friends?
778	
779	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I have too few to take my leave of you,
780	When the tongue's office should be prodigal
781	To breathe the abundant dolour of the heart.
782	
783	JOHN OF GAUNT	Thy grief is but thy absence for a time.
784	
785	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Joy absent, grief is present for that time.
786	
787	JOHN OF GAUNT	What is six winters? they are quickly gone.
788	
789	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	To men in joy; but grief makes one hour ten.
790	
791	JOHN OF GAUNT	Call it a travel that thou takest for pleasure.
792	
793	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My heart will sigh when I miscall it so,
794	Which finds it an inforced pilgrimage.
795	
796	JOHN OF GAUNT	The sullen passage of thy weary steps
797	Esteem as foil wherein thou art to set
798	The precious jewel of thy home return.
799	
800	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Nay, rather, every tedious stride I make
801	Will but remember me what a deal of world
802	I wander from the jewels that I love.
803	Must I not serve a long apprenticehood
804	To foreign passages, and in the end,
805	Having my freedom, boast of nothing else
806	But that I was a journeyman to grief?
807	
808	JOHN OF GAUNT	All places that the eye of heaven visits
809	Are to a wise man ports and happy havens.
810	Teach thy necessity to reason thus;
811	There is no virtue like necessity.
812	Think not the king did banish thee,
813	But thou the king. Woe doth the heavier sit,
814	Where it perceives it is but faintly borne.
815	Go, say I sent thee forth to purchase honour
816	And not the king exiled thee; or suppose
817	Devouring pestilence hangs in our air
818	And thou art flying to a fresher clime:
819	Look, what thy soul holds dear, imagine it
820	To lie that way thou go'st, not whence thou comest:
821	Suppose the singing birds musicians,
822	The grass whereon thou tread'st the presence strew'd,
823	The flowers fair ladies, and thy steps no more
824	Than a delightful measure or a dance;
825	For gnarling sorrow hath less power to bite
826	The man that mocks at it and sets it light.
827	
828	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O, who can hold a fire in his hand
829	By thinking on the frosty Caucasus?
830	Or cloy the hungry edge of appetite
831	By bare imagination of a feast?
832	Or wallow naked in December snow
833	By thinking on fantastic summer's heat?
834	O, no! the apprehension of the good
835	Gives but the greater feeling to the worse:
836	Fell sorrow's tooth doth never rankle more
837	Than when he bites, but lanceth not the sore.
838	
839	JOHN OF GAUNT	Come, come, my son, I'll bring thee on thy way:
840	Had I thy youth and cause, I would not stay.
841	
842	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Then, England's ground, farewell; sweet soil, adieu;
843	My mother, and my nurse, that bears me yet!
844	Where'er I wander, boast of this I can,
845	Though banish'd, yet a trueborn Englishman.

858	
859	SCENE IV	The court.
860	
861	
862	[Enter KING RICHARD II, with BAGOT and GREEN at one
863	door; and the DUKE OF AUMERLE at another]
864	
865	KING RICHARD II	We did observe. Cousin Aumerle,
866	How far brought you high Hereford on his way?
867	
868	DUKE OF AUMERLE	I brought high Hereford, if you call him so,
869	But to the next highway, and there I left him.
870	
871	KING RICHARD II	And say, what store of parting tears were shed?
872	
873	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Faith, none for me; except the north-east wind,
874	Which then blew bitterly against our faces,
875	Awaked the sleeping rheum, and so by chance
876	Did grace our hollow parting with a tear.
877	
878	KING RICHARD II	What said our cousin when you parted with him?
879	
880	DUKE OF AUMERLE	'Farewell:'
881	And, for my heart disdained that my tongue
882	Should so profane the word, that taught me craft
883	To counterfeit oppression of such grief
884	That words seem'd buried in my sorrow's grave.
885	Marry, would the word 'farewell' have lengthen'd hours
886	And added years to his short banishment,
887	He should have had a volume of farewells;
888	But since it would not, he had none of me.
889	
890	KING RICHARD II	He is our cousin, cousin; but 'tis doubt,
891	When time shall call him home from banishment,
892	Whether our kinsman come to see his friends.
893	Ourself and Bushy, Bagot here and Green
894	Observed his courtship to the common people;
895	How he did seem to dive into their hearts
896	With humble and familiar courtesy,
897	What reverence he did throw away on slaves,
898	Wooing poor craftsmen with the craft of smiles
899	And patient underbearing of his fortune,
900	As 'twere to banish their affects with him.
901	Off goes his bonnet to an oyster-wench;
902	A brace of draymen bid God speed him well
903	And had the tribute of his supple knee,
904	With 'Thanks, my countrymen, my loving friends;'
905	As were our England in reversion his,
906	And he our subjects' next degree in hope.
907	
908	GREEN	Well, he is gone; and with him go these thoughts.
909	Now for the rebels which stand out in Ireland,
910	Expedient manage must be made, my liege,
911	Ere further leisure yield them further means
912	For their advantage and your highness' loss.
913	
914	KING RICHARD II	We will ourself in person to this war:
915	And, for our coffers, with too great a court
916	And liberal largess, are grown somewhat light,
917	We are inforced to farm our royal realm;
918	The revenue whereof shall furnish us
919	For our affairs in hand: if that come short,
920	Our substitutes at home shall have blank charters;
921	Whereto, when they shall know what men are rich,
922	They shall subscribe them for large sums of gold
923	And send them after to supply our wants;
924	For we will make for Ireland presently.
925	
926	[Enter BUSHY]
927	
928	Bushy, what news?
929	
930	BUSHY	Old John of Gaunt is grievous sick, my lord,
931	Suddenly taken; and hath sent post haste
932	To entreat your majesty to visit him.
933	
934	KING RICHARD II	Where lies he?
935	
936	BUSHY	At Ely House.
937	
938	KING RICHARD II	Now put it, God, in the physician's mind
939	To help him to his grave immediately!
940	The lining of his coffers shall make coats
941	To deck our soldiers for these Irish wars.
942	Come, gentlemen, let's all go visit him:
943	Pray God we may make haste, and come too late!
944	
945	All	Amen.

960	
961	
962	[Enter JOHN OF GAUNT sick, with the DUKE OF YORK,
963	&c]
964	
965	JOHN OF GAUNT	Will the king come, that I may breathe my last
966	In wholesome counsel to his unstaid youth?
967	
968	DUKE OF YORK	Vex not yourself, nor strive not with your breath;
969	For all in vain comes counsel to his ear.
970	
971	JOHN OF GAUNT	O, but they say the tongues of dying men
972	Enforce attention like deep harmony:
973	Where words are scarce, they are seldom spent in vain,
974	For they breathe truth that breathe their words in pain.
975	He that no more must say is listen'd more
976	Than they whom youth and ease have taught to glose;
977	More are men's ends mark'd than their lives before:
978	The setting sun, and music at the close,
979	As the last taste of sweets, is sweetest last,
980	Writ in remembrance more than things long past:
981	Though Richard my life's counsel would not hear,
982	My death's sad tale may yet undeaf his ear.
983	
984	DUKE OF YORK	No; it is stopp'd with other flattering sounds,
985	As praises, of whose taste the wise are fond,
986	Lascivious metres, to whose venom sound
987	The open ear of youth doth always listen;
988	Report of fashions in proud Italy,
989	Whose manners still our tardy apish nation
990	Limps after in base imitation.
991	Where doth the world thrust forth a vanity--
992	So it be new, there's no respect how vile--
993	That is not quickly buzzed into his ears?
994	Then all too late comes counsel to be heard,
995	Where will doth mutiny with wit's regard.
996	Direct not him whose way himself will choose:
997	'Tis breath thou lack'st, and that breath wilt thou lose.
998	
999	JOHN OF GAUNT	Methinks I am a prophet new inspired
1000	And thus expiring do foretell of him:
1001	His rash fierce blaze of riot cannot last,
1002	For violent fires soon burn out themselves;
1003	Small showers last long, but sudden storms are short;
1004	He tires betimes that spurs too fast betimes;
1005	With eager feeding food doth choke the feeder:
1006	Light vanity, insatiate cormorant,
1007	Consuming means, soon preys upon itself.
1008	This royal throne of kings, this scepter'd isle,
1009	This earth of majesty, this seat of Mars,
1010	This other Eden, demi-paradise,
1011	This fortress built by Nature for herself
1012	Against infection and the hand of war,
1013	This happy breed of men, this little world,
1014	This precious stone set in the silver sea,
1015	Which serves it in the office of a wall,
1016	Or as a moat defensive to a house,
1017	Against the envy of less happier lands,
1018	This blessed plot, this earth, this realm, this England,
1019	This nurse, this teeming womb of royal kings,
1020	Fear'd by their breed and famous by their birth,
1021	Renowned for their deeds as far from home,
1022	For Christian service and true chivalry,
1023	As is the sepulchre in stubborn Jewry,
1024	Of the world's ransom, blessed Mary's Son,
1025	This land of such dear souls, this dear dear land,
1026	Dear for her reputation through the world,
1027	Is now leased out, I die pronouncing it,
1028	Like to a tenement or pelting farm:
1029	England, bound in with the triumphant sea
1030	Whose rocky shore beats back the envious siege
1031	Of watery Neptune, is now bound in with shame,
1032	With inky blots and rotten parchment bonds:
1033	That England, that was wont to conquer others,
1034	Hath made a shameful conquest of itself.
1035	Ah, would the scandal vanish with my life,
1036	How happy then were my ensuing death!
1037	
1038	[Enter KING RICHARD II and QUEEN, DUKE OF AUMERLE,
1039	BUSHY, GREEN, BAGOT, LORD ROSS, and LORD
1040	WILLOUGHBY]
1041	
1042	DUKE OF YORK	The king is come: deal mildly with his youth;
1043	For young hot colts being raged do rage the more.
1044	
1045	QUEEN	How fares our noble uncle, Lancaster?
1046	
1047	KING RICHARD II	What comfort, man? how is't with aged Gaunt?
1048	
1049	JOHN OF GAUNT	O how that name befits my composition!
1050	Old Gaunt indeed, and gaunt in being old:
1051	Within me grief hath kept a tedious fast;
1052	And who abstains from meat that is not gaunt?
1053	For sleeping England long time have I watch'd;
1054	Watching breeds leanness, leanness is all gaunt:
1055	The pleasure that some fathers feed upon,
1056	Is my strict fast; I mean, my children's looks;
1057	And therein fasting, hast thou made me gaunt:
1058	Gaunt am I for the grave, gaunt as a grave,
1059	Whose hollow womb inherits nought but bones.
1060	
1061	KING RICHARD II	Can sick men play so nicely with their names?
1062	
1063	JOHN OF GAUNT	No, misery makes sport to mock itself:
1064	Since thou dost seek to kill my name in me,
1065	I mock my name, great king, to flatter thee.
1066	
1067	KING RICHARD II	Should dying men flatter with those that live?
1068	
1069	JOHN OF GAUNT	No, no, men living flatter those that die.
1070	
1071	KING RICHARD II	Thou, now a-dying, say'st thou flatterest me.
1072	
1073	JOHN OF GAUNT	O, no! thou diest, though I the sicker be.
1074	
1075	KING RICHARD II	I am in health, I breathe, and see thee ill.
1076	
1077	JOHN OF GAUNT	Now He that made me knows I see thee ill;
1078	Ill in myself to see, and in thee seeing ill.
1079	Thy death-bed is no lesser than thy land
1080	Wherein thou liest in reputation sick;
1081	And thou, too careless patient as thou art,
1082	Commit'st thy anointed body to the cure
1083	Of those physicians that first wounded thee:
1084	A thousand flatterers sit within thy crown,
1085	Whose compass is no bigger than thy head;
1086	And yet, incaged in so small a verge,
1087	The waste is no whit lesser than thy land.
1088	O, had thy grandsire with a prophet's eye
1089	Seen how his son's son should destroy his sons,
1090	From forth thy reach he would have laid thy shame,
1091	Deposing thee before thou wert possess'd,
1092	Which art possess'd now to depose thyself.
1093	Why, cousin, wert thou regent of the world,
1094	It were a shame to let this land by lease;
1095	But for thy world enjoying but this land,
1096	Is it not more than shame to shame it so?
1097	Landlord of England art thou now, not king:
1098	Thy state of law is bondslave to the law; And thou--
1099	
1100	KING RICHARD II	         A lunatic lean-witted fool,
1101	Presuming on an ague's privilege,
1102	Darest with thy frozen admonition
1103	Make pale our cheek, chasing the royal blood
1104	With fury from his native residence.
1105	Now, by my seat's right royal majesty,
1106	Wert thou not brother to great Edward's son,
1107	This tongue that runs so roundly in thy head
1108	Should run thy head from thy unreverent shoulders.
1109	
1110	JOHN OF GAUNT	O, spare me not, my brother Edward's son,
1111	For that I was his father Edward's son;
1112	That blood already, like the pelican,
1113	Hast thou tapp'd out and drunkenly caroused:
1114	My brother Gloucester, plain well-meaning soul,
1115	Whom fair befal in heaven 'mongst happy souls!
1116	May be a precedent and witness good
1117	That thou respect'st not spilling Edward's blood:
1118	Join with the present sickness that I have;
1119	And thy unkindness be like crooked age,
1120	To crop at once a too long wither'd flower.
1121	Live in thy shame, but die not shame with thee!
1122	These words hereafter thy tormentors be!
1123	Convey me to my bed, then to my grave:
1124	Love they to live that love and honour have.
1125	
1126	[Exit, borne off by his Attendants]
1127	
1128	KING RICHARD II	And let them die that age and sullens have;
1129	For both hast thou, and both become the grave.
1130	
1131	DUKE OF YORK	I do beseech your majesty, impute his words
1132	To wayward sickliness and age in him:
1133	He loves you, on my life, and holds you dear
1134	As Harry Duke of Hereford, were he here.
1135	
1136	KING RICHARD II	Right, you say true: as Hereford's love, so his;
1137	As theirs, so mine; and all be as it is.
1138	
1139	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]
1140	
1141	NORTHUMBERLAND	My liege, old Gaunt commends him to your majesty.
1142	
1143	KING RICHARD II	What says he?
1144	
1145	NORTHUMBERLAND	                  Nay, nothing; all is said
1146	His tongue is now a stringless instrument;
1147	Words, life and all, old Lancaster hath spent.
1148	
1149	DUKE OF YORK	Be York the next that must be bankrupt so!
1150	Though death be poor, it ends a mortal woe.
1151	
1152	KING RICHARD II	The ripest fruit first falls, and so doth he;
1153	His time is spent, our pilgrimage must be.
1154	So much for that. Now for our Irish wars:
1155	We must supplant those rough rug-headed kerns,
1156	Which live like venom where no venom else
1157	But only they have privilege to live.
1158	And for these great affairs do ask some charge,
1159	Towards our assistance we do seize to us
1160	The plate, corn, revenues and moveables,
1161	Whereof our uncle Gaunt did stand possess'd.
1162	
1163	DUKE OF YORK	How long shall I be patient? ah, how long
1164	Shall tender duty make me suffer wrong?
1165	Not Gloucester's death, nor Hereford's banishment
1166	Not Gaunt's rebukes, nor England's private wrongs,
1167	Nor the prevention of poor Bolingbroke
1168	About his marriage, nor my own disgrace,
1169	Have ever made me sour my patient cheek,
1170	Or bend one wrinkle on my sovereign's face.
1171	I am the last of noble Edward's sons,
1172	Of whom thy father, Prince of Wales, was first:
1173	In war was never lion raged more fierce,
1174	In peace was never gentle lamb more mild,
1175	Than was that young and princely gentleman.
1176	His face thou hast, for even so look'd he,
1177	Accomplish'd with the number of thy hours;
1178	But when he frown'd, it was against the French
1179	And not against his friends; his noble hand
1180	Did will what he did spend and spent not that
1181	Which his triumphant father's hand had won;
1182	His hands were guilty of no kindred blood,
1183	But bloody with the enemies of his kin.
1184	O Richard! York is too far gone with grief,
1185	Or else he never would compare between.
1186	
1187	KING RICHARD II	Why, uncle, what's the matter?
1188	
1189	DUKE OF YORK	O my liege,
1190	Pardon me, if you please; if not, I, pleased
1191	Not to be pardon'd, am content withal.
1192	Seek you to seize and gripe into your hands
1193	The royalties and rights of banish'd Hereford?
1194	Is not Gaunt dead, and doth not Hereford live?
1195	Was not Gaunt just, and is not Harry true?
1196	Did not the one deserve to have an heir?
1197	Is not his heir a well-deserving son?
1198	Take Hereford's rights away, and take from Time
1199	His charters and his customary rights;
1200	Let not to-morrow then ensue to-day;
1201	Be not thyself; for how art thou a king
1202	But by fair sequence and succession?
1203	Now, afore God--God forbid I say true!--
1204	If you do wrongfully seize Hereford's rights,
1205	Call in the letters patent that he hath
1206	By his attorneys-general to sue
1207	His livery, and deny his offer'd homage,
1208	You pluck a thousand dangers on your head,
1209	You lose a thousand well-disposed hearts
1210	And prick my tender patience, to those thoughts
1211	Which honour and allegiance cannot think.
1212	
1213	KING RICHARD II	Think what you will, we seize into our hands
1214	His plate, his goods, his money and his lands.
1215	
1216	DUKE OF YORK	I'll not be by the while: my liege, farewell:
1217	What will ensue hereof, there's none can tell;
1218	But by bad courses may be understood
1219	That their events can never fall out good.
1220	
1221	[Exit]
1222	
1223	KING RICHARD II	Go, Bushy, to the Earl of Wiltshire straight:
1224	Bid him repair to us to Ely House
1225	To see this business. To-morrow next
1226	We will for Ireland; and 'tis time, I trow:
1227	And we create, in absence of ourself,
1228	Our uncle York lord governor of England;
1229	For he is just and always loved us well.
1230	Come on, our queen: to-morrow must we part;
1231	Be merry, for our time of stay is short
1232	
1233	[Flourish. Exeunt KING RICHARD II, QUEEN, DUKE OF
1234	AUMERLE, BUSHY, GREEN, and BAGOT]
1235	
1236	NORTHUMBERLAND	Well, lords, the Duke of Lancaster is dead.
1237	
1238	LORD ROSS	And living too; for now his son is duke.
1239	
1240	LORD WILLOUGHBY	Barely in title, not in revenue.
1241	
1242	NORTHUMBERLAND	Richly in both, if justice had her right.
1243	
1244	LORD ROSS	My heart is great; but it must break with silence,
1245	Ere't be disburden'd with a liberal tongue.
1246	
1247	NORTHUMBERLAND	Nay, speak thy mind; and let him ne'er speak more
1248	That speaks thy words again to do thee harm!
1249	
1250	LORD WILLOUGHBY	Tends that thou wouldst speak to the Duke of Hereford?
1251	If it be so, out with it boldly, man;
1252	Quick is mine ear to hear of good towards him.
1253	
1254	LORD ROSS	No good at all that I can do for him;
1255	Unless you call it good to pity him,
1256	Bereft and gelded of his patrimony.
1257	
1258	NORTHUMBERLAND	Now, afore God, 'tis shame such wrongs are borne
1259	In him, a royal prince, and many moe
1260	Of noble blood in this declining land.
1261	The king is not himself, but basely led
1262	By flatterers; and what they will inform,
1263	Merely in hate, 'gainst any of us all,
1264	That will the king severely prosecute
1265	'Gainst us, our lives, our children, and our heirs.
1266	
1267	LORD ROSS	The commons hath he pill'd with grievous taxes,
1268	And quite lost their hearts: the nobles hath he fined
1269	For ancient quarrels, and quite lost their hearts.
1270	
1271	LORD WILLOUGHBY	And daily new exactions are devised,
1272	As blanks, benevolences, and I wot not what:
1273	But what, o' God's name, doth become of this?
1274	
1275	NORTHUMBERLAND	Wars have not wasted it, for warr'd he hath not,
1276	But basely yielded upon compromise
1277	That which his noble ancestors achieved with blows:
1278	More hath he spent in peace than they in wars.
1279	
1280	LORD ROSS	The Earl of Wiltshire hath the realm in farm.
1281	
1282	LORD WILLOUGHBY	The king's grown bankrupt, like a broken man.
1283	
1284	NORTHUMBERLAND	Reproach and dissolution hangeth over him.
1285	
1286	LORD ROSS	He hath not money for these Irish wars,
1287	His burthenous taxations notwithstanding,
1288	But by the robbing of the banish'd duke.
1289	
1290	NORTHUMBERLAND	His noble kinsman: most degenerate king!
1291	But, lords, we hear this fearful tempest sing,
1292	Yet see no shelter to avoid the storm;
1293	We see the wind sit sore upon our sails,
1294	And yet we strike not, but securely perish.
1295	
1296	LORD ROSS	We see the very wreck that we must suffer;
1297	And unavoided is the danger now,
1298	For suffering so the causes of our wreck.
1299	
1300	NORTHUMBERLAND	Not so; even through the hollow eyes of death
1301	I spy life peering; but I dare not say
1302	How near the tidings of our comfort is.
1303	
1304	LORD WILLOUGHBY	Nay, let us share thy thoughts, as thou dost ours.
1305	
1306	LORD ROSS	Be confident to speak, Northumberland:
1307	We three are but thyself; and, speaking so,
1308	Thy words are but as thoughts; therefore, be bold.
1309	
1310	NORTHUMBERLAND	Then thus: I have from Port le Blanc, a bay
1311	In Brittany, received intelligence
1312	That Harry Duke of Hereford, Rainold Lord Cobham,
1313	[                                               ]
1314	That late broke from the Duke of Exeter,
1315	His brother, Archbishop late of Canterbury,
1316	Sir Thomas Erpingham, Sir John Ramston,
1317	Sir John Norbery, Sir Robert Waterton and Francis Quoint,
1318	All these well furnish'd by the Duke of Bretagne
1319	With eight tall ships, three thousand men of war,
1320	Are making hither with all due expedience
1321	And shortly mean to touch our northern shore:
1322	Perhaps they had ere this, but that they stay
1323	The first departing of the king for Ireland.
1324	If then we shall shake off our slavish yoke,
1325	Imp out our drooping country's broken wing,
1326	Redeem from broking pawn the blemish'd crown,
1327	Wipe off the dust that hides our sceptre's gilt
1328	And make high majesty look like itself,
1329	Away with me in post to Ravenspurgh;
1330	But if you faint, as fearing to do so,
1331	Stay and be secret, and myself will go.
1332	
1333	LORD ROSS	To horse, to horse! urge doubts to them that fear.
1334	
1335	LORD WILLOUGHBY	Hold out my horse, and I will first be there.
1336	
1337	[Exeunt]

1342	KING RICHARD II
1343	
1344	
1345	ACT II
1346	
1347	
1348	
1349	SCENE II	The palace.
1350	
1351	
1352	[Enter QUEEN, BUSHY, and BAGOT]
1353	
1354	BUSHY	Madam, your majesty is too much sad:
1355	You promised, when you parted with the king,
1356	To lay aside life-harming heaviness
1357	And entertain a cheerful disposition.
1358	
1359	QUEEN	To please the king I did; to please myself
1360	I cannot do it; yet I know no cause
1361	Why I should welcome such a guest as grief,
1362	Save bidding farewell to so sweet a guest
1363	As my sweet Richard: yet again, methinks,
1364	Some unborn sorrow, ripe in fortune's womb,
1365	Is coming towards me, and my inward soul
1366	With nothing trembles: at some thing it grieves,
1367	More than with parting from my lord the king.
1368	
1369	BUSHY	Each substance of a grief hath twenty shadows,
1370	Which shows like grief itself, but is not so;
1371	For sorrow's eye, glazed with blinding tears,
1372	Divides one thing entire to many objects;
1373	Like perspectives, which rightly gazed upon
1374	Show nothing but confusion, eyed awry
1375	Distinguish form: so your sweet majesty,
1376	Looking awry upon your lord's departure,
1377	Find shapes of grief, more than himself, to wail;
1378	Which, look'd on as it is, is nought but shadows
1379	Of what it is not. Then, thrice-gracious queen,
1380	More than your lord's departure weep not: more's not seen;
1381	Or if it be, 'tis with false sorrow's eye,
1382	Which for things true weeps things imaginary.
1383	
1384	QUEEN	It may be so; but yet my inward soul
1385	Persuades me it is otherwise: howe'er it be,
1386	I cannot but be sad; so heavy sad
1387	As, though on thinking on no thought I think,
1388	Makes me with heavy nothing faint and shrink.
1389	
1390	BUSHY	'Tis nothing but conceit, my gracious lady.
1391	
1392	QUEEN	'Tis nothing less: conceit is still derived
1393	From some forefather grief; mine is not so,
1394	For nothing had begot my something grief;
1395	Or something hath the nothing that I grieve:
1396	'Tis in reversion that I do possess;
1397	But what it is, that is not yet known; what
1398	I cannot name; 'tis nameless woe, I wot.
1399	
1400	[Enter GREEN]
1401	
1402	GREEN	God save your majesty! and well met, gentlemen:
1403	I hope the king is not yet shipp'd for Ireland.
1404	
1405	QUEEN	Why hopest thou so? 'tis better hope he is;
1406	For his designs crave haste, his haste good hope:
1407	Then wherefore dost thou hope he is not shipp'd?
1408	
1409	GREEN	That he, our hope, might have retired his power,
1410	And driven into despair an enemy's hope,
1411	Who strongly hath set footing in this land:
1412	The banish'd Bolingbroke repeals himself,
1413	And with uplifted arms is safe arrived
1414	At Ravenspurgh.
1415	
1416	QUEEN	                  Now God in heaven forbid!
1417	
1418	GREEN	Ah, madam, 'tis too true: and that is worse,
1419	The Lord Northumberland, his son young Henry Percy,
1420	The Lords of Ross, Beaumond, and Willoughby,
1421	With all their powerful friends, are fled to him.
1422	
1423	BUSHY	Why have you not proclaim'd Northumberland
1424	And all the rest revolted faction traitors?
1425	
1426	GREEN	We have: whereupon the Earl of Worcester
1427	Hath broke his staff, resign'd his stewardship,
1428	And all the household servants fled with him
1429	To Bolingbroke.
1430	
1431	QUEEN	So, Green, thou art the midwife to my woe,
1432	And Bolingbroke my sorrow's dismal heir:
1433	Now hath my soul brought forth her prodigy,
1434	And I, a gasping new-deliver'd mother,
1435	Have woe to woe, sorrow to sorrow join'd.
1436	
1437	BUSHY	Despair not, madam.
1438	
1439	QUEEN	Who shall hinder me?
1440	I will despair, and be at enmity
1441	With cozening hope: he is a flatterer,
1442	A parasite, a keeper back of death,
1443	Who gently would dissolve the bands of life,
1444	Which false hope lingers in extremity.
1445	
1446	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]
1447	
1448	GREEN	Here comes the Duke of York.
1449	
1450	QUEEN	With signs of war about his aged neck:
1451	O, full of careful business are his looks!
1452	Uncle, for God's sake, speak comfortable words.
1453	
1454	DUKE OF YORK	Should I do so, I should belie my thoughts:
1455	Comfort's in heaven; and we are on the earth,
1456	Where nothing lives but crosses, cares and grief.
1457	Your husband, he is gone to save far off,
1458	Whilst others come to make him lose at home:
1459	Here am I left to underprop his land,
1460	Who, weak with age, cannot support myself:
1461	Now comes the sick hour that his surfeit made;
1462	Now shall he try his friends that flatter'd him.
1463	
1464	[Enter a Servant]
1465	
1466	Servant	My lord, your son was gone before I came.
1467	
1468	DUKE OF YORK	He was? Why, so! go all which way it will!
1469	The nobles they are fled, the commons they are cold,
1470	And will, I fear, revolt on Hereford's side.
1471	Sirrah, get thee to Plashy, to my sister Gloucester;
1472	Bid her send me presently a thousand pound:
1473	Hold, take my ring.
1474	
1475	Servant	My lord, I had forgot to tell your lordship,
1476	To-day, as I came by, I called there;
1477	But I shall grieve you to report the rest.
1478	
1479	DUKE OF YORK	What is't, knave?
1480	
1481	Servant	An hour before I came, the duchess died.
1482	
1483	DUKE OF YORK	God for his mercy! what a tide of woes
1484	Comes rushing on this woeful land at once!
1485	I know not what to do: I would to God,
1486	So my untruth had not provoked him to it,
1487	The king had cut off my head with my brother's.
1488	What, are there no posts dispatch'd for Ireland?
1489	How shall we do for money for these wars?
1490	Come, sister,--cousin, I would say--pray, pardon me.
1491	Go, fellow, get thee home, provide some carts
1492	And bring away the armour that is there.
1493	
1494	[Exit Servant]
1495	
1496	Gentlemen, will you go muster men?
1497	If I know how or which way to order these affairs
1498	Thus thrust disorderly into my hands,
1499	Never believe me. Both are my kinsmen:
1500	The one is my sovereign, whom both my oath
1501	And duty bids defend; the other again
1502	Is my kinsman, whom the king hath wrong'd,
1503	Whom conscience and my kindred bids to right.
1504	Well, somewhat we must do. Come, cousin, I'll
1505	Dispose of you.
1506	Gentlemen, go, muster up your men,
1507	And meet me presently at Berkeley.
1508	I should to Plashy too;
1509	But time will not permit: all is uneven,
1510	And every thing is left at six and seven.
1511	
1512	[Exeunt DUKE OF YORK and QUEEN]
1513	
1514	BUSHY	The wind sits fair for news to go to Ireland,
1515	But none returns. For us to levy power
1516	Proportionable to the enemy
1517	Is all unpossible.
1518	
1519	GREEN	Besides, our nearness to the king in love
1520	Is near the hate of those love not the king.
1521	
1522	BAGOT	And that's the wavering commons: for their love
1523	Lies in their purses, and whoso empties them
1524	By so much fills their hearts with deadly hate.
1525	
1526	BUSHY	Wherein the king stands generally condemn'd.
1527	
1528	BAGOT	If judgement lie in them, then so do we,
1529	Because we ever have been near the king.
1530	
1531	GREEN	Well, I will for refuge straight to Bristol castle:
1532	The Earl of Wiltshire is already there.
1533	
1534	BUSHY	Thither will I with you; for little office
1535	The hateful commons will perform for us,
1536	Except like curs to tear us all to pieces.
1537	Will you go along with us?
1538	
1539	BAGOT	No; I will to Ireland to his majesty.
1540	Farewell: if heart's presages be not vain,
1541	We three here art that ne'er shall meet again.
1542	
1543	BUSHY	That's as York thrives to beat back Bolingbroke.
1544	
1545	GREEN	Alas, poor duke! the task he undertakes
1546	Is numbering sands and drinking oceans dry:
1547	Where one on his side fights, thousands will fly.
1548	Farewell at once, for once, for all, and ever.
1549	
1550	BUSHY	Well, we may meet again.
1551	
1552	BAGOT	I fear me, never.

1571	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	How far is it, my lord, to Berkeley now?
1572	
1573	NORTHUMBERLAND	Believe me, noble lord,
1574	I am a stranger here in Gloucestershire:
1575	These high wild hills and rough uneven ways
1576	Draws out our miles, and makes them wearisome,
1577	And yet your fair discourse hath been as sugar,
1578	Making the hard way sweet and delectable.
1579	But I bethink me what a weary way
1580	From Ravenspurgh to Cotswold will be found
1581	In Ross and Willoughby, wanting your company,
1582	Which, I protest, hath very much beguiled
1583	The tediousness and process of my travel:
1584	But theirs is sweetened with the hope to have
1585	The present benefit which I possess;
1586	And hope to joy is little less in joy
1587	Than hope enjoy'd: by this the weary lords
1588	Shall make their way seem short, as mine hath done
1589	By sight of what I have, your noble company.
1590	
1591	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Of much less value is my company
1592	Than your good words. But who comes here?
1593	
1594	[Enter HENRY PERCY]
1595	
1596	NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my son, young Harry Percy,
1597	Sent from my brother Worcester, whencesoever.
1598	Harry, how fares your uncle?
1599	
1600	HENRY PERCY	I had thought, my lord, to have learn'd his health of you.
1601	
1602	NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, is he not with the queen?
1603	
1604	HENRY PERCY	No, my good Lord; he hath forsook the court,
1605	Broken his staff of office and dispersed
1606	The household of the king.
1607	
1608	NORTHUMBERLAND	What was his reason?
1609	He was not so resolved when last we spake together.
1610	
1611	HENRY PERCY	Because your lordship was proclaimed traitor.
1612	But he, my lord, is gone to Ravenspurgh,
1613	To offer service to the Duke of Hereford,
1614	And sent me over by Berkeley, to discover
1615	What power the Duke of York had levied there;
1616	Then with directions to repair to Ravenspurgh.
1617	
1618	NORTHUMBERLAND	Have you forgot the Duke of Hereford, boy?
1619	
1620	HENRY PERCY	No, my good lord, for that is not forgot
1621	Which ne'er I did remember: to my knowledge,
1622	I never in my life did look on him.
1623	
1624	NORTHUMBERLAND	Then learn to know him now; this is the duke.
1625	
1626	HENRY PERCY	My gracious lord, I tender you my service,
1627	Such as it is, being tender, raw and young:
1628	Which elder days shall ripen and confirm
1629	To more approved service and desert.
1630	
1631	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thank thee, gentle Percy; and be sure
1632	I count myself in nothing else so happy
1633	As in a soul remembering my good friends;
1634	And, as my fortune ripens with thy love,
1635	It shall be still thy true love's recompense:
1636	My heart this covenant makes, my hand thus seals it.
1637	
1638	NORTHUMBERLAND	How far is it to Berkeley? and what stir
1639	Keeps good old York there with his men of war?
1640	
1641	HENRY PERCY	There stands the castle, by yon tuft of trees,
1642	Mann'd with three hundred men, as I have heard;
1643	And in it are the Lords of York, Berkeley, and Seymour;
1644	None else of name and noble estimate.
1645	
1646	[Enter LORD ROSS and LORD WILLOUGHBY]
1647	
1648	NORTHUMBERLAND	Here come the Lords of Ross and Willoughby,
1649	Bloody with spurring, fiery-red with haste.
1650	
1651	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Welcome, my lords. I wot your love pursues
1652	A banish'd traitor: all my treasury
1653	Is yet but unfelt thanks, which more enrich'd
1654	Shall be your love and labour's recompense.
1655	
1656	LORD ROSS	Your presence makes us rich, most noble lord.
1657	
1658	LORD WILLOUGHBY	And far surmounts our labour to attain it.
1659	
1660	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Evermore thanks, the exchequer of the poor;
1661	Which, till my infant fortune comes to years,
1662	Stands for my bounty. But who comes here?
1663	
1664	[Enter LORD BERKELEY]
1665	
1666	NORTHUMBERLAND	It is my Lord of Berkeley, as I guess.
1667	
1668	LORD BERKELEY	My Lord of Hereford, my message is to you.
1669	
1670	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My lord, my answer is--to Lancaster;
1671	And I am come to seek that name in England;
1672	And I must find that title in your tongue,
1673	Before I make reply to aught you say.
1674	
1675	LORD BERKELEY	Mistake me not, my lord; 'tis not my meaning
1676	To raze one title of your honour out:
1677	To you, my lord, I come, what lord you will,
1678	From the most gracious regent of this land,
1679	The Duke of York, to know what pricks you on
1680	To take advantage of the absent time
1681	And fright our native peace with self-born arms.
1682	
1683	[Enter DUKE OF YORK attended]
1684	
1685	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I shall not need transport my words by you;
1686	Here comes his grace in person. My noble uncle!
1687	
1688	[Kneels]
1689	
1690	DUKE OF YORK	Show me thy humble heart, and not thy knee,
1691	Whose duty is deceiveable and false.
1692	
1693	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle--
1694	
1695	DUKE OF YORK	Tut, tut!
1696	Grace me no grace, nor uncle me no uncle:
1697	I am no traitor's uncle; and that word 'grace.'
1698	In an ungracious mouth is but profane.
1699	Why have those banish'd and forbidden legs
1700	Dared once to touch a dust of England's ground?
1701	But then more 'why?' why have they dared to march
1702	So many miles upon her peaceful bosom,
1703	Frighting her pale-faced villages with war
1704	And ostentation of despised arms?
1705	Comest thou because the anointed king is hence?
1706	Why, foolish boy, the king is left behind,
1707	And in my loyal bosom lies his power.
1708	Were I but now the lord of such hot youth
1709	As when brave Gaunt, thy father, and myself
1710	Rescued the Black Prince, that young Mars of men,
1711	From forth the ranks of many thousand French,
1712	O, then how quickly should this arm of mine.
1713	Now prisoner to the palsy, chastise thee
1714	And minister correction to thy fault!
1715	
1716	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious uncle, let me know my fault:
1717	On what condition stands it and wherein?
1718	
1719	DUKE OF YORK	Even in condition of the worst degree,
1720	In gross rebellion and detested treason:
1721	Thou art a banish'd man, and here art come
1722	Before the expiration of thy time,
1723	In braving arms against thy sovereign.
1724	
1725	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As I was banish'd, I was banish'd Hereford;
1726	But as I come, I come for Lancaster.
1727	And, noble uncle, I beseech your grace
1728	Look on my wrongs with an indifferent eye:
1729	You are my father, for methinks in you
1730	I see old Gaunt alive; O, then, my father,
1731	Will you permit that I shall stand condemn'd
1732	A wandering vagabond; my rights and royalties
1733	Pluck'd from my arms perforce and given away
1734	To upstart unthrifts? Wherefore was I born?
1735	If that my cousin king be King of England,
1736	It must be granted I am Duke of Lancaster.
1737	You have a son, Aumerle, my noble cousin;
1738	Had you first died, and he been thus trod down,
1739	He should have found his uncle Gaunt a father,
1740	To rouse his wrongs and chase them to the bay.
1741	I am denied to sue my livery here,
1742	And yet my letters-patents give me leave:
1743	My father's goods are all distrain'd and sold,
1744	And these and all are all amiss employ'd.
1745	What would you have me do? I am a subject,
1746	And I challenge law: attorneys are denied me;
1747	And therefore, personally I lay my claim
1748	To my inheritance of free descent.
1749	
1750	NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath been too much abused.
1751	
1752	LORD ROSS	It stands your grace upon to do him right.
1753	
1754	LORD WILLOUGHBY	Base men by his endowments are made great.
1755	
1756	DUKE OF YORK	My lords of England, let me tell you this:
1757	I have had feeling of my cousin's wrongs
1758	And laboured all I could to do him right;
1759	But in this kind to come, in braving arms,
1760	Be his own carver and cut out his way,
1761	To find out right with wrong, it may not be;
1762	And you that do abet him in this kind
1763	Cherish rebellion and are rebels all.
1764	
1765	NORTHUMBERLAND	The noble duke hath sworn his coming is
1766	But for his own; and for the right of that
1767	We all have strongly sworn to give him aid;
1768	And let him ne'er see joy that breaks that oath!
1769	
1770	DUKE OF YORK	Well, well, I see the issue of these arms:
1771	I cannot mend it, I must needs confess,
1772	Because my power is weak and all ill left:
1773	But if I could, by Him that gave me life,
1774	I would attach you all and make you stoop
1775	Unto the sovereign mercy of the king;
1776	But since I cannot, be it known to you
1777	I do remain as neuter. So, fare you well;
1778	Unless you please to enter in the castle
1779	And there repose you for this night.
1780	
1781	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	An offer, uncle, that we will accept:
1782	But we must win your grace to go with us
1783	To Bristol castle, which they say is held
1784	By Bushy, Bagot and their complices,
1785	The caterpillars of the commonwealth,
1786	Which I have sworn to weed and pluck away.
1787	
1788	DUKE OF YORK	It may be I will go with you: but yet I'll pause;
1789	For I am loath to break our country's laws.
1790	Nor friends nor foes, to me welcome you are:
1791	Things past redress are now with me past care.

1805	SCENE IV	A camp in Wales.
1806	
1807	
1808	[Enter EARL OF SALISBURY and a Welsh Captain]
1809	
1810	Captain	My lord of Salisbury, we have stay'd ten days,
1811	And hardly kept our countrymen together,
1812	And yet we hear no tidings from the king;
1813	Therefore we will disperse ourselves: farewell.
1814	
1815	EARL OF SALISBURY	Stay yet another day, thou trusty Welshman:
1816	The king reposeth all his confidence in thee.
1817	
1818	Captain	'Tis thought the king is dead; we will not stay.
1819	The bay-trees in our country are all wither'd
1820	And meteors fright the fixed stars of heaven;
1821	The pale-faced moon looks bloody on the earth
1822	And lean-look'd prophets whisper fearful change;
1823	Rich men look sad and ruffians dance and leap,
1824	The one in fear to lose what they enjoy,
1825	The other to enjoy by rage and war:
1826	These signs forerun the death or fall of kings.
1827	Farewell: our countrymen are gone and fled,
1828	As well assured Richard their king is dead.
1829	
1830	[Exit]
1831	
1832	EARL OF SALISBURY	Ah, Richard, with the eyes of heavy mind
1833	I see thy glory like a shooting star
1834	Fall to the base earth from the firmament.
1835	Thy sun sets weeping in the lowly west,
1836	Witnessing storms to come, woe and unrest:
1837	Thy friends are fled to wait upon thy foes,
1838	And crossly to thy good all fortune goes.

1852	SCENE I	Bristol. Before the castle.
1853	
1854	
1855	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK,
1856	NORTHUMBERLAND, LORD ROSS, HENRY PERCY, LORD
1857	WILLOUGHBY, with BUSHY and GREEN, prisoners]
1858	
1859	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Bring forth these men.
1860	Bushy and Green, I will not vex your souls--
1861	Since presently your souls must part your bodies--
1862	With too much urging your pernicious lives,
1863	For 'twere no charity; yet, to wash your blood
1864	From off my hands, here in the view of men
1865	I will unfold some causes of your deaths.
1866	You have misled a prince, a royal king,
1867	A happy gentleman in blood and lineaments,
1868	By you unhappied and disfigured clean:
1869	You have in manner with your sinful hours
1870	Made a divorce betwixt his queen and him,
1871	Broke the possession of a royal bed
1872	And stain'd the beauty of a fair queen's cheeks
1873	With tears drawn from her eyes by your foul wrongs.
1874	Myself, a prince by fortune of my birth,
1875	Near to the king in blood, and near in love
1876	Till you did make him misinterpret me,
1877	Have stoop'd my neck under your injuries,
1878	And sigh'd my English breath in foreign clouds,
1879	Eating the bitter bread of banishment;
1880	Whilst you have fed upon my signories,
1881	Dispark'd my parks and fell'd my forest woods,
1882	From my own windows torn my household coat,
1883	Razed out my imprese, leaving me no sign,
1884	Save men's opinions and my living blood,
1885	To show the world I am a gentleman.
1886	This and much more, much more than twice all this,
1887	Condemns you to the death. See them deliver'd over
1888	To execution and the hand of death.
1889	
1890	BUSHY	More welcome is the stroke of death to me
1891	Than Bolingbroke to England. Lords, farewell.
1892	
1893	GREEN	My comfort is that heaven will take our souls
1894	And plague injustice with the pains of hell.
1895	
1896	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My Lord Northumberland, see them dispatch'd.
1897	
1898	[Exeunt NORTHUMBERLAND and others, with the
1899	prisoners]
1900	
1901	Uncle, you say the queen is at your house;
1902	For God's sake, fairly let her be entreated:
1903	Tell her I send to her my kind commends;
1904	Take special care my greetings be deliver'd.
1905	
1906	DUKE OF YORK	A gentleman of mine I have dispatch'd
1907	With letters of your love to her at large.
1908	
1909	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Thank, gentle uncle. Come, lords, away.
1910	To fight with Glendower and his complices:
1911	Awhile to work, and after holiday.

1925	SCENE II	The coast of Wales. A castle in view.
1926	
1927	
1928	[Drums; flourish and colours. Enter KING RICHARD
1929	II, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, and Soldiers]
1930	
1931	KING RICHARD II	Barkloughly castle call they this at hand?
1932	
1933	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Yea, my lord. How brooks your grace the air,
1934	After your late tossing on the breaking seas?
1935	
1936	KING RICHARD II	Needs must I like it well: I weep for joy
1937	To stand upon my kingdom once again.
1938	Dear earth, I do salute thee with my hand,
1939	Though rebels wound thee with their horses' hoofs:
1940	As a long-parted mother with her child
1941	Plays fondly with her tears and smiles in meeting,
1942	So, weeping, smiling, greet I thee, my earth,
1943	And do thee favours with my royal hands.
1944	Feed not thy sovereign's foe, my gentle earth,
1945	Nor with thy sweets comfort his ravenous sense;
1946	But let thy spiders, that suck up thy venom,
1947	And heavy-gaited toads lie in their way,
1948	Doing annoyance to the treacherous feet
1949	Which with usurping steps do trample thee:
1950	Yield stinging nettles to mine enemies;
1951	And when they from thy bosom pluck a flower,
1952	Guard it, I pray thee, with a lurking adder
1953	Whose double tongue may with a mortal touch
1954	Throw death upon thy sovereign's enemies.
1955	Mock not my senseless conjuration, lords:
1956	This earth shall have a feeling and these stones
1957	Prove armed soldiers, ere her native king
1958	Shall falter under foul rebellion's arms.
1959	
1960	BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Fear not, my lord: that Power that made you king
1961	Hath power to keep you king in spite of all.
1962	The means that heaven yields must be embraced,
1963	And not neglected; else, if heaven would,
1964	And we will not, heaven's offer we refuse,
1965	The proffer'd means of succor and redress.
1966	
1967	DUKE OF AUMERLE	He means, my lord, that we are too remiss;
1968	Whilst Bolingbroke, through our security,
1969	Grows strong and great in substance and in power.
1970	
1971	KING RICHARD II	Discomfortable cousin! know'st thou not
1972	That when the searching eye of heaven is hid,
1973	Behind the globe, that lights the lower world,
1974	Then thieves and robbers range abroad unseen
1975	In murders and in outrage, boldly here;
1976	But when from under this terrestrial ball
1977	He fires the proud tops of the eastern pines
1978	And darts his light through every guilty hole,
1979	Then murders, treasons and detested sins,
1980	The cloak of night being pluck'd from off their backs,
1981	Stand bare and naked, trembling at themselves?
1982	So when this thief, this traitor, Bolingbroke,
1983	Who all this while hath revell'd in the night
1984	Whilst we were wandering with the antipodes,
1985	Shall see us rising in our throne, the east,
1986	His treasons will sit blushing in his face,
1987	Not able to endure the sight of day,
1988	But self-affrighted tremble at his sin.
1989	Not all the water in the rough rude sea
1990	Can wash the balm off from an anointed king;
1991	The breath of worldly men cannot depose
1992	The deputy elected by the Lord:
1993	For every man that Bolingbroke hath press'd
1994	To lift shrewd steel against our golden crown,
1995	God for his Richard hath in heavenly pay
1996	A glorious angel: then, if angels fight,
1997	Weak men must fall, for heaven still guards the right.
1998	
1999	[Enter EARL OF SALISBURY]
2000	
2001	Welcome, my lord	how far off lies your power?
2002	
2003	EARL OF SALISBURY	Nor near nor farther off, my gracious lord,
2004	Than this weak arm: discomfort guides my tongue
2005	And bids me speak of nothing but despair.
2006	One day too late, I fear me, noble lord,
2007	Hath clouded all thy happy days on earth:
2008	O, call back yesterday, bid time return,
2009	And thou shalt have twelve thousand fighting men!
2010	To-day, to-day, unhappy day, too late,
2011	O'erthrows thy joys, friends, fortune and thy state:
2012	For all the Welshmen, hearing thou wert dead.
2013	Are gone to Bolingbroke, dispersed and fled.
2014	
2015	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; why looks your grace so pale?
2016	
2017	KING RICHARD II	But now the blood of twenty thousand men
2018	Did triumph in my face, and they are fled;
2019	And, till so much blood thither come again,
2020	Have I not reason to look pale and dead?
2021	All souls that will be safe fly from my side,
2022	For time hath set a blot upon my pride.
2023	
2024	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Comfort, my liege; remember who you are.
2025	
2026	KING RICHARD II	I had forgot myself; am I not king?
2027	Awake, thou coward majesty! thou sleepest.
2028	Is not the king's name twenty thousand names?
2029	Arm, arm, my name! a puny subject strikes
2030	At thy great glory. Look not to the ground,
2031	Ye favourites of a king: are we not high?
2032	High be our thoughts: I know my uncle York
2033	Hath power enough to serve our turn. But who comes here?
2034	
2035	[Enter SIR STEPHEN SCROOP]
2036	
2037	SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	More health and happiness betide my liege
2038	Than can my care-tuned tongue deliver him!
2039	
2040	KING RICHARD II	Mine ear is open and my heart prepared;
2041	The worst is worldly loss thou canst unfold.
2042	Say, is my kingdom lost? why, 'twas my care
2043	And what loss is it to be rid of care?
2044	Strives Bolingbroke to be as great as we?
2045	Greater he shall not be; if he serve God,
2046	We'll serve Him too and be his fellow so:
2047	Revolt our subjects? that we cannot mend;
2048	They break their faith to God as well as us:
2049	Cry woe, destruction, ruin and decay:
2050	The worst is death, and death will have his day.
2051	
2052	SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Glad am I that your highness is so arm'd
2053	To bear the tidings of calamity.
2054	Like an unseasonable stormy day,
2055	Which makes the silver rivers drown their shores,
2056	As if the world were all dissolved to tears,
2057	So high above his limits swells the rage
2058	Of Bolingbroke, covering your fearful land
2059	With hard bright steel and hearts harder than steel.
2060	White-beards have arm'd their thin and hairless scalps
2061	Against thy majesty; boys, with women's voices,
2062	Strive to speak big and clap their female joints
2063	In stiff unwieldy arms against thy crown:
2064	The very beadsmen learn to bend their bows
2065	Of double-fatal yew against thy state;
2066	Yea, distaff-women manage rusty bills
2067	Against thy seat: both young and old rebel,
2068	And all goes worse than I have power to tell.
2069	
2070	KING RICHARD II	Too well, too well thou tell'st a tale so ill.
2071	Where is the Earl of Wiltshire? where is Bagot?
2072	What is become of Bushy? where is Green?
2073	That they have let the dangerous enemy
2074	Measure our confines with such peaceful steps?
2075	If we prevail, their heads shall pay for it:
2076	I warrant they have made peace with Bolingbroke.
2077	
2078	SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Peace have they made with him indeed, my lord.
2079	
2080	KING RICHARD II	O villains, vipers, damn'd without redemption!
2081	Dogs, easily won to fawn on any man!
2082	Snakes, in my heart-blood warm'd, that sting my heart!
2083	Three Judases, each one thrice worse than Judas!
2084	Would they make peace? terrible hell make war
2085	Upon their spotted souls for this offence!
2086	
2087	SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Sweet love, I see, changing his property,
2088	Turns to the sourest and most deadly hate:
2089	Again uncurse their souls; their peace is made
2090	With heads, and not with hands; those whom you curse
2091	Have felt the worst of death's destroying wound
2092	And lie full low, graved in the hollow ground.
2093	
2094	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Is Bushy, Green, and the Earl of Wiltshire dead?
2095	
2096	SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Ay, all of them at Bristol lost their heads.
2097	
2098	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Where is the duke my father with his power?
2099	
2100	KING RICHARD II	No matter where; of comfort no man speak:
2101	Let's talk of graves, of worms, and epitaphs;
2102	Make dust our paper and with rainy eyes
2103	Write sorrow on the bosom of the earth,
2104	Let's choose executors and talk of wills:
2105	And yet not so, for what can we bequeath
2106	Save our deposed bodies to the ground?
2107	Our lands, our lives and all are Bolingbroke's,
2108	And nothing can we call our own but death
2109	And that small model of the barren earth
2110	Which serves as paste and cover to our bones.
2111	For God's sake, let us sit upon the ground
2112	And tell sad stories of the death of kings;
2113	How some have been deposed; some slain in war,
2114	Some haunted by the ghosts they have deposed;
2115	Some poison'd by their wives: some sleeping kill'd;
2116	All murder'd: for within the hollow crown
2117	That rounds the mortal temples of a king
2118	Keeps Death his court and there the antic sits,
2119	Scoffing his state and grinning at his pomp,
2120	Allowing him a breath, a little scene,
2121	To monarchize, be fear'd and kill with looks,
2122	Infusing him with self and vain conceit,
2123	As if this flesh which walls about our life,
2124	Were brass impregnable, and humour'd thus
2125	Comes at the last and with a little pin
2126	Bores through his castle wall, and farewell king!
2127	Cover your heads and mock not flesh and blood
2128	With solemn reverence: throw away respect,
2129	Tradition, form and ceremonious duty,
2130	For you have but mistook me all this while:
2131	I live with bread like you, feel want,
2132	Taste grief, need friends: subjected thus,
2133	How can you say to me, I am a king?
2134	
2135	BISHOP OF CARLISLE	My lord, wise men ne'er sit and wail their woes,
2136	But presently prevent the ways to wail.
2137	To fear the foe, since fear oppresseth strength,
2138	Gives in your weakness strength unto your foe,
2139	And so your follies fight against yourself.
2140	Fear and be slain; no worse can come to fight:
2141	And fight and die is death destroying death;
2142	Where fearing dying pays death servile breath.
2143	
2144	DUKE OF AUMERLE	My father hath a power; inquire of him
2145	And learn to make a body of a limb.
2146	
2147	KING RICHARD II	Thou chidest me well: proud Bolingbroke, I come
2148	To change blows with thee for our day of doom.
2149	This ague fit of fear is over-blown;
2150	An easy task it is to win our own.
2151	Say, Scroop, where lies our uncle with his power?
2152	Speak sweetly, man, although thy looks be sour.
2153	
2154	SIR STEPHEN SCROOP	Men judge by the complexion of the sky
2155	The state and inclination of the day:
2156	So may you by my dull and heavy eye,
2157	My tongue hath but a heavier tale to say.
2158	I play the torturer, by small and small
2159	To lengthen out the worst that must be spoken:
2160	Your uncle York is join'd with Bolingbroke,
2161	And all your northern castles yielded up,
2162	And all your southern gentlemen in arms
2163	Upon his party.
2164	
2165	KING RICHARD II	                  Thou hast said enough.
2166	Beshrew thee, cousin, which didst lead me forth
2167	
2168	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]
2169	
2170	Of that sweet way I was in to despair!
2171	What say you now? what comfort have we now?
2172	By heaven, I'll hate him everlastingly
2173	That bids me be of comfort any more.
2174	Go to Flint castle: there I'll pine away;
2175	A king, woe's slave, shall kingly woe obey.
2176	That power I have, discharge; and let them go
2177	To ear the land that hath some hope to grow,
2178	For I have none: let no man speak again
2179	To alter this, for counsel is but vain.
2180	
2181	DUKE OF AUMERLE	My liege, one word.
2182	
2183	KING RICHARD II	He does me double wrong
2184	That wounds me with the flatteries of his tongue.
2185	Discharge my followers: let them hence away,
2186	From Richard's night to Bolingbroke's fair day.
2187	
2188	[Exeunt]

2195	
2196	ACT III
2197	
2198	
2199	
2200	SCENE III	Wales. Before Flint castle.
2201	
2202	
2203	[Enter, with drum and colours, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
2204	DUKE OF YORK, NORTHUMBERLAND, Attendants, and forces]
2205	
2206	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	So that by this intelligence we learn
2207	The Welshmen are dispersed, and Salisbury
2208	Is gone to meet the king, who lately landed
2209	With some few private friends upon this coast.
2210	
2211	NORTHUMBERLAND	The news is very fair and good, my lord:
2212	Richard not far from hence hath hid his head.
2213	
2214	DUKE OF YORK	It would beseem the Lord Northumberland
2215	To say 'King Richard:' alack the heavy day
2216	When such a sacred king should hide his head.
2217	
2218	NORTHUMBERLAND	Your grace mistakes; only to be brief
2219	Left I his title out.
2220	
2221	DUKE OF YORK	The time hath been,
2222	Would you have been so brief with him, he would
2223	Have been so brief with you, to shorten you,
2224	For taking so the head, your whole head's length.
2225	
2226	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Mistake not, uncle, further than you should.
2227	
2228	DUKE OF YORK	Take not, good cousin, further than you should.
2229	Lest you mistake the heavens are o'er our heads.
2230	
2231	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I know it, uncle, and oppose not myself
2232	Against their will. But who comes here?
2233	
2234	[Enter HENRY PERCY]
2235	
2236	Welcome, Harry: what, will not this castle yield?
2237	
2238	HENRY PERCY	The castle royally is mann'd, my lord,
2239	Against thy entrance.
2240	
2241	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Royally!
2242	Why, it contains no king?
2243	
2244	HENRY PERCY	Yes, my good lord,
2245	It doth contain a king; King Richard lies
2246	Within the limits of yon lime and stone:
2247	And with him are the Lord Aumerle, Lord Salisbury,
2248	Sir Stephen Scroop, besides a clergyman
2249	Of holy reverence; who, I cannot learn.
2250	
2251	NORTHUMBERLAND	O, belike it is the Bishop of Carlisle.
2252	
2253	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Noble lords,
2254	Go to the rude ribs of that ancient castle;
2255	Through brazen trumpet send the breath of parley
2256	Into his ruin'd ears, and thus deliver:
2257	Henry Bolingbroke
2258	On both his knees doth kiss King Richard's hand
2259	And sends allegiance and true faith of heart
2260	To his most royal person, hither come
2261	Even at his feet to lay my arms and power,
2262	Provided that my banishment repeal'd
2263	And lands restored again be freely granted:
2264	If not, I'll use the advantage of my power
2265	And lay the summer's dust with showers of blood
2266	Rain'd from the wounds of slaughter'd Englishmen:
2267	The which, how far off from the mind of Bolingbroke
2268	It is, such crimson tempest should bedrench
2269	The fresh green lap of fair King Richard's land,
2270	My stooping duty tenderly shall show.
2271	Go, signify as much, while here we march
2272	Upon the grassy carpet of this plain.
2273	Let's march without the noise of threatening drum,
2274	That from this castle's tatter'd battlements
2275	Our fair appointments may be well perused.
2276	Methinks King Richard and myself should meet
2277	With no less terror than the elements
2278	Of fire and water, when their thundering shock
2279	At meeting tears the cloudy cheeks of heaven.
2280	Be he the fire, I'll be the yielding water:
2281	The rage be his, whilst on the earth I rain
2282	My waters; on the earth, and not on him.
2283	March on, and mark King Richard how he looks.
2284	
2285	[Parle without, and answer within. Then a flourish.
2286	Enter on the walls, KING RICHARD II, the BISHOP OF
2287	CARLISLE, DUKE OF AUMERLE, SIR STEPHEN SCROOP, and
2288	EARL OF SALISBURY]
2289	
2290	See, see, King Richard doth himself appear,
2291	As doth the blushing discontented sun
2292	From out the fiery portal of the east,
2293	When he perceives the envious clouds are bent
2294	To dim his glory and to stain the track
2295	Of his bright passage to the occident.
2296	
2297	DUKE OF YORK	Yet looks he like a king: behold, his eye,
2298	As bright as is the eagle's, lightens forth
2299	Controlling majesty: alack, alack, for woe,
2300	That any harm should stain so fair a show!
2301	
2302	KING RICHARD II	We are amazed; and thus long have we stood
2303	To watch the fearful bending of thy knee,
2304	
2305	[To NORTHUMBERLAND]
2306	
2307	Because we thought ourself thy lawful king:
2308	And if we be, how dare thy joints forget
2309	To pay their awful duty to our presence?
2310	If we be not, show us the hand of God
2311	That hath dismissed us from our stewardship;
2312	For well we know, no hand of blood and bone
2313	Can gripe the sacred handle of our sceptre,
2314	Unless he do profane, steal, or usurp.
2315	And though you think that all, as you have done,
2316	Have torn their souls by turning them from us,
2317	And we are barren and bereft of friends;
2318	Yet know, my master, God omnipotent,
2319	Is mustering in his clouds on our behalf
2320	Armies of pestilence; and they shall strike
2321	Your children yet unborn and unbegot,
2322	That lift your vassal hands against my head
2323	And threat the glory of my precious crown.
2324	Tell Bolingbroke--for yond methinks he stands--
2325	That every stride he makes upon my land
2326	Is dangerous treason: he is come to open
2327	The purple testament of bleeding war;
2328	But ere the crown he looks for live in peace,
2329	Ten thousand bloody crowns of mothers' sons
2330	Shall ill become the flower of England's face,
2331	Change the complexion of her maid-pale peace
2332	To scarlet indignation and bedew
2333	Her pastures' grass with faithful English blood.
2334	
2335	NORTHUMBERLAND	The king of heaven forbid our lord the king
2336	Should so with civil and uncivil arms
2337	Be rush'd upon! Thy thrice noble cousin
2338	Harry Bolingbroke doth humbly kiss thy hand;
2339	And by the honourable tomb he swears,
2340	That stands upon your royal grandsire's bones,
2341	And by the royalties of both your bloods,
2342	Currents that spring from one most gracious head,
2343	And by the buried hand of warlike Gaunt,
2344	And by the worth and honour of himself,
2345	Comprising all that may be sworn or said,
2346	His coming hither hath no further scope
2347	Than for his lineal royalties and to beg
2348	Enfranchisement immediate on his knees:
2349	Which on thy royal party granted once,
2350	His glittering arms he will commend to rust,
2351	His barbed steeds to stables, and his heart
2352	To faithful service of your majesty.
2353	This swears he, as he is a prince, is just;
2354	And, as I am a gentleman, I credit him.
2355	
2356	KING RICHARD II	Northumberland, say thus the king returns:
2357	His noble cousin is right welcome hither;
2358	And all the number of his fair demands
2359	Shall be accomplish'd without contradiction:
2360	With all the gracious utterance thou hast
2361	Speak to his gentle hearing kind commends.
2362	We do debase ourselves, cousin, do we not,
2363	
2364	[To DUKE OF AUMERLE]
2365	
2366	To look so poorly and to speak so fair?
2367	Shall we call back Northumberland, and send
2368	Defiance to the traitor, and so die?
2369	
2370	DUKE OF AUMERLE	No, good my lord; let's fight with gentle words
2371	Till time lend friends and friends their helpful swords.
2372	
2373	KING RICHARD II	O God, O God! that e'er this tongue of mine,
2374	That laid the sentence of dread banishment
2375	On yon proud man, should take it off again
2376	With words of sooth! O that I were as great
2377	As is my grief, or lesser than my name!
2378	Or that I could forget what I have been,
2379	Or not remember what I must be now!
2380	Swell'st thou, proud heart? I'll give thee scope to beat,
2381	Since foes have scope to beat both thee and me.
2382	
2383	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Northumberland comes back from Bolingbroke.
2384	
2385	KING RICHARD II	What must the king do now? must he submit?
2386	The king shall do it: must he be deposed?
2387	The king shall be contented: must he lose
2388	The name of king? o' God's name, let it go:
2389	I'll give my jewels for a set of beads,
2390	My gorgeous palace for a hermitage,
2391	My gay apparel for an almsman's gown,
2392	My figured goblets for a dish of wood,
2393	My sceptre for a palmer's walking staff,
2394	My subjects for a pair of carved saints
2395	And my large kingdom for a little grave,
2396	A little little grave, an obscure grave;
2397	Or I'll be buried in the king's highway,
2398	Some way of common trade, where subjects' feet
2399	May hourly trample on their sovereign's head;
2400	For on my heart they tread now whilst I live;
2401	And buried once, why not upon my head?
2402	Aumerle, thou weep'st, my tender-hearted cousin!
2403	We'll make foul weather with despised tears;
2404	Our sighs and they shall lodge the summer corn,
2405	And make a dearth in this revolting land.
2406	Or shall we play the wantons with our woes,
2407	And make some pretty match with shedding tears?
2408	As thus, to drop them still upon one place,
2409	Till they have fretted us a pair of graves
2410	Within the earth; and, therein laid,--there lies
2411	Two kinsmen digg'd their graves with weeping eyes.
2412	Would not this ill do well? Well, well, I see
2413	I talk but idly, and you laugh at me.
2414	Most mighty prince, my Lord Northumberland,
2415	What says King Bolingbroke? will his majesty
2416	Give Richard leave to live till Richard die?
2417	You make a leg, and Bolingbroke says ay.
2418	
2419	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, in the base court he doth attend
2420	To speak with you; may it please you to come down.
2421	
2422	KING RICHARD II	Down, down I come; like glistering Phaethon,
2423	Wanting the manage of unruly jades.
2424	In the base court? Base court, where kings grow base,
2425	To come at traitors' calls and do them grace.
2426	In the base court? Come down? Down, court!
2427	down, king!
2428	For night-owls shriek where mounting larks
2429	should sing.
2430	
2431	[Exeunt from above]
2432	
2433	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What says his majesty?
2434	
2435	NORTHUMBERLAND	Sorrow and grief of heart
2436	Makes him speak fondly, like a frantic man
2437	Yet he is come.
2438	
2439	[Enter KING RICHARD and his attendants below]
2440	
2441	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Stand all apart,
2442	And show fair duty to his majesty.
2443	
2444	[He kneels down]
2445	
2446	My gracious lord,--
2447	
2448	KING RICHARD II	Fair cousin, you debase your princely knee
2449	To make the base earth proud with kissing it:
2450	Me rather had my heart might feel your love
2451	Than my unpleased eye see your courtesy.
2452	Up, cousin, up; your heart is up, I know,
2453	Thus high at least, although your knee be low.
2454	
2455	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	My gracious lord, I come but for mine own.
2456	
2457	KING RICHARD II	Your own is yours, and I am yours, and all.
2458	
2459	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	So far be mine, my most redoubted lord,
2460	As my true service shall deserve your love.
2461	
2462	KING RICHARD II	Well you deserve: they well deserve to have,
2463	That know the strong'st and surest way to get.
2464	Uncle, give me your hands: nay, dry your eyes;
2465	Tears show their love, but want their remedies.
2466	Cousin, I am too young to be your father,
2467	Though you are old enough to be my heir.
2468	What you will have, I'll give, and willing too;
2469	For do we must what force will have us do.
2470	Set on towards London, cousin, is it so?
2471	
2472	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Yea, my good lord.
2473	
2474	KING RICHARD II	Then I must not say no.
2475	
2476	[Flourish. Exeunt]

2483	
2484	ACT III
2485	
2486	
2487	
2488	SCENE IV	LANGLEY. The DUKE OF YORK's garden.
2489	
2490	
2491	[Enter the QUEEN and two Ladies]
2492	
2493	QUEEN	What sport shall we devise here in this garden,
2494	To drive away the heavy thought of care?
2495	
2496	Lady	Madam, we'll play at bowls.
2497	
2498	QUEEN	'Twill make me think the world is full of rubs,
2499	And that my fortune rubs against the bias.
2500	
2501	Lady	Madam, we'll dance.
2502	
2503	QUEEN	My legs can keep no measure in delight,
2504	When my poor heart no measure keeps in grief:
2505	Therefore, no dancing, girl; some other sport.
2506	
2507	Lady	Madam, we'll tell tales.
2508	
2509	QUEEN	Of sorrow or of joy?
2510	
2511	Lady	Of either, madam.
2512	
2513	QUEEN	Of neither, girl:
2514	For of joy, being altogether wanting,
2515	It doth remember me the more of sorrow;
2516	Or if of grief, being altogether had,
2517	It adds more sorrow to my want of joy:
2518	For what I have I need not to repeat;
2519	And what I want it boots not to complain.
2520	
2521	Lady	Madam, I'll sing.
2522	
2523	QUEEN	'Tis well that thou hast cause
2524	But thou shouldst please me better, wouldst thou weep.
2525	
2526	Lady	I could weep, madam, would it do you good.
2527	
2528	QUEEN	And I could sing, would weeping do me good,
2529	And never borrow any tear of thee.
2530	
2531	[Enter a Gardener, and two Servants]
2532	
2533	But stay, here come the gardeners:
2534	Let's step into the shadow of these trees.
2535	My wretchedness unto a row of pins,
2536	They'll talk of state; for every one doth so
2537	Against a change; woe is forerun with woe.
2538	
2539	[QUEEN and Ladies retire]
2540	
2541	Gardener	Go, bind thou up yon dangling apricocks,
2542	Which, like unruly children, make their sire
2543	Stoop with oppression of their prodigal weight:
2544	Give some supportance to the bending twigs.
2545	Go thou, and like an executioner,
2546	Cut off the heads of too fast growing sprays,
2547	That look too lofty in our commonwealth:
2548	All must be even in our government.
2549	You thus employ'd, I will go root away
2550	The noisome weeds, which without profit suck
2551	The soil's fertility from wholesome flowers.
2552	
2553	Servant	Why should we in the compass of a pale
2554	Keep law and form and due proportion,
2555	Showing, as in a model, our firm estate,
2556	When our sea-walled garden, the whole land,
2557	Is full of weeds, her fairest flowers choked up,
2558	Her fruit-trees all upturned, her hedges ruin'd,
2559	Her knots disorder'd and her wholesome herbs
2560	Swarming with caterpillars?
2561	
2562	Gardener	Hold thy peace:
2563	He that hath suffer'd this disorder'd spring
2564	Hath now himself met with the fall of leaf:
2565	The weeds which his broad-spreading leaves did shelter,
2566	That seem'd in eating him to hold him up,
2567	Are pluck'd up root and all by Bolingbroke,
2568	I mean the Earl of Wiltshire, Bushy, Green.
2569	
2570	Servant	What, are they dead?
2571	
2572	Gardener	They are; and Bolingbroke
2573	Hath seized the wasteful king. O, what pity is it
2574	That he had not so trimm'd and dress'd his land
2575	As we this garden! We at time of year
2576	Do wound the bark, the skin of our fruit-trees,
2577	Lest, being over-proud in sap and blood,
2578	With too much riches it confound itself:
2579	Had he done so to great and growing men,
2580	They might have lived to bear and he to taste
2581	Their fruits of duty: superfluous branches
2582	We lop away, that bearing boughs may live:
2583	Had he done so, himself had borne the crown,
2584	Which waste of idle hours hath quite thrown down.
2585	
2586	Servant	What, think you then the king shall be deposed?
2587	
2588	Gardener	Depress'd he is already, and deposed
2589	'Tis doubt he will be: letters came last night
2590	To a dear friend of the good Duke of York's,
2591	That tell black tidings.
2592	
2593	QUEEN	O, I am press'd to death through want of speaking!
2594	
2595	[Coming forward]
2596	
2597	Thou, old Adam's likeness, set to dress this garden,
2598	How dares thy harsh rude tongue sound this unpleasing news?
2599	What Eve, what serpent, hath suggested thee
2600	To make a second fall of cursed man?
2601	Why dost thou say King Richard is deposed?
2602	Darest thou, thou little better thing than earth,
2603	Divine his downfall? Say, where, when, and how,
2604	Camest thou by this ill tidings? speak, thou wretch.
2605	
2606	Gardener	Pardon me, madam: little joy have I
2607	To breathe this news; yet what I say is true.
2608	King Richard, he is in the mighty hold
2609	Of Bolingbroke: their fortunes both are weigh'd:
2610	In your lord's scale is nothing but himself,
2611	And some few vanities that make him light;
2612	But in the balance of great Bolingbroke,
2613	Besides himself, are all the English peers,
2614	And with that odds he weighs King Richard down.
2615	Post you to London, and you will find it so;
2616	I speak no more than every one doth know.
2617	
2618	QUEEN	Nimble mischance, that art so light of foot,
2619	Doth not thy embassage belong to me,
2620	And am I last that knows it? O, thou think'st
2621	To serve me last, that I may longest keep
2622	Thy sorrow in my breast. Come, ladies, go,
2623	To meet at London London's king in woe.
2624	What, was I born to this, that my sad look
2625	Should grace the triumph of great Bolingbroke?
2626	Gardener, for telling me these news of woe,
2627	Pray God the plants thou graft'st may never grow.
2628	
2629	[Exeunt QUEEN and Ladies]
2630	
2631	GARDENER	Poor queen! so that thy state might be no worse,
2632	I would my skill were subject to thy curse.
2633	Here did she fall a tear; here in this place
2634	I'll set a bank of rue, sour herb of grace:
2635	Rue, even for ruth, here shortly shall be seen,
2636	In the remembrance of a weeping queen.
2637	
2638	[Exeunt]

2646	ACT IV
2647	
2648	
2649	
2650	SCENE I	Westminster Hall.
2651	
2652	
2653	[Enter, as to the Parliament, HENRY BOLINGBROKE,
2654	DUKE OF AUMERLE, NORTHUMBERLAND, HENRY PERCY, LORD
2655	FITZWATER, DUKE OF SURREY, the BISHOP OF CARLISLE,
2656	the Abbot Of Westminster, and another Lord, Herald,
2657	Officers, and BAGOT]
2658	
2659	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Call forth Bagot.
2660	Now, Bagot, freely speak thy mind;
2661	What thou dost know of noble Gloucester's death,
2662	Who wrought it with the king, and who perform'd
2663	The bloody office of his timeless end.
2664	
2665	BAGOT	Then set before my face the Lord Aumerle.
2666	
2667	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Cousin, stand forth, and look upon that man.
2668	
2669	BAGOT	My Lord Aumerle, I know your daring tongue
2670	Scorns to unsay what once it hath deliver'd.
2671	In that dead time when Gloucester's death was plotted,
2672	I heard you say, 'Is not my arm of length,
2673	That reacheth from the restful English court
2674	As far as Calais, to mine uncle's head?'
2675	Amongst much other talk, that very time,
2676	I heard you say that you had rather refuse
2677	The offer of an hundred thousand crowns
2678	Than Bolingbroke's return to England;
2679	Adding withal how blest this land would be
2680	In this your cousin's death.
2681	
2682	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Princes and noble lords,
2683	What answer shall I make to this base man?
2684	Shall I so much dishonour my fair stars,
2685	On equal terms to give him chastisement?
2686	Either I must, or have mine honour soil'd
2687	With the attainder of his slanderous lips.
2688	There is my gage, the manual seal of death,
2689	That marks thee out for hell: I say, thou liest,
2690	And will maintain what thou hast said is false
2691	In thy heart-blood, though being all too base
2692	To stain the temper of my knightly sword.
2693	
2694	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Bagot, forbear; thou shalt not take it up.
2695	
2696	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Excepting one, I would he were the best
2697	In all this presence that hath moved me so.
2698	
2699	LORD FITZWATER	If that thy valour stand on sympathy,
2700	There is my gage, Aumerle, in gage to thine:
2701	By that fair sun which shows me where thou stand'st,
2702	I heard thee say, and vauntingly thou spakest it
2703	That thou wert cause of noble Gloucester's death.
2704	If thou deny'st it twenty times, thou liest;
2705	And I will turn thy falsehood to thy heart,
2706	Where it was forged, with my rapier's point.
2707	
2708	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Thou darest not, coward, live to see that day.
2709	
2710	LORD FITZWATER	Now by my soul, I would it were this hour.
2711	
2712	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Fitzwater, thou art damn'd to hell for this.
2713	
2714	HENRY PERCY	Aumerle, thou liest; his honour is as true
2715	In this appeal as thou art all unjust;
2716	And that thou art so, there I throw my gage,
2717	To prove it on thee to the extremest point
2718	Of mortal breathing: seize it, if thou darest.
2719	
2720	DUKE OF AUMERLE	An if I do not, may my hands rot off
2721	And never brandish more revengeful steel
2722	Over the glittering helmet of my foe!
2723	
2724	Lord	I task the earth to the like, forsworn Aumerle;
2725	And spur thee on with full as many lies
2726	As may be holloa'd in thy treacherous ear
2727	From sun to sun: there is my honour's pawn;
2728	Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
2729	
2730	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Who sets me else? by heaven, I'll throw at all:
2731	I have a thousand spirits in one breast,
2732	To answer twenty thousand such as you.
2733	
2734	DUKE OF SURREY	My Lord Fitzwater, I do remember well
2735	The very time Aumerle and you did talk.
2736	
2737	LORD FITZWATER	'Tis very true: you were in presence then;
2738	And you can witness with me this is true.
2739	
2740	DUKE OF SURREY	As false, by heaven, as heaven itself is true.
2741	
2742	LORD FITZWATER	Surrey, thou liest.
2743	
2744	DUKE OF SURREY	Dishonourable boy!
2745	That lie shall lie so heavy on my sword,
2746	That it shall render vengeance and revenge
2747	Till thou the lie-giver and that lie do lie
2748	In earth as quiet as thy father's skull:
2749	In proof whereof, there is my honour's pawn;
2750	Engage it to the trial, if thou darest.
2751	
2752	LORD FITZWATER	How fondly dost thou spur a forward horse!
2753	If I dare eat, or drink, or breathe, or live,
2754	I dare meet Surrey in a wilderness,
2755	And spit upon him, whilst I say he lies,
2756	And lies, and lies: there is my bond of faith,
2757	To tie thee to my strong correction.
2758	As I intend to thrive in this new world,
2759	Aumerle is guilty of my true appeal:
2760	Besides, I heard the banish'd Norfolk say
2761	That thou, Aumerle, didst send two of thy men
2762	To execute the noble duke at Calais.
2763	
2764	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Some honest Christian trust me with a gage
2765	That Norfolk lies: here do I throw down this,
2766	If he may be repeal'd, to try his honour.
2767	
2768	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	These differences shall all rest under gage
2769	Till Norfolk be repeal'd: repeal'd he shall be,
2770	And, though mine enemy, restored again
2771	To all his lands and signories: when he's return'd,
2772	Against Aumerle we will enforce his trial.
2773	
2774	BISHOP OF CARLISLE	That honourable day shall ne'er be seen.
2775	Many a time hath banish'd Norfolk fought
2776	For Jesu Christ in glorious Christian field,
2777	Streaming the ensign of the Christian cross
2778	Against black pagans, Turks, and Saracens:
2779	And toil'd with works of war, retired himself
2780	To Italy; and there at Venice gave
2781	His body to that pleasant country's earth,
2782	And his pure soul unto his captain Christ,
2783	Under whose colours he had fought so long.
2784	
2785	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Why, bishop, is Norfolk dead?
2786	
2787	BISHOP OF CARLISLE	As surely as I live, my lord.
2788	
2789	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Sweet peace conduct his sweet soul to the bosom
2790	Of good old Abraham! Lords appellants,
2791	Your differences shall all rest under gage
2792	Till we assign you to your days of trial.
2793	
2794	[Enter DUKE OF YORK, attended]
2795	
2796	DUKE OF YORK	Great Duke of Lancaster, I come to thee
2797	From plume-pluck'd Richard; who with willing soul
2798	Adopts thee heir, and his high sceptre yields
2799	To the possession of thy royal hand:
2800	Ascend his throne, descending now from him;
2801	And long live Henry, fourth of that name!
2802	
2803	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	In God's name, I'll ascend the regal throne.
2804	
2805	BISHOP OF CARLISLE	Marry. God forbid!
2806	Worst in this royal presence may I speak,
2807	Yet best beseeming me to speak the truth.
2808	Would God that any in this noble presence
2809	Were enough noble to be upright judge
2810	Of noble Richard! then true noblesse would
2811	Learn him forbearance from so foul a wrong.
2812	What subject can give sentence on his king?
2813	And who sits here that is not Richard's subject?
2814	Thieves are not judged but they are by to hear,
2815	Although apparent guilt be seen in them;
2816	And shall the figure of God's majesty,
2817	His captain, steward, deputy-elect,
2818	Anointed, crowned, planted many years,
2819	Be judged by subject and inferior breath,
2820	And he himself not present? O, forfend it, God,
2821	That in a Christian climate souls refined
2822	Should show so heinous, black, obscene a deed!
2823	I speak to subjects, and a subject speaks,
2824	Stirr'd up by God, thus boldly for his king:
2825	My Lord of Hereford here, whom you call king,
2826	Is a foul traitor to proud Hereford's king:
2827	And if you crown him, let me prophesy:
2828	The blood of English shall manure the ground,
2829	And future ages groan for this foul act;
2830	Peace shall go sleep with Turks and infidels,
2831	And in this seat of peace tumultuous wars
2832	Shall kin with kin and kind with kind confound;
2833	Disorder, horror, fear and mutiny
2834	Shall here inhabit, and this land be call'd
2835	The field of Golgotha and dead men's skulls.
2836	O, if you raise this house against this house,
2837	It will the woefullest division prove
2838	That ever fell upon this cursed earth.
2839	Prevent it, resist it, let it not be so,
2840	Lest child, child's children, cry against you woe!
2841	
2842	NORTHUMBERLAND	Well have you argued, sir; and, for your pains,
2843	Of capital treason we arrest you here.
2844	My Lord of Westminster, be it your charge
2845	To keep him safely till his day of trial.
2846	May it please you, lords, to grant the commons' suit.
2847	
2848	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Fetch hither Richard, that in common view
2849	He may surrender; so we shall proceed
2850	Without suspicion.
2851	
2852	DUKE OF YORK	                  I will be his conduct.
2853	
2854	[Exit]
2855	
2856	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Lords, you that here are under our arrest,
2857	Procure your sureties for your days of answer.
2858	Little are we beholding to your love,
2859	And little look'd for at your helping hands.
2860	
2861	[Re-enter DUKE OF YORK, with KING RICHARD II, and
2862	Officers bearing the regalia]
2863	
2864	KING RICHARD II	Alack, why am I sent for to a king,
2865	Before I have shook off the regal thoughts
2866	Wherewith I reign'd? I hardly yet have learn'd
2867	To insinuate, flatter, bow, and bend my limbs:
2868	Give sorrow leave awhile to tutor me
2869	To this submission. Yet I well remember
2870	The favours of these men: were they not mine?
2871	Did they not sometime cry, 'all hail!' to me?
2872	So Judas did to Christ: but he, in twelve,
2873	Found truth in all but one: I, in twelve thousand, none.
2874	God save the king! Will no man say amen?
2875	Am I both priest and clerk? well then, amen.
2876	God save the king! although I be not he;
2877	And yet, amen, if heaven do think him me.
2878	To do what service am I sent for hither?
2879	
2880	DUKE OF YORK	To do that office of thine own good will
2881	Which tired majesty did make thee offer,
2882	The resignation of thy state and crown
2883	To Henry Bolingbroke.
2884	
2885	KING RICHARD II	Give me the crown. Here, cousin, seize the crown;
2886	Here cousin:
2887	On this side my hand, and on that side yours.
2888	Now is this golden crown like a deep well
2889	That owes two buckets, filling one another,
2890	The emptier ever dancing in the air,
2891	The other down, unseen and full of water:
2892	That bucket down and full of tears am I,
2893	Drinking my griefs, whilst you mount up on high.
2894	
2895	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I thought you had been willing to resign.
2896	
2897	KING RICHARD II	My crown I am; but still my griefs are mine:
2898	You may my glories and my state depose,
2899	But not my griefs; still am I king of those.
2900	
2901	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Part of your cares you give me with your crown.
2902	
2903	KING RICHARD II	Your cares set up do not pluck my cares down.
2904	My care is loss of care, by old care done;
2905	Your care is gain of care, by new care won:
2906	The cares I give I have, though given away;
2907	They tend the crown, yet still with me they stay.
2908	
2909	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Are you contented to resign the crown?
2910	
2911	KING RICHARD II	Ay, no; no, ay; for I must nothing be;
2912	Therefore no no, for I resign to thee.
2913	Now mark me, how I will undo myself;
2914	I give this heavy weight from off my head
2915	And this unwieldy sceptre from my hand,
2916	The pride of kingly sway from out my heart;
2917	With mine own tears I wash away my balm,
2918	With mine own hands I give away my crown,
2919	With mine own tongue deny my sacred state,
2920	With mine own breath release all duty's rites:
2921	All pomp and majesty I do forswear;
2922	My manors, rents, revenues I forego;
2923	My acts, decrees, and statutes I deny:
2924	God pardon all oaths that are broke to me!
2925	God keep all vows unbroke that swear to thee!
2926	Make me, that nothing have, with nothing grieved,
2927	And thou with all pleased, that hast all achieved!
2928	Long mayst thou live in Richard's seat to sit,
2929	And soon lie Richard in an earthly pit!
2930	God save King Harry, unking'd Richard says,
2931	And send him many years of sunshine days!
2932	What more remains?
2933	
2934	NORTHUMBERLAND	                  No more, but that you read
2935	These accusations and these grievous crimes
2936	Committed by your person and your followers
2937	Against the state and profit of this land;
2938	That, by confessing them, the souls of men
2939	May deem that you are worthily deposed.
2940	
2941	KING RICHARD II	Must I do so? and must I ravel out
2942	My weaved-up folly? Gentle Northumberland,
2943	If thy offences were upon record,
2944	Would it not shame thee in so fair a troop
2945	To read a lecture of them? If thou wouldst,
2946	There shouldst thou find one heinous article,
2947	Containing the deposing of a king
2948	And cracking the strong warrant of an oath,
2949	Mark'd with a blot, damn'd in the book of heaven:
2950	Nay, all of you that stand and look upon,
2951	Whilst that my wretchedness doth bait myself,
2952	Though some of you with Pilate wash your hands
2953	Showing an outward pity; yet you Pilates
2954	Have here deliver'd me to my sour cross,
2955	And water cannot wash away your sin.
2956	
2957	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, dispatch; read o'er these articles.
2958	
2959	KING RICHARD II	Mine eyes are full of tears, I cannot see:
2960	And yet salt water blinds them not so much
2961	But they can see a sort of traitors here.
2962	Nay, if I turn mine eyes upon myself,
2963	I find myself a traitor with the rest;
2964	For I have given here my soul's consent
2965	To undeck the pompous body of a king;
2966	Made glory base and sovereignty a slave,
2967	Proud majesty a subject, state a peasant.
2968	
2969	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord,--
2970	
2971	KING RICHARD II	No lord of thine, thou haught insulting man,
2972	Nor no man's lord; I have no name, no title,
2973	No, not that name was given me at the font,
2974	But 'tis usurp'd: alack the heavy day,
2975	That I have worn so many winters out,
2976	And know not now what name to call myself!
2977	O that I were a mockery king of snow,
2978	Standing before the sun of Bolingbroke,
2979	To melt myself away in water-drops!
2980	Good king, great king, and yet not greatly good,
2981	An if my word be sterling yet in England,
2982	Let it command a mirror hither straight,
2983	That it may show me what a face I have,
2984	Since it is bankrupt of his majesty.
2985	
2986	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Go some of you and fetch a looking-glass.
2987	
2988	[Exit an attendant]
2989	
2990	NORTHUMBERLAND	Read o'er this paper while the glass doth come.
2991	
2992	KING RICHARD II	Fiend, thou torment'st me ere I come to hell!
2993	
2994	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Urge it no more, my Lord Northumberland.
2995	
2996	NORTHUMBERLAND	The commons will not then be satisfied.
2997	
2998	KING RICHARD II	They shall be satisfied: I'll read enough,
2999	When I do see the very book indeed
3000	Where all my sins are writ, and that's myself.
3001	
3002	[Re-enter Attendant, with a glass]
3003	
3004	Give me the glass, and therein will I read.
3005	No deeper wrinkles yet? hath sorrow struck
3006	So many blows upon this face of mine,
3007	And made no deeper wounds? O flattering glass,
3008	Like to my followers in prosperity,
3009	Thou dost beguile me! Was this face the face
3010	That every day under his household roof
3011	Did keep ten thousand men? was this the face
3012	That, like the sun, did make beholders wink?
3013	Was this the face that faced so many follies,
3014	And was at last out-faced by Bolingbroke?
3015	A brittle glory shineth in this face:
3016	As brittle as the glory is the face;
3017	
3018	[Dashes the glass against the ground]
3019	
3020	For there it is, crack'd in a hundred shivers.
3021	Mark, silent king, the moral of this sport,
3022	How soon my sorrow hath destroy'd my face.
3023	
3024	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	The shadow of your sorrow hath destroy'd
3025	The shadow or your face.
3026	
3027	KING RICHARD II	Say that again.
3028	The shadow of my sorrow! ha! let's see:
3029	'Tis very true, my grief lies all within;
3030	And these external manners of laments
3031	Are merely shadows to the unseen grief
3032	That swells with silence in the tortured soul;
3033	There lies the substance: and I thank thee, king,
3034	For thy great bounty, that not only givest
3035	Me cause to wail but teachest me the way
3036	How to lament the cause. I'll beg one boon,
3037	And then be gone and trouble you no more.
3038	Shall I obtain it?
3039	
3040	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	                  Name it, fair cousin.
3041	
3042	KING RICHARD II	'Fair cousin'? I am greater than a king:
3043	For when I was a king, my flatterers
3044	Were then but subjects; being now a subject,
3045	I have a king here to my flatterer.
3046	Being so great, I have no need to beg.
3047	
3048	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Yet ask.
3049	
3050	KING RICHARD II	And shall I have?
3051	
3052	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	You shall.
3053	
3054	KING RICHARD II	Then give me leave to go.
3055	
3056	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Whither?
3057	
3058	KING RICHARD II	Whither you will, so I were from your sights.
3059	
3060	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Go, some of you convey him to the Tower.
3061	
3062	KING RICHARD II	O, good! convey? conveyers are you all,
3063	That rise thus nimbly by a true king's fall.
3064	
3065	[Exeunt KING RICHARD II, some Lords, and a Guard]
3066	
3067	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	On Wednesday next we solemnly set down
3068	Our coronation: lords, prepare yourselves.
3069	
3070	[Exeunt all except the BISHOP OF CARLISLE, the Abbot
3071	of Westminster, and DUKE OF AUMERLE]
3072	
3073	Abbot	A woeful pageant have we here beheld.
3074	
3075	BISHOP OF CARLISLE	The woe's to come; the children yet unborn.
3076	Shall feel this day as sharp to them as thorn.
3077	
3078	DUKE OF AUMERLE	You holy clergymen, is there no plot
3079	To rid the realm of this pernicious blot?
3080	
3081	Abbot	My lord,
3082	Before I freely speak my mind herein,
3083	You shall not only take the sacrament
3084	To bury mine intents, but also to effect
3085	Whatever I shall happen to devise.
3086	I see your brows are full of discontent,
3087	Your hearts of sorrow and your eyes of tears:
3088	Come home with me to supper; and I'll lay
3089	A plot shall show us all a merry day.
3090	
3091	[Exeunt]

3096	KING RICHARD II
3097	
3098	
3099	ACT V
3100	
3101	
3102	
3103	SCENE I	London. A street leading to the Tower.
3104	
3105	
3106	[Enter QUEEN and Ladies]
3107	
3108	QUEEN	This way the king will come; this is the way
3109	To Julius Caesar's ill-erected tower,
3110	To whose flint bosom my condemned lord
3111	Is doom'd a prisoner by proud Bolingbroke:
3112	Here let us rest, if this rebellious earth
3113	Have any resting for her true king's queen.
3114	
3115	[Enter KING RICHARD II and Guard]
3116	
3117	But soft, but see, or rather do not see,
3118	My fair rose wither: yet look up, behold,
3119	That you in pity may dissolve to dew,
3120	And wash him fresh again with true-love tears.
3121	Ah, thou, the model where old Troy did stand,
3122	Thou map of honour, thou King Richard's tomb,
3123	And not King Richard; thou most beauteous inn,
3124	Why should hard-favour'd grief be lodged in thee,
3125	When triumph is become an alehouse guest?
3126	
3127	KING RICHARD II	Join not with grief, fair woman, do not so,
3128	To make my end too sudden: learn, good soul,
3129	To think our former state a happy dream;
3130	From which awaked, the truth of what we are
3131	Shows us but this: I am sworn brother, sweet,
3132	To grim Necessity, and he and I
3133	Will keep a league till death. Hie thee to France
3134	And cloister thee in some religious house:
3135	Our holy lives must win a new world's crown,
3136	Which our profane hours here have stricken down.
3137	
3138	QUEEN	What, is my Richard both in shape and mind
3139	Transform'd and weaken'd? hath Bolingbroke deposed
3140	Thine intellect? hath he been in thy heart?
3141	The lion dying thrusteth forth his paw,
3142	And wounds the earth, if nothing else, with rage
3143	To be o'erpower'd; and wilt thou, pupil-like,
3144	Take thy correction mildly, kiss the rod,
3145	And fawn on rage with base humility,
3146	Which art a lion and a king of beasts?
3147	
3148	KING RICHARD II	A king of beasts, indeed; if aught but beasts,
3149	I had been still a happy king of men.
3150	Good sometime queen, prepare thee hence for France:
3151	Think I am dead and that even here thou takest,
3152	As from my death-bed, thy last living leave.
3153	In winter's tedious nights sit by the fire
3154	With good old folks and let them tell thee tales
3155	Of woeful ages long ago betid;
3156	And ere thou bid good night, to quit their griefs,
3157	Tell thou the lamentable tale of me
3158	And send the hearers weeping to their beds:
3159	For why, the senseless brands will sympathize
3160	The heavy accent of thy moving tongue
3161	And in compassion weep the fire out;
3162	And some will mourn in ashes, some coal-black,
3163	For the deposing of a rightful king.
3164	
3165	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND and others]
3166	
3167	NORTHUMBERLAND	My lord, the mind of Bolingbroke is changed:
3168	You must to Pomfret, not unto the Tower.
3169	And, madam, there is order ta'en for you;
3170	With all swift speed you must away to France.
3171	
3172	KING RICHARD II	Northumberland, thou ladder wherewithal
3173	The mounting Bolingbroke ascends my throne,
3174	The time shall not be many hours of age
3175	More than it is ere foul sin gathering head
3176	Shalt break into corruption: thou shalt think,
3177	Though he divide the realm and give thee half,
3178	It is too little, helping him to all;
3179	And he shall think that thou, which know'st the way
3180	To plant unrightful kings, wilt know again,
3181	Being ne'er so little urged, another way
3182	To pluck him headlong from the usurped throne.
3183	The love of wicked men converts to fear;
3184	That fear to hate, and hate turns one or both
3185	To worthy danger and deserved death.
3186	
3187	NORTHUMBERLAND	My guilt be on my head, and there an end.
3188	Take leave and part; for you must part forthwith.
3189	
3190	KING RICHARD II	Doubly divorced! Bad men, you violate
3191	A twofold marriage, 'twixt my crown and me,
3192	And then betwixt me and my married wife.
3193	Let me unkiss the oath 'twixt thee and me;
3194	And yet not so, for with a kiss 'twas made.
3195	Part us, Northumberland; I toward the north,
3196	Where shivering cold and sickness pines the clime;
3197	My wife to France: from whence, set forth in pomp,
3198	She came adorned hither like sweet May,
3199	Sent back like Hallowmas or short'st of day.
3200	
3201	QUEEN	And must we be divided? must we part?
3202	
3203	KING RICHARD II	Ay, hand from hand, my love, and heart from heart.
3204	
3205	QUEEN	Banish us both and send the king with me.
3206	
3207	NORTHUMBERLAND	That were some love but little policy.
3208	
3209	QUEEN	Then whither he goes, thither let me go.
3210	
3211	KING RICHARD II	So two, together weeping, make one woe.
3212	Weep thou for me in France, I for thee here;
3213	Better far off than near, be ne'er the near.
3214	Go, count thy way with sighs; I mine with groans.
3215	
3216	QUEEN	So longest way shall have the longest moans.
3217	
3218	KING RICHARD II	Twice for one step I'll groan, the way being short,
3219	And piece the way out with a heavy heart.
3220	Come, come, in wooing sorrow let's be brief,
3221	Since, wedding it, there is such length in grief;
3222	One kiss shall stop our mouths, and dumbly part;
3223	Thus give I mine, and thus take I thy heart.
3224	
3225	QUEEN	Give me mine own again; 'twere no good part
3226	To take on me to keep and kill thy heart.
3227	So, now I have mine own again, be gone,
3228	That I might strive to kill it with a groan.
3229	
3230	KING RICHARD II	We make woe wanton with this fond delay:
3231	Once more, adieu; the rest let sorrow say.
3232

3241	ACT V
3242	
3243	
3244	
3245	SCENE II	The DUKE OF YORK's palace.
3246	
3247	
3248	[Enter DUKE OF YORK and DUCHESS OF YORK]
3249	
3250	DUCHESS OF YORK	My lord, you told me you would tell the rest,
3251	When weeping made you break the story off,
3252	of our two cousins coming into London.
3253	
3254	DUKE OF YORK	Where did I leave?
3255	
3256	DUCHESS OF YORK	                  At that sad stop, my lord,
3257	Where rude misgovern'd hands from windows' tops
3258	Threw dust and rubbish on King Richard's head.
3259	
3260	DUKE OF YORK	Then, as I said, the duke, great Bolingbroke,
3261	Mounted upon a hot and fiery steed
3262	Which his aspiring rider seem'd to know,
3263	With slow but stately pace kept on his course,
3264	Whilst all tongues cried 'God save thee,
3265	Bolingbroke!'
3266	You would have thought the very windows spake,
3267	So many greedy looks of young and old
3268	Through casements darted their desiring eyes
3269	Upon his visage, and that all the walls
3270	With painted imagery had said at once
3271	'Jesu preserve thee! welcome, Bolingbroke!'
3272	Whilst he, from the one side to the other turning,
3273	Bareheaded, lower than his proud steed's neck,
3274	Bespake them thus: 'I thank you, countrymen:'
3275	And thus still doing, thus he pass'd along.
3276	
3277	DUCHESS OF YORK	Alack, poor Richard! where rode he the whilst?
3278	
3279	DUKE OF YORK	As in a theatre, the eyes of men,
3280	After a well-graced actor leaves the stage,
3281	Are idly bent on him that enters next,
3282	Thinking his prattle to be tedious;
3283	Even so, or with much more contempt, men's eyes
3284	Did scowl on gentle Richard; no man cried 'God save him!'
3285	No joyful tongue gave him his welcome home:
3286	But dust was thrown upon his sacred head:
3287	Which with such gentle sorrow he shook off,
3288	His face still combating with tears and smiles,
3289	The badges of his grief and patience,
3290	That had not God, for some strong purpose, steel'd
3291	The hearts of men, they must perforce have melted
3292	And barbarism itself have pitied him.
3293	But heaven hath a hand in these events,
3294	To whose high will we bound our calm contents.
3295	To Bolingbroke are we sworn subjects now,
3296	Whose state and honour I for aye allow.
3297	
3298	DUCHESS OF YORK	Here comes my son Aumerle.
3299	
3300	DUKE OF YORK	Aumerle that was;
3301	But that is lost for being Richard's friend,
3302	And, madam, you must call him Rutland now:
3303	I am in parliament pledge for his truth
3304	And lasting fealty to the new-made king.
3305	
3306	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]
3307	
3308	DUCHESS OF YORK	Welcome, my son: who are the violets now
3309	That strew the green lap of the new come spring?
3310	
3311	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Madam, I know not, nor I greatly care not:
3312	God knows I had as lief be none as one.
3313	
3314	DUKE OF YORK	Well, bear you well in this new spring of time,
3315	Lest you be cropp'd before you come to prime.
3316	What news from Oxford? hold those justs and triumphs?
3317	
3318	DUKE OF AUMERLE	For aught I know, my lord, they do.
3319	
3320	DUKE OF YORK	You will be there, I know.
3321	
3322	DUKE OF AUMERLE	If God prevent not, I purpose so.
3323	
3324	DUKE OF YORK	What seal is that, that hangs without thy bosom?
3325	Yea, look'st thou pale? let me see the writing.
3326	
3327	DUKE OF AUMERLE	My lord, 'tis nothing.
3328	
3329	DUKE OF YORK	No matter, then, who see it;
3330	I will be satisfied; let me see the writing.
3331	
3332	DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech your grace to pardon me:
3333	It is a matter of small consequence,
3334	Which for some reasons I would not have seen.
3335	
3336	DUKE OF YORK	Which for some reasons, sir, I mean to see.
3337	I fear, I fear,--
3338	
3339	DUCHESS OF YORK	                  What should you fear?
3340	'Tis nothing but some bond, that he is enter'd into
3341	For gay apparel 'gainst the triumph day.
3342	
3343	DUKE OF YORK	Bound to himself! what doth he with a bond
3344	That he is bound to? Wife, thou art a fool.
3345	Boy, let me see the writing.
3346	
3347	DUKE OF AUMERLE	I do beseech you, pardon me; I may not show it.
3348	
3349	DUKE OF YORK	I will be satisfied; let me see it, I say.
3350	
3351	[He plucks it out of his bosom and reads it]
3352	
3353	Treason! foul treason! Villain! traitor! slave!
3354	
3355	DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter, my lord?
3356	
3357	DUKE OF YORK	Ho! who is within there?
3358	
3359	[Enter a Servant]
3360	
3361	Saddle my horse.
3362	God for his mercy, what treachery is here!
3363	
3364	DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, what is it, my lord?
3365	
3366	DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say; saddle my horse.
3367	Now, by mine honour, by my life, by my troth,
3368	I will appeach the villain.
3369	
3370	DUCHESS OF YORK	What is the matter?
3371	
3372	DUKE OF YORK	Peace, foolish woman.
3373	
3374	DUCHESS OF YORK	I will not peace. What is the matter, Aumerle.
3375	
3376	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Good mother, be content; it is no more
3377	Than my poor life must answer.
3378	
3379	DUCHESS OF YORK	Thy life answer!
3380	
3381	DUKE OF YORK	Bring me my boots: I will unto the king.
3382	
3383	[Re-enter Servant with boots]
3384	
3385	DUCHESS OF YORK	Strike him, Aumerle. Poor boy, thou art amazed.
3386	Hence, villain! never more come in my sight.
3387	
3388	DUKE OF YORK	Give me my boots, I say.
3389	
3390	DUCHESS OF YORK	Why, York, what wilt thou do?
3391	Wilt thou not hide the trespass of thine own?
3392	Have we more sons? or are we like to have?
3393	Is not my teeming date drunk up with time?
3394	And wilt thou pluck my fair son from mine age,
3395	And rob me of a happy mother's name?
3396	Is he not like thee? is he not thine own?
3397	
3398	DUKE OF YORK	Thou fond mad woman,
3399	Wilt thou conceal this dark conspiracy?
3400	A dozen of them here have ta'en the sacrament,
3401	And interchangeably set down their hands,
3402	To kill the king at Oxford.
3403	
3404	DUCHESS OF YORK	He shall be none;
3405	We'll keep him here: then what is that to him?
3406	
3407	DUKE OF YORK	Away, fond woman! were he twenty times my son,
3408	I would appeach him.
3409	
3410	DUCHESS OF YORK	Hadst thou groan'd for him
3411	As I have done, thou wouldst be more pitiful.
3412	But now I know thy mind; thou dost suspect
3413	That I have been disloyal to thy bed,
3414	And that he is a bastard, not thy son:
3415	Sweet York, sweet husband, be not of that mind:
3416	He is as like thee as a man may be,
3417	Not like to me, or any of my kin,
3418	And yet I love him.
3419	
3420	DUKE OF YORK	Make way, unruly woman!
3421	
3422	[Exit]
3423	
3424	DUCHESS OF YORK	After, Aumerle! mount thee upon his horse;
3425	Spur post, and get before him to the king,
3426	And beg thy pardon ere he do accuse thee.
3427	I'll not be long behind; though I be old,
3428	I doubt not but to ride as fast as York:
3429	And never will I rise up from the ground
3430	Till Bolingbroke have pardon'd thee. Away, be gone!

3444	SCENE III	A royal palace.
3445	
3446	
3447	[Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, HENRY PERCY, and other Lords]
3448	
3449	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Can no man tell me of my unthrifty son?
3450	'Tis full three months since I did see him last;
3451	If any plague hang over us, 'tis he.
3452	I would to God, my lords, he might be found:
3453	Inquire at London, 'mongst the taverns there,
3454	For there, they say, he daily doth frequent,
3455	With unrestrained loose companions,
3456	Even such, they say, as stand in narrow lanes,
3457	And beat our watch, and rob our passengers;
3458	Which he, young wanton and effeminate boy,
3459	Takes on the point of honour to support
3460	So dissolute a crew.
3461	
3462	HENRY PERCY	My lord, some two days since I saw the prince,
3463	And told him of those triumphs held at Oxford.
3464	
3465	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	And what said the gallant?
3466	
3467	HENRY PERCY	His answer was, he would unto the stews,
3468	And from the common'st creature pluck a glove,
3469	And wear it as a favour; and with that
3470	He would unhorse the lustiest challenger.
3471	
3472	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	As dissolute as desperate; yet through both
3473	I see some sparks of better hope, which elder years
3474	May happily bring forth. But who comes here?
3475	
3476	[Enter DUKE OF AUMERLE]
3477	
3478	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Where is the king?
3479	
3480	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What means our cousin, that he stares and looks
3481	So wildly?
3482	
3483	DUKE OF AUMERLE	God save your grace! I do beseech your majesty,
3484	To have some conference with your grace alone.
3485	
3486	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Withdraw yourselves, and leave us here alone.
3487	
3488	[Exeunt HENRY PERCY and Lords]
3489	
3490	What is the matter with our cousin now?
3491	
3492	DUKE OF AUMERLE	For ever may my knees grow to the earth,
3493	My tongue cleave to my roof within my mouth
3494	Unless a pardon ere I rise or speak.
3495	
3496	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Intended or committed was this fault?
3497	If on the first, how heinous e'er it be,
3498	To win thy after-love I pardon thee.
3499	
3500	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Then give me leave that I may turn the key,
3501	That no man enter till my tale be done.
3502	
3503	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Have thy desire.
3504	
3505	DUKE OF YORK	[Within]  My liege, beware; look to thyself;
3506	Thou hast a traitor in thy presence there.
3507	
3508	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Villain, I'll make thee safe.
3509	
3510	[Drawing]
3511	
3512	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Stay thy revengeful hand; thou hast no cause to fear.
3513	
3514	DUKE OF YORK	[Within]  Open the door, secure, foolhardy king:
3515	Shall I for love speak treason to thy face?
3516	Open the door, or I will break it open.
3517	
3518	[Enter DUKE OF YORK]
3519	
3520	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What is the matter, uncle? speak;
3521	Recover breath; tell us how near is danger,
3522	That we may arm us to encounter it.
3523	
3524	DUKE OF YORK	Peruse this writing here, and thou shalt know
3525	The treason that my haste forbids me show.
3526	
3527	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Remember, as thou read'st, thy promise pass'd:
3528	I do repent me; read not my name there
3529	My heart is not confederate with my hand.
3530	
3531	DUKE OF YORK	It was, villain, ere thy hand did set it down.
3532	I tore it from the traitor's bosom, king;
3533	Fear, and not love, begets his penitence:
3534	Forget to pity him, lest thy pity prove
3535	A serpent that will sting thee to the heart.
3536	
3537	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	O heinous, strong and bold conspiracy!
3538	O loyal father of a treacherous son!
3539	Thou sheer, immaculate and silver fountain,
3540	From when this stream through muddy passages
3541	Hath held his current and defiled himself!
3542	Thy overflow of good converts to bad,
3543	And thy abundant goodness shall excuse
3544	This deadly blot in thy digressing son.
3545	
3546	DUKE OF YORK	So shall my virtue be his vice's bawd;
3547	And he shall spend mine honour with his shame,
3548	As thriftless sons their scraping fathers' gold.
3549	Mine honour lives when his dishonour dies,
3550	Or my shamed life in his dishonour lies:
3551	Thou kill'st me in his life; giving him breath,
3552	The traitor lives, the true man's put to death.
3553	
3554	DUCHESS OF YORK	[Within]  What ho, my liege! for God's sake,
3555	let me in.
3556	
3557	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	What shrill-voiced suppliant makes this eager cry?
3558	
3559	DUCHESS OF YORK	A woman, and thy aunt, great king; 'tis I.
3560	Speak with me, pity me, open the door.
3561	A beggar begs that never begg'd before.
3562	
3563	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Our scene is alter'd from a serious thing,
3564	And now changed to 'The Beggar and the King.'
3565	My dangerous cousin, let your mother in:
3566	I know she is come to pray for your foul sin.
3567	
3568	DUKE OF YORK	If thou do pardon, whosoever pray,
3569	More sins for this forgiveness prosper may.
3570	This fester'd joint cut off, the rest rest sound;
3571	This let alone will all the rest confound.
3572	
3573	[Enter DUCHESS OF YORK]
3574	
3575	DUCHESS OF YORK	O king, believe not this hard-hearted man!
3576	Love loving not itself none other can.
3577	
3578	DUKE OF YORK	Thou frantic woman, what dost thou make here?
3579	Shall thy old dugs once more a traitor rear?
3580	
3581	DUCHESS OF YORK	Sweet York, be patient. Hear me, gentle liege.
3582	
3583	[Kneels]
3584	
3585	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Rise up, good aunt.
3586	
3587	DUCHESS OF YORK	Not yet, I thee beseech:
3588	For ever will I walk upon my knees,
3589	And never see day that the happy sees,
3590	Till thou give joy; until thou bid me joy,
3591	By pardoning Rutland, my transgressing boy.
3592	
3593	DUKE OF AUMERLE	Unto my mother's prayers I bend my knee.
3594	
3595	DUKE OF YORK	Against them both my true joints bended be.
3596	Ill mayst thou thrive, if thou grant any grace!
3597	
3598	DUCHESS OF YORK	Pleads he in earnest? look upon his face;
3599	His eyes do drop no tears, his prayers are in jest;
3600	His words come from his mouth, ours from our breast:
3601	He prays but faintly and would be denied;
3602	We pray with heart and soul and all beside:
3603	His weary joints would gladly rise, I know;
3604	Our knees shall kneel till to the ground they grow:
3605	His prayers are full of false hypocrisy;
3606	Ours of true zeal and deep integrity.
3607	Our prayers do out-pray his; then let them have
3608	That mercy which true prayer ought to have.
3609	
3610	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.
3611	
3612	DUCHESS OF YORK	Nay, do not say, 'stand up;'
3613	Say, 'pardon' first, and afterwards 'stand up.'
3614	And if I were thy nurse, thy tongue to teach,
3615	'Pardon' should be the first word of thy speech.
3616	I never long'd to hear a word till now;
3617	Say 'pardon,' king; let pity teach thee how:
3618	The word is short, but not so short as sweet;
3619	No word like 'pardon' for kings' mouths so meet.
3620	
3621	DUKE OF YORK	Speak it in French, king; say, 'pardonne moi.'
3622	
3623	DUCHESS OF YORK	Dost thou teach pardon pardon to destroy?
3624	Ah, my sour husband, my hard-hearted lord,
3625	That set'st the word itself against the word!
3626	Speak 'pardon' as 'tis current in our land;
3627	The chopping French we do not understand.
3628	Thine eye begins to speak; set thy tongue there;
3629	Or in thy piteous heart plant thou thine ear;
3630	That hearing how our plaints and prayers do pierce,
3631	Pity may move thee 'pardon' to rehearse.
3632	
3633	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Good aunt, stand up.
3634	
3635	DUCHESS OF YORK	I do not sue to stand;
3636	Pardon is all the suit I have in hand.
3637	
3638	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	I pardon him, as God shall pardon me.
3639	
3640	DUCHESS OF YORK	O happy vantage of a kneeling knee!
3641	Yet am I sick for fear: speak it again;
3642	Twice saying 'pardon' doth not pardon twain,
3643	But makes one pardon strong.
3644	
3645	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	With all my heart
3646	I pardon him.
3647	
3648	DUCHESS OF YORK	                  A god on earth thou art.
3649	
3650	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	But for our trusty brother-in-law and the abbot,
3651	With all the rest of that consorted crew,
3652	Destruction straight shall dog them at the heels.
3653	Good uncle, help to order several powers
3654	To Oxford, or where'er these traitors are:
3655	They shall not live within this world, I swear,
3656	But I will have them, if I once know where.
3657	Uncle, farewell: and, cousin too, adieu:
3658	Your mother well hath pray'd, and prove you true.
3659	
3660	DUCHESS OF YORK	Come, my old son: I pray God make thee new.

3674	SCENE IV	The same.
3675	
3676	
3677	[Enter EXTON and Servant]
3678	
3679	EXTON	Didst thou not mark the king, what words he spake,
3680	'Have I no friend will rid me of this living fear?'
3681	Was it not so?
3682	
3683	Servant	                  These were his very words.
3684	
3685	EXTON	'Have I no friend?' quoth he: he spake it twice,
3686	And urged it twice together, did he not?
3687	
3688	Servant	He did.
3689	
3690	EXTON	And speaking it, he wistly look'd on me,
3691	And who should say, 'I would thou wert the man'
3692	That would divorce this terror from my heart;'
3693	Meaning the king at Pomfret. Come, let's go:
3694	I am the king's friend, and will rid his foe.

3702	
3703	
3704	ACT V
3705	
3706	
3707	
3708	SCENE V	Pomfret castle.
3709	
3710	
3711	[Enter KING RICHARD]
3712	
3713	KING RICHARD II	I have been studying how I may compare
3714	This prison where I live unto the world:
3715	And for because the world is populous
3716	And here is not a creature but myself,
3717	I cannot do it; yet I'll hammer it out.
3718	My brain I'll prove the female to my soul,
3719	My soul the father; and these two beget
3720	A generation of still-breeding thoughts,
3721	And these same thoughts people this little world,
3722	In humours like the people of this world,
3723	For no thought is contented. The better sort,
3724	As thoughts of things divine, are intermix'd
3725	With scruples and do set the word itself
3726	Against the word:
3727	As thus, 'Come, little ones,' and then again,
3728	'It is as hard to come as for a camel
3729	To thread the postern of a small needle's eye.'
3730	Thoughts tending to ambition, they do plot
3731	Unlikely wonders; how these vain weak nails
3732	May tear a passage through the flinty ribs
3733	Of this hard world, my ragged prison walls,
3734	And, for they cannot, die in their own pride.
3735	Thoughts tending to content flatter themselves
3736	That they are not the first of fortune's slaves,
3737	Nor shall not be the last; like silly beggars
3738	Who sitting in the stocks refuge their shame,
3739	That many have and others must sit there;
3740	And in this thought they find a kind of ease,
3741	Bearing their own misfortunes on the back
3742	Of such as have before endured the like.
3743	Thus play I in one person many people,
3744	And none contented: sometimes am I king;
3745	Then treasons make me wish myself a beggar,
3746	And so I am: then crushing penury
3747	Persuades me I was better when a king;
3748	Then am I king'd again: and by and by
3749	Think that I am unking'd by Bolingbroke,
3750	And straight am nothing: but whate'er I be,
3751	Nor I nor any man that but man is
3752	With nothing shall be pleased, till he be eased
3753	With being nothing. Music do I hear?
3754	
3755	[Music]
3756	
3757	Ha, ha! keep time: how sour sweet music is,
3758	When time is broke and no proportion kept!
3759	So is it in the music of men's lives.
3760	And here have I the daintiness of ear
3761	To cheque time broke in a disorder'd string;
3762	But for the concord of my state and time
3763	Had not an ear to hear my true time broke.
3764	I wasted time, and now doth time waste me;
3765	For now hath time made me his numbering clock:
3766	My thoughts are minutes; and with sighs they jar
3767	Their watches on unto mine eyes, the outward watch,
3768	Whereto my finger, like a dial's point,
3769	Is pointing still, in cleansing them from tears.
3770	Now sir, the sound that tells what hour it is
3771	Are clamorous groans, which strike upon my heart,
3772	Which is the bell: so sighs and tears and groans
3773	Show minutes, times, and hours: but my time
3774	Runs posting on in Bolingbroke's proud joy,
3775	While I stand fooling here, his Jack o' the clock.
3776	This music mads me; let it sound no more;
3777	For though it have holp madmen to their wits,
3778	In me it seems it will make wise men mad.
3779	Yet blessing on his heart that gives it me!
3780	For 'tis a sign of love; and love to Richard
3781	Is a strange brooch in this all-hating world.
3782	
3783	[Enter a Groom of the Stable]
3784	
3785	Groom	Hail, royal prince!
3786	
3787	KING RICHARD II	Thanks, noble peer;
3788	The cheapest of us is ten groats too dear.
3789	What art thou? and how comest thou hither,
3790	Where no man never comes but that sad dog
3791	That brings me food to make misfortune live?
3792	
3793	Groom	I was a poor groom of thy stable, king,
3794	When thou wert king; who, travelling towards York,
3795	With much ado at length have gotten leave
3796	To look upon my sometimes royal master's face.
3797	O, how it yearn'd my heart when I beheld
3798	In London streets, that coronation-day,
3799	When Bolingbroke rode on roan Barbary,
3800	That horse that thou so often hast bestrid,
3801	That horse that I so carefully have dress'd!
3802	
3803	KING RICHARD II	Rode he on Barbary? Tell me, gentle friend,
3804	How went he under him?
3805	
3806	Groom	So proudly as if he disdain'd the ground.
3807	
3808	KING RICHARD II	So proud that Bolingbroke was on his back!
3809	That jade hath eat bread from my royal hand;
3810	This hand hath made him proud with clapping him.
3811	Would he not stumble? would he not fall down,
3812	Since pride must have a fall, and break the neck
3813	Of that proud man that did usurp his back?
3814	Forgiveness, horse! why do I rail on thee,
3815	Since thou, created to be awed by man,
3816	Wast born to bear? I was not made a horse;
3817	And yet I bear a burthen like an ass,
3818	Spurr'd, gall'd and tired by jouncing Bolingbroke.
3819	
3820	[Enter Keeper, with a dish]
3821	
3822	Keeper	Fellow, give place; here is no longer stay.
3823	
3824	KING RICHARD II	If thou love me, 'tis time thou wert away.
3825	
3826	Groom	What my tongue dares not, that my heart shall say.
3827	
3828	[Exit]
3829	
3830	Keeper	My lord, will't please you to fall to?
3831	
3832	KING RICHARD II	Taste of it first, as thou art wont to do.
3833	
3834	Keeper	My lord, I dare not: Sir Pierce of Exton, who
3835	lately came from the king, commands the contrary.
3836	
3837	KING RICHARD II	The devil take Henry of Lancaster and thee!
3838	Patience is stale, and I am weary of it.
3839	
3840	[Beats the keeper]
3841	
3842	Keeper	Help, help, help!
3843	
3844	[Enter EXTON and Servants, armed]
3845	
3846	KING RICHARD II	How now! what means death in this rude assault?
3847	Villain, thy own hand yields thy death's instrument.
3848	
3849	[Snatching an axe from a Servant and killing him]
3850	
3851	Go thou, and fill another room in hell.
3852	
3853	[He kills another. Then Exton strikes him down]
3854	
3855	That hand shall burn in never-quenching fire
3856	That staggers thus my person. Exton, thy fierce hand
3857	Hath with the king's blood stain'd the king's own land.
3858	Mount, mount, my soul! thy seat is up on high;
3859	Whilst my gross flesh sinks downward, here to die.
3860	
3861	[Dies]
3862	
3863	EXTON	As full of valour as of royal blood:
3864	Both have I spill'd; O would the deed were good!
3865	For now the devil, that told me I did well,
3866	Says that this deed is chronicled in hell.
3867	This dead king to the living king I'll bear
3868	Take hence the rest, and give them burial here.
3869	
3870	[Exeunt]

3883	
3884	
3885	[Flourish. Enter HENRY BOLINGBROKE, DUKE OF YORK,
3886	with other Lords, and Attendants]
3887	
3888	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Kind uncle York, the latest news we hear
3889	Is that the rebels have consumed with fire
3890	Our town of Cicester in Gloucestershire;
3891	But whether they be ta'en or slain we hear not.
3892	
3893	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]
3894	
3895	Welcome, my lord	what is the news?
3896	
3897	NORTHUMBERLAND	First, to thy sacred state wish I all happiness.
3898	The next news is, I have to London sent
3899	The heads of Oxford, Salisbury, Blunt, and Kent:
3900	The manner of their taking may appear
3901	At large discoursed in this paper here.
3902	
3903	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	We thank thee, gentle Percy, for thy pains;
3904	And to thy worth will add right worthy gains.
3905	
3906	[Enter LORD FITZWATER]
3907	
3908	LORD FITZWATER	My lord, I have from Oxford sent to London
3909	The heads of Brocas and Sir Bennet Seely,
3910	Two of the dangerous consorted traitors
3911	That sought at Oxford thy dire overthrow.
3912	
3913	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Thy pains, Fitzwater, shall not be forgot;
3914	Right noble is thy merit, well I wot.
3915	
3916	[Enter HENRY PERCY, and the BISHOP OF CARLISLE]
3917	
3918	HENRY PERCY	The grand conspirator, Abbot of Westminster,
3919	With clog of conscience and sour melancholy
3920	Hath yielded up his body to the grave;
3921	But here is Carlisle living, to abide
3922	Thy kingly doom and sentence of his pride.
3923	
3924	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Carlisle, this is your doom:
3925	Choose out some secret place, some reverend room,
3926	More than thou hast, and with it joy thy life;
3927	So as thou livest in peace, die free from strife:
3928	For though mine enemy thou hast ever been,
3929	High sparks of honour in thee have I seen.
3930	
3931	[Enter EXTON, with persons bearing a coffin]
3932	
3933	EXTON	Great king, within this coffin I present
3934	Thy buried fear: herein all breathless lies
3935	The mightiest of thy greatest enemies,
3936	Richard of Bordeaux, by me hither brought.
3937	
3938	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	Exton, I thank thee not; for thou hast wrought
3939	A deed of slander with thy fatal hand
3940	Upon my head and all this famous land.
3941	
3942	EXTON	From your own mouth, my lord, did I this deed.
3943	
3944	HENRY BOLINGBROKE	They love not poison that do poison need,
3945	Nor do I thee: though I did wish him dead,
3946	I hate the murderer, love him murdered.
3947	The guilt of conscience take thou for thy labour,
3948	But neither my good word nor princely favour:
3949	With Cain go wander through shades of night,
3950	And never show thy head by day nor light.
3951	Lords, I protest, my soul is full of woe,
3952	That blood should sprinkle me to make me grow:
3953	Come, mourn with me for that I do lament,
3954	And put on sullen black incontinent:
3955	I'll make a voyage to the Holy Land,
3956	To wash this blood off from my guilty hand:
3957	March sadly after; grace my mournings here;
3958	In weeping after this untimely bier.
3959	
3960	[Exeunt]

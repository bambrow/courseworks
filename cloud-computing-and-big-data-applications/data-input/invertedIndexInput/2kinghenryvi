143	
144	SCENE I	London. The palace.
145	
146	
147	[Flourish of trumpets: then hautboys. Enter KING
148	HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER, SALISBURY, WARWICK, and
149	CARDINAL, on the one side; QUEEN MARGARET, SUFFOLK,
150	YORK, SOMERSET, and BUCKINGHAM, on the other]
151	
152	SUFFOLK	As by your high imperial majesty
153	I had in charge at my depart for France,
154	As procurator to your excellence,
155	To marry Princess Margaret for your grace,
156	So, in the famous ancient city, Tours,
157	In presence of the Kings of France and Sicil,
158	The Dukes of Orleans, Calaber, Bretagne and Alencon,
159	Seven earls, twelve barons and twenty reverend bishops,
160	I have perform'd my task and was espoused:
161	And humbly now upon my bended knee,
162	In sight of England and her lordly peers,
163	Deliver up my title in the queen
164	To your most gracious hands, that are the substance
165	Of that great shadow I did represent;
166	The happiest gift that ever marquess gave,
167	The fairest queen that ever king received.
168	
169	KING HENRY VI	Suffolk, arise. Welcome, Queen Margaret:
170	I can express no kinder sign of love
171	Than this kind kiss. O Lord, that lends me life,
172	Lend me a heart replete with thankfulness!
173	For thou hast given me in this beauteous face
174	A world of earthly blessings to my soul,
175	If sympathy of love unite our thoughts.
176	
177	QUEEN MARGARET	Great King of England and my gracious lord,
178	The mutual conference that my mind hath had,
179	By day, by night, waking and in my dreams,
180	In courtly company or at my beads,
181	With you, mine alder-liefest sovereign,
182	Makes me the bolder to salute my king
183	With ruder terms, such as my wit affords
184	And over-joy of heart doth minister.
185	
186	KING HENRY VI	Her sight did ravish; but her grace in speech,
187	Her words y-clad with wisdom's majesty,
188	Makes me from wondering fall to weeping joys;
189	Such is the fulness of my heart's content.
190	Lords, with one cheerful voice welcome my love.
191	
192	ALL	[Kneeling]  Long live Queen Margaret, England's
193	happiness!
194	
195	QUEEN MARGARET	We thank you all.
196	
197	[Flourish]
198	
199	SUFFOLK	My lord protector, so it please your grace,
200	Here are the articles of contracted peace
201	Between our sovereign and the French king Charles,
202	For eighteen months concluded by consent.
203	
204	GLOUCESTER	[Reads]  'Imprimis, it is agreed between the French
205	king Charles, and William de la Pole, Marquess of
206	Suffolk, ambassador for Henry King of England, that
207	the said Henry shall espouse the Lady Margaret,
208	daughter unto Reignier King of Naples, Sicilia and
209	Jerusalem, and crown her Queen of England ere the
210	thirtieth of May next ensuing. Item, that the duchy
211	of Anjou and the county of Maine shall be released
212	and delivered to the king her father'--
213	
214	[Lets the paper fall]
215	
216	KING HENRY VI	Uncle, how now!
217	
218	GLOUCESTER	       Pardon me, gracious lord;
219	Some sudden qualm hath struck me at the heart
220	And dimm'd mine eyes, that I can read no further.
221	
222	KING HENRY VI	Uncle of Winchester, I pray, read on.
223	
224	CARDINAL	[Reads]  'Item, It is further agreed between them,
225	that the duchies of Anjou and Maine shall be
226	released and delivered over to the king her father,
227	and she sent over of the King of England's own
228	proper cost and charges, without having any dowry.'
229	
230	KING HENRY VI	They please us well. Lord marquess, kneel down:
231	We here create thee the first duke of Suffolk,
232	And gird thee with the sword. Cousin of York,
233	We here discharge your grace from being regent
234	I' the parts of France, till term of eighteen months
235	Be full expired. Thanks, uncle Winchester,
236	Gloucester, York, Buckingham, Somerset,
237	Salisbury, and Warwick;
238	We thank you all for the great favour done,
239	In entertainment to my princely queen.
240	Come, let us in, and with all speed provide
241	To see her coronation be perform'd.
242	
243	[Exeunt KING HENRY VI, QUEEN MARGARET, and SUFFOLK]
244	
245	GLOUCESTER	Brave peers of England, pillars of the state,
246	To you Duke Humphrey must unload his grief,
247	Your grief, the common grief of all the land.
248	What! did my brother Henry spend his youth,
249	His valour, coin and people, in the wars?
250	Did he so often lodge in open field,
251	In winter's cold and summer's parching heat,
252	To conquer France, his true inheritance?
253	And did my brother Bedford toil his wits,
254	To keep by policy what Henry got?
255	Have you yourselves, Somerset, Buckingham,
256	Brave York, Salisbury, and victorious Warwick,
257	Received deep scars in France and Normandy?
258	Or hath mine uncle Beaufort and myself,
259	With all the learned council of the realm,
260	Studied so long, sat in the council-house
261	Early and late, debating to and fro
262	How France and Frenchmen might be kept in awe,
263	And had his highness in his infancy
264	Crowned in Paris in despite of foes?
265	And shall these labours and these honours die?
266	Shall Henry's conquest, Bedford's vigilance,
267	Your deeds of war and all our counsel die?
268	O peers of England, shameful is this league!
269	Fatal this marriage, cancelling your fame,
270	Blotting your names from books of memory,
271	Razing the characters of your renown,
272	Defacing monuments of conquer'd France,
273	Undoing all, as all had never been!
274	
275	CARDINAL	Nephew, what means this passionate discourse,
276	This peroration with such circumstance?
277	For France, 'tis ours; and we will keep it still.
278	
279	GLOUCESTER	Ay, uncle, we will keep it, if we can;
280	But now it is impossible we should:
281	Suffolk, the new-made duke that rules the roast,
282	Hath given the duchy of Anjou and Maine
283	Unto the poor King Reignier, whose large style
284	Agrees not with the leanness of his purse.
285	
286	SALISBURY	Now, by the death of Him that died for all,
287	These counties were the keys of Normandy.
288	But wherefore weeps Warwick, my valiant son?
289	
290	WARWICK	For grief that they are past recovery:
291	For, were there hope to conquer them again,
292	My sword should shed hot blood, mine eyes no tears.
293	Anjou and Maine! myself did win them both;
294	Those provinces these arms of mine did conquer:
295	And are the cities, that I got with wounds,
296	Delivered up again with peaceful words?
297	Mort Dieu!
298	
299	YORK	For Suffolk's duke, may he be suffocate,
300	That dims the honour of this warlike isle!
301	France should have torn and rent my very heart,
302	Before I would have yielded to this league.
303	I never read but England's kings have had
304	Large sums of gold and dowries with their wives:
305	And our King Henry gives away his own,
306	To match with her that brings no vantages.
307	
308	GLOUCESTER	A proper jest, and never heard before,
309	That Suffolk should demand a whole fifteenth
310	For costs and charges in transporting her!
311	She should have stayed in France and starved
312	in France, Before--
313	
314	CARDINAL	My Lord of Gloucester, now ye grow too hot:
315	It was the pleasure of my lord the King.
316	
317	GLOUCESTER	My Lord of Winchester, I know your mind;
318	'Tis not my speeches that you do mislike,
319	But 'tis my presence that doth trouble ye.
320	Rancour will out: proud prelate, in thy face
321	I see thy fury: if I longer stay,
322	We shall begin our ancient bickerings.
323	Lordings, farewell; and say, when I am gone,
324	I prophesied France will be lost ere long.
325	
326	[Exit]
327	
328	CARDINAL	So, there goes our protector in a rage.
329	'Tis known to you he is mine enemy,
330	Nay, more, an enemy unto you all,
331	And no great friend, I fear me, to the king.
332	Consider, lords, he is the next of blood,
333	And heir apparent to the English crown:
334	Had Henry got an empire by his marriage,
335	And all the wealthy kingdoms of the west,
336	There's reason he should be displeased at it.
337	Look to it, lords! let not his smoothing words
338	Bewitch your hearts; be wise and circumspect.
339	What though the common people favour him,
340	Calling him 'Humphrey, the good Duke of
341	Gloucester,'
342	Clapping their hands, and crying with loud voice,
343	'Jesu maintain your royal excellence!'
344	With 'God preserve the good Duke Humphrey!'
345	I fear me, lords, for all this flattering gloss,
346	He will be found a dangerous protector.
347	
348	BUCKINGHAM	Why should he, then, protect our sovereign,
349	He being of age to govern of himself?
350	Cousin of Somerset, join you with me,
351	And all together, with the Duke of Suffolk,
352	We'll quickly hoise Duke Humphrey from his seat.
353	
354	CARDINAL	This weighty business will not brook delay:
355	I'll to the Duke of Suffolk presently.
356	
357	[Exit]
358	
359	SOMERSET	Cousin of Buckingham, though Humphrey's pride
360	And greatness of his place be grief to us,
361	Yet let us watch the haughty cardinal:
362	His insolence is more intolerable
363	Than all the princes in the land beside:
364	If Gloucester be displaced, he'll be protector.
365	
366	BUCKINGHAM	Or thou or I, Somerset, will be protector,
367	Despite Duke Humphrey or the cardinal.
368	
369	[Exeunt BUCKINGHAM and SOMERSET]
370	
371	SALISBURY	Pride went before, ambition follows him.
372	While these do labour for their own preferment,
373	Behoves it us to labour for the realm.
374	I never saw but Humphrey Duke of Gloucester
375	Did bear him like a noble gentleman.
376	Oft have I seen the haughty cardinal,
377	More like a soldier than a man o' the church,
378	As stout and proud as he were lord of all,
379	Swear like a ruffian and demean himself
380	Unlike the ruler of a commonweal.
381	Warwick, my son, the comfort of my age,
382	Thy deeds, thy plainness and thy housekeeping,
383	Hath won the greatest favour of the commons,
384	Excepting none but good Duke Humphrey:
385	And, brother York, thy acts in Ireland,
386	In bringing them to civil discipline,
387	Thy late exploits done in the heart of France,
388	When thou wert regent for our sovereign,
389	Have made thee fear'd and honour'd of the people:
390	Join we together, for the public good,
391	In what we can, to bridle and suppress
392	The pride of Suffolk and the cardinal,
393	With Somerset's and Buckingham's ambition;
394	And, as we may, cherish Duke Humphrey's deeds,
395	While they do tend the profit of the land.
396	
397	WARWICK	So God help Warwick, as he loves the land,
398	And common profit of his country!
399	
400	YORK	[Aside]  And so says York, for he hath greatest cause.
401	
402	SALISBURY	Then let's make haste away, and look unto the main.
403	
404	WARWICK	Unto the main! O father, Maine is lost;
405	That Maine which by main force Warwick did win,
406	And would have kept so long as breath did last!
407	Main chance, father, you meant; but I meant Maine,
408	Which I will win from France, or else be slain,
409	
410	[Exeunt WARWICK and SALISBURY]
411	
412	YORK	Anjou and Maine are given to the French;
413	Paris is lost; the state of Normandy
414	Stands on a tickle point, now they are gone:
415	Suffolk concluded on the articles,
416	The peers agreed, and Henry was well pleased
417	To change two dukedoms for a duke's fair daughter.
418	I cannot blame them all: what is't to them?
419	'Tis thine they give away, and not their own.
420	Pirates may make cheap pennyworths of their pillage
421	And purchase friends and give to courtezans,
422	Still revelling like lords till all be gone;
423	While as the silly owner of the goods
424	Weeps over them and wrings his hapless hands
425	And shakes his head and trembling stands aloof,
426	While all is shared and all is borne away,
427	Ready to starve and dare not touch his own:
428	So York must sit and fret and bite his tongue,
429	While his own lands are bargain'd for and sold.
430	Methinks the realms of England, France and Ireland
431	Bear that proportion to my flesh and blood
432	As did the fatal brand Althaea burn'd
433	Unto the prince's heart of Calydon.
434	Anjou and Maine both given unto the French!
435	Cold news for me, for I had hope of France,
436	Even as I have of fertile England's soil.
437	A day will come when York shall claim his own;
438	And therefore I will take the Nevils' parts
439	And make a show of love to proud Duke Humphrey,
440	And, when I spy advantage, claim the crown,
441	For that's the golden mark I seek to hit:
442	Nor shall proud Lancaster usurp my right,
443	Nor hold the sceptre in his childish fist,
444	Nor wear the diadem upon his head,
445	Whose church-like humours fits not for a crown.
446	Then, York, be still awhile, till time do serve:
447	Watch thou and wake when others be asleep,
448	To pry into the secrets of the state;
449	Till Henry, surfeiting in joys of love,
450	With his new bride and England's dear-bought queen,
451	And Humphrey with the peers be fall'n at jars:
452	Then will I raise aloft the milk-white rose,
453	With whose sweet smell the air shall be perfumed;
454	And in my standard bear the arms of York
455	To grapple with the house of Lancaster;
456	And, force perforce, I'll make him yield the crown,
457	Whose bookish rule hath pull'd fair England down.
458

467	ACT I

470	
471	SCENE II	GLOUCESTER'S house.
472	
473	
474	[Enter GLOUCESTER and his DUCHESS]
475	
476	DUCHESS	Why droops my lord, like over-ripen'd corn,
477	Hanging the head at Ceres' plenteous load?
478	Why doth the great Duke Humphrey knit his brows,
479	As frowning at the favours of the world?
480	Why are thine eyes fixed to the sullen earth,
481	Gazing on that which seems to dim thy sight?
482	What seest thou there? King Henry's diadem,
483	Enchased with all the honours of the world?
484	If so, gaze on, and grovel on thy face,
485	Until thy head be circled with the same.
486	Put forth thy hand, reach at the glorious gold.
487	What, is't too short? I'll lengthen it with mine:
488	And, having both together heaved it up,
489	We'll both together lift our heads to heaven,
490	And never more abase our sight so low
491	As to vouchsafe one glance unto the ground.
492	
493	GLOUCESTER	O Nell, sweet Nell, if thou dost love thy lord,
494	Banish the canker of ambitious thoughts.
495	And may that thought, when I imagine ill
496	Against my king and nephew, virtuous Henry,
497	Be my last breathing in this mortal world!
498	My troublous dream this night doth make me sad.
499	
500	DUCHESS	What dream'd my lord? tell me, and I'll requite it
501	With sweet rehearsal of my morning's dream.
502	
503	GLOUCESTER	Methought this staff, mine office-badge in court,
504	Was broke in twain; by whom I have forgot,
505	But, as I think, it was by the cardinal;
506	And on the pieces of the broken wand
507	Were placed the heads of Edmund Duke of Somerset,
508	And William de la Pole, first duke of Suffolk.
509	This was my dream: what it doth bode, God knows.
510	
511	DUCHESS	Tut, this was nothing but an argument
512	That he that breaks a stick of Gloucester's grove
513	Shall lose his head for his presumption.
514	But list to me, my Humphrey, my sweet duke:
515	Methought I sat in seat of majesty
516	In the cathedral church of Westminster,
517	And in that chair where kings and queens are crown'd;
518	Where Henry and dame Margaret kneel'd to me
519	And on my head did set the diadem.
520	
521	GLOUCESTER	Nay, Eleanor, then must I chide outright:
522	Presumptuous dame, ill-nurtured Eleanor,
523	Art thou not second woman in the realm,
524	And the protector's wife, beloved of him?
525	Hast thou not worldly pleasure at command,
526	Above the reach or compass of thy thought?
527	And wilt thou still be hammering treachery,
528	To tumble down thy husband and thyself
529	From top of honour to disgrace's feet?
530	Away from me, and let me hear no more!
531	
532	DUCHESS	What, what, my lord! are you so choleric
533	With Eleanor, for telling but her dream?
534	Next time I'll keep my dreams unto myself,
535	And not be cheque'd.
536	
537	GLOUCESTER	Nay, be not angry; I am pleased again.
538	
539	[Enter Messenger]
540	
541	Messenger	My lord protector, 'tis his highness' pleasure
542	You do prepare to ride unto Saint Alban's,
543	Where as the king and queen do mean to hawk.
544	
545	GLOUCESTER	I go. Come, Nell, thou wilt ride with us?
546	
547	DUCHESS	Yes, my good lord, I'll follow presently.
548	
549	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Messenger]
550	
551	Follow I must; I cannot go before,
552	While Gloucester bears this base and humble mind.
553	Were I a man, a duke, and next of blood,
554	I would remove these tedious stumbling-blocks
555	And smooth my way upon their headless necks;
556	And, being a woman, I will not be slack
557	To play my part in Fortune's pageant.
558	Where are you there? Sir John! nay, fear not, man,
559	We are alone; here's none but thee and I.
560	
561	[Enter HUME]
562	
563	HUME	Jesus preserve your royal majesty!
564	
565	DUCHESS	What say'st thou? majesty! I am but grace.
566	
567	HUME	But, by the grace of God, and Hume's advice,
568	Your grace's title shall be multiplied.
569	
570	DUCHESS	What say'st thou, man? hast thou as yet conferr'd
571	With Margery Jourdain, the cunning witch,
572	With Roger Bolingbroke, the conjurer?
573	And will they undertake to do me good?
574	
575	HUME	This they have promised, to show your highness
576	A spirit raised from depth of under-ground,
577	That shall make answer to such questions
578	As by your grace shall be propounded him.
579	
580	DUCHESS	It is enough; I'll think upon the questions:
581	When from St. Alban's we do make return,
582	We'll see these things effected to the full.
583	Here, Hume, take this reward; make merry, man,
584	With thy confederates in this weighty cause.
585	
586	[Exit]
587	
588	HUME	Hume must make merry with the duchess' gold;
589	Marry, and shall. But how now, Sir John Hume!
590	Seal up your lips, and give no words but mum:
591	The business asketh silent secrecy.
592	Dame Eleanor gives gold to bring the witch:
593	Gold cannot come amiss, were she a devil.
594	Yet have I gold flies from another coast;
595	I dare not say, from the rich cardinal
596	And from the great and new-made Duke of Suffolk,
597	Yet I do find it so; for to be plain,
598	They, knowing Dame Eleanor's aspiring humour,
599	Have hired me to undermine the duchess
600	And buz these conjurations in her brain.
601	They say 'A crafty knave does need no broker;'
602	Yet am I Suffolk and the cardinal's broker.
603	Hume, if you take not heed, you shall go near
604	To call them both a pair of crafty knaves.
605	Well, so it stands; and thus, I fear, at last
606	Hume's knavery will be the duchess' wreck,
607	And her attainture will be Humphrey's fall:
608	Sort how it will, I shall have gold for all.
609

615	2 KING HENRY VI
616	
617	
618	ACT I
619	
620	
621	
622	SCENE III	The palace.
623	
624	
625	[Enter three or four Petitioners, PETER, the
626	Armourer's man, being one]
627	
628	First Petitioner	My masters, let's stand close: my lord protector
629	will come this way by and by, and then we may deliver
630	our supplications in the quill.
631	
632	Second Petitioner	Marry, the Lord protect him, for he's a good man!
633	Jesu bless him!
634	
635	[Enter SUFFOLK and QUEEN MARGARET]
636	
637	PETER	Here a' comes, methinks, and the queen with him.
638	I'll be the first, sure.
639	
640	Second Petitioner	Come back, fool; this is the Duke of Suffolk, and
641	not my lord protector.
642	
643	SUFFOLK	How now, fellow! would'st anything with me?
644	
645	First Petitioner	I pray, my lord, pardon me; I took ye for my lord
646	protector.
647	
648	QUEEN MARGARET	[Reading]  'To my Lord Protector!' Are your
649	supplications to his lordship? Let me see them:
650	what is thine?
651	
652	First Petitioner	Mine is, an't please your grace, against John
653	Goodman, my lord cardinal's man, for keeping my
654	house, and lands, and wife and all, from me.
655	
656	SUFFOLK	Thy wife, too! that's some wrong, indeed. What's
657	yours? What's here!
658	
659	[Reads]
660	
661	'Against the Duke of Suffolk, for enclosing the
662	commons of Melford.' How now, sir knave!
663	
664	Second Petitioner	Alas, sir, I am but a poor petitioner of our whole township.
665	
666	PETER	[Giving his petition]  Against my master, Thomas
667	Horner, for saying that the Duke of York was rightful
668	heir to the crown.
669	
670	QUEEN MARGARET	What sayst thou? did the Duke of York say he was
671	rightful heir to the crown?
672	
673	PETER	That my master was? no, forsooth: my master said
674	that he was, and that the king was an usurper.
675	
676	SUFFOLK	Who is there?
677	
678	[Enter Servant]
679	
680	Take this fellow in, and send for
681	his master with a pursuivant presently: we'll hear
682	more of your matter before the King.
683	
684	[Exit Servant with PETER]
685	
686	QUEEN MARGARET	And as for you, that love to be protected
687	Under the wings of our protector's grace,
688	Begin your suits anew, and sue to him.
689	
690	[Tears the supplication]
691	
692	Away, base cullions! Suffolk, let them go.
693	
694	ALL	Come, let's be gone.
695	
696	[Exeunt]
697	
698	QUEEN MARGARET	My Lord of Suffolk, say, is this the guise,
699	Is this the fashion in the court of England?
700	Is this the government of Britain's isle,
701	And this the royalty of Albion's king?
702	What shall King Henry be a pupil still
703	Under the surly Gloucester's governance?
704	Am I a queen in title and in style,
705	And must be made a subject to a duke?
706	I tell thee, Pole, when in the city Tours
707	Thou ran'st a tilt in honour of my love
708	And stolest away the ladies' hearts of France,
709	I thought King Henry had resembled thee
710	In courage, courtship and proportion:
711	But all his mind is bent to holiness,
712	To number Ave-Maries on his beads;
713	His champions are the prophets and apostles,
714	His weapons holy saws of sacred writ,
715	His study is his tilt-yard, and his loves
716	Are brazen images of canonized saints.
717	I would the college of the cardinals
718	Would choose him pope, and carry him to Rome,
719	And set the triple crown upon his head:
720	That were a state fit for his holiness.
721	
722	SUFFOLK	Madam, be patient: as I was cause
723	Your highness came to England, so will I
724	In England work your grace's full content.
725	
726	QUEEN MARGARET	Beside the haughty protector, have we Beaufort,
727	The imperious churchman, Somerset, Buckingham,
728	And grumbling York: and not the least of these
729	But can do more in England than the king.
730	
731	SUFFOLK	And he of these that can do most of all
732	Cannot do more in England than the Nevils:
733	Salisbury and Warwick are no simple peers.
734	
735	QUEEN MARGARET	Not all these lords do vex me half so much
736	As that proud dame, the lord protector's wife.
737	She sweeps it through the court with troops of ladies,
738	More like an empress than Duke Humphrey's wife:
739	Strangers in court do take her for the queen:
740	She bears a duke's revenues on her back,
741	And in her heart she scorns our poverty:
742	Shall I not live to be avenged on her?
743	Contemptuous base-born callet as she is,
744	She vaunted 'mongst her minions t'other day,
745	The very train of her worst wearing gown
746	Was better worth than all my father's lands,
747	Till Suffolk gave two dukedoms for his daughter.
748	
749	SUFFOLK	Madam, myself have limed a bush for her,
750	And placed a quire of such enticing birds,
751	That she will light to listen to the lays,
752	And never mount to trouble you again.
753	So, let her rest: and, madam, list to me;
754	For I am bold to counsel you in this.
755	Although we fancy not the cardinal,
756	Yet must we join with him and with the lords,
757	Till we have brought Duke Humphrey in disgrace.
758	As for the Duke of York, this late complaint
759	Will make but little for his benefit.
760	So, one by one, we'll weed them all at last,
761	And you yourself shall steer the happy helm.
762	
763	[Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, GLOUCESTER,
764	CARDINAL, BUCKINGHAM, YORK, SOMERSET, SALISBURY,
765	WARWICK, and the DUCHESS]
766	
767	KING HENRY VI	For my part, noble lords, I care not which;
768	Or Somerset or York, all's one to me.
769	
770	YORK	If York have ill demean'd himself in France,
771	Then let him be denay'd the regentship.
772	
773	SOMERSET	If Somerset be unworthy of the place,
774	Let York be regent; I will yield to him.
775	
776	WARWICK	Whether your grace be worthy, yea or no,
777	Dispute not that: York is the worthier.
778	
779	CARDINAL	Ambitious Warwick, let thy betters speak.
780	
781	WARWICK	The cardinal's not my better in the field.
782	
783	BUCKINGHAM	All in this presence are thy betters, Warwick.
784	
785	WARWICK	Warwick may live to be the best of all.
786	
787	SALISBURY	Peace, son! and show some reason, Buckingham,
788	Why Somerset should be preferred in this.
789	
790	QUEEN MARGARET	Because the king, forsooth, will have it so.
791	
792	GLOUCESTER	Madam, the king is old enough himself
793	To give his censure: these are no women's matters.
794	
795	QUEEN MARGARET	If he be old enough, what needs your grace
796	To be protector of his excellence?
797	
798	GLOUCESTER	Madam, I am protector of the realm;
799	And, at his pleasure, will resign my place.
800	
801	SUFFOLK	Resign it then and leave thine insolence.
802	Since thou wert king--as who is king but thou?--
803	The commonwealth hath daily run to wreck;
804	The Dauphin hath prevail'd beyond the seas;
805	And all the peers and nobles of the realm
806	Have been as bondmen to thy sovereignty.
807	
808	CARDINAL	The commons hast thou rack'd; the clergy's bags
809	Are lank and lean with thy extortions.
810	
811	SOMERSET	Thy sumptuous buildings and thy wife's attire
812	Have cost a mass of public treasury.
813	
814	BUCKINGHAM	Thy cruelty in execution
815	Upon offenders, hath exceeded law,
816	And left thee to the mercy of the law.
817	
818	QUEEN MARGARET	They sale of offices and towns in France,
819	If they were known, as the suspect is great,
820	Would make thee quickly hop without thy head.
821	
822	[Exit GLOUCESTER. QUEEN MARGARET drops her fan]
823	
824	Give me my fan: what, minion! can ye not?
825	
826	[She gives the DUCHESS a box on the ear]
827	
828	I cry you mercy, madam; was it you?
829	
830	DUCHESS	Was't I! yea, I it was, proud Frenchwoman:
831	Could I come near your beauty with my nails,
832	I'd set my ten commandments in your face.
833	
834	KING HENRY VI	Sweet aunt, be quiet; 'twas against her will.
835	
836	DUCHESS	Against her will! good king, look to't in time;
837	She'll hamper thee, and dandle thee like a baby:
838	Though in this place most master wear no breeches,
839	She shall not strike Dame Eleanor unrevenged.
840	
841	[Exit]
842	
843	BUCKINGHAM	Lord cardinal, I will follow Eleanor,
844	And listen after Humphrey, how he proceeds:
845	She's tickled now; her fume needs no spurs,
846	She'll gallop far enough to her destruction.
847	
848	[Exit]
849	
850	[Re-enter GLOUCESTER]
851	
852	GLOUCESTER	Now, lords, my choler being over-blown
853	With walking once about the quadrangle,
854	I come to talk of commonwealth affairs.
855	As for your spiteful false objections,
856	Prove them, and I lie open to the law:
857	But God in mercy so deal with my soul,
858	As I in duty love my king and country!
859	But, to the matter that we have in hand:
860	I say, my sovereign, York is meetest man
861	To be your regent in the realm of France.
862	
863	SUFFOLK	Before we make election, give me leave
864	To show some reason, of no little force,
865	That York is most unmeet of any man.
866	
867	YORK	I'll tell thee, Suffolk, why I am unmeet:
868	First, for I cannot flatter thee in pride;
869	Next, if I be appointed for the place,
870	My Lord of Somerset will keep me here,
871	Without discharge, money, or furniture,
872	Till France be won into the Dauphin's hands:
873	Last time, I danced attendance on his will
874	Till Paris was besieged, famish'd, and lost.
875	
876	WARWICK	That can I witness; and a fouler fact
877	Did never traitor in the land commit.
878	
879	SUFFOLK	Peace, headstrong Warwick!
880	
881	WARWICK	Image of pride, why should I hold my peace?
882	
883	[Enter HORNER, the Armourer, and his man
884	PETER, guarded]
885	
886	SUFFOLK	Because here is a man accused of treason:
887	Pray God the Duke of York excuse himself!
888	
889	YORK	Doth any one accuse York for a traitor?
890	
891	KING HENRY VI	What mean'st thou, Suffolk; tell me, what are these?
892	
893	SUFFOLK	Please it your majesty, this is the man
894	That doth accuse his master of high treason:
895	His words were these: that Richard, Duke of York,
896	Was rightful heir unto the English crown
897	And that your majesty was a usurper.
898	
899	KING HENRY VI	Say, man, were these thy words?
900	
901	HORNER	An't shall please your majesty, I never said nor
902	thought any such matter: God is my witness, I am
903	falsely accused by the villain.
904	
905	PETER	By these ten bones, my lords, he did speak them to
906	me in the garret one night, as we were scouring my
907	Lord of York's armour.
908	
909	YORK	Base dunghill villain and mechanical,
910	I'll have thy head for this thy traitor's speech.
911	I do beseech your royal majesty,
912	Let him have all the rigor of the law.
913	
914	HORNER	Alas, my lord, hang me, if ever I spake the words.
915	My accuser is my 'prentice; and when I did correct
916	him for his fault the other day, he did vow upon his
917	knees he would be even with me: I have good
918	witness of this: therefore I beseech your majesty,
919	do not cast away an honest man for a villain's
920	accusation.
921	
922	KING HENRY VI	Uncle, what shall we say to this in law?
923	
924	GLOUCESTER	This doom, my lord, if I may judge:
925	Let Somerset be regent over the French,
926	Because in York this breeds suspicion:
927	And let these have a day appointed them
928	For single combat in convenient place,
929	For he hath witness of his servant's malice:
930	This is the law, and this Duke Humphrey's doom.
931	
932	SOMERSET	I humbly thank your royal majesty.
933	
934	HORNER	And I accept the combat willingly.
935	
936	PETER	Alas, my lord, I cannot fight; for God's sake, pity
937	my case. The spite of man prevaileth against me. O
938	Lord, have mercy upon me! I shall never be able to
939	fight a blow. O Lord, my heart!
940	
941	GLOUCESTER	Sirrah, or you must fight, or else be hang'd.
942	
943	KING HENRY VI	Away with them to prison; and the day of combat
944	shall be the last of the next month. Come,
945	Somerset, we'll see thee sent away.

960	
961	
962	[Enter MARGARET JOURDAIN, HUME, SOUTHWELL, and
963	BOLINGBROKE]
964	
965	HUME	Come, my masters; the duchess, I tell you, expects
966	performance of your promises.
967	
968	BOLINGBROKE	Master Hume, we are therefore provided: will her
969	ladyship behold and hear our exorcisms?
970	
971	HUME	Ay, what else? fear you not her courage.
972	
973	BOLINGBROKE	I have heard her reported to be a woman of an
974	invincible spirit: but it shall be convenient,
975	Master Hume, that you be by her aloft, while we be
976	busy below; and so, I pray you, go, in God's name,
977	and leave us.
978	
979	[Exit HUME]
980	
981	Mother Jourdain, be you
982	prostrate and grovel on the earth; John Southwell,
983	read you; and let us to our work.
984	
985	[Enter the DUCHESS aloft, HUME following]
986	
987	DUCHESS	Well said, my masters; and welcome all. To this
988	gear the sooner the better.
989	
990	BOLINGBROKE	Patience, good lady; wizards know their times:
991	Deep night, dark night, the silent of the night,
992	The time of night when Troy was set on fire;
993	The time when screech-owls cry and ban-dogs howl,
994	And spirits walk and ghosts break up their graves,
995	That time best fits the work we have in hand.
996	Madam, sit you and fear not: whom we raise,
997	We will make fast within a hallow'd verge.
998	
999	[Here they do the ceremonies belonging, and make the
1000	circle; BOLINGBROKE or SOUTHWELL reads, Conjuro te,

1002	Spirit riseth]
1003	
1004	Spirit	Adsum.
1005	
1006	MARGARET JOURDAIN	Asmath,
1007	By the eternal God, whose name and power
1008	Thou tremblest at, answer that I shall ask;
1009	For, till thou speak, thou shalt not pass from hence.
1010	
1011	Spirit	Ask what thou wilt. That I had said and done!
1012	
1013	BOLINGBROKE	'First of the king: what shall of him become?'
1014	
1015	[Reading out of a paper]
1016	
1017	Spirit	The duke yet lives that Henry shall depose;
1018	But him outlive, and die a violent death.
1019	
1020	[As the Spirit speaks, SOUTHWELL writes the answer]
1021	
1022	BOLINGBROKE	'What fates await the Duke of Suffolk?'
1023	
1024	Spirit	By water shall he die, and take his end.
1025	
1026	BOLINGBROKE	'What shall befall the Duke of Somerset?'
1027	
1028	Spirit	Let him shun castles;
1029	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
1030	Than where castles mounted stand.
1031	Have done, for more I hardly can endure.
1032	
1033	BOLINGBROKE	Descend to darkness and the burning lake!
1034	False fiend, avoid!
1035	
1036	[Thunder and lightning. Exit Spirit]

1039	and break in]
1040	
1041	YORK	Lay hands upon these traitors and their trash.
1042	Beldam, I think we watch'd you at an inch.
1043	What, madam, are you there? the king and commonweal
1044	Are deeply indebted for this piece of pains:
1045	My lord protector will, I doubt it not,
1046	See you well guerdon'd for these good deserts.
1047	
1048	DUCHESS	Not half so bad as thine to England's king,
1049	Injurious duke, that threatest where's no cause.
1050	
1051	BUCKINGHAM	True, madam, none at all: what call you this?
1052	Away with them! let them be clapp'd up close.
1053	And kept asunder. You, madam, shall with us.
1054	Stafford, take her to thee.
1055	
1056	[Exeunt above DUCHESS and HUME, guarded]
1057	
1058	We'll see your trinkets here all forthcoming.
1059	All, away!
1060	
1061	[Exeunt guard with MARGARET JOURDAIN, SOUTHWELL, &c]
1062	
1063	YORK	Lord Buckingham, methinks, you watch'd her well:
1064	A pretty plot, well chosen to build upon!
1065	Now, pray, my lord, let's see the devil's writ.
1066	What have we here?
1067	
1068	[Reads]
1069	
1070	'The duke yet lives, that Henry shall depose;
1071	But him outlive, and die a violent death.'
1072	Why, this is just
1073	'Aio te, AEacida, Romanos vincere posse.'
1074	Well, to the rest:
1075	'Tell me what fate awaits the Duke of Suffolk?
1076	By water shall he die, and take his end.
1077	What shall betide the Duke of Somerset?
1078	Let him shun castles;
1079	Safer shall he be upon the sandy plains
1080	Than where castles mounted stand.'
1081	Come, come, my lords;
1082	These oracles are hardly attain'd,
1083	And hardly understood.
1084	The king is now in progress towards Saint Alban's,
1085	With him the husband of this lovely lady:
1086	Thither go these news, as fast as horse can
1087	carry them:
1088	A sorry breakfast for my lord protector.
1089	
1090	BUCKINGHAM	Your grace shall give me leave, my Lord of York,
1091	To be the post, in hope of his reward.

1118	
1119	QUEEN MARGARET	Believe me, lords, for flying at the brook,
1120	I saw not better sport these seven years' day:
1121	Yet, by your leave, the wind was very high;
1122	And, ten to one, old Joan had not gone out.

1124	KING HENRY VI	But what a point, my lord, your falcon made,
1125	And what a pitch she flew above the rest!
1126	To see how God in all his creatures works!
1127	Yea, man and birds are fain of climbing high.
1128	
1129	SUFFOLK	No marvel, an it like your majesty,
1130	My lord protector's hawks do tower so well;
1131	They know their master loves to be aloft,
1132	And bears his thoughts above his falcon's pitch.
1133	
1134	GLOUCESTER	My lord, 'tis but a base ignoble mind
1135	That mounts no higher than a bird can soar.
1136	
1137	CARDINAL	I thought as much; he would be above the clouds.
1138	
1139	GLOUCESTER	Ay, my lord cardinal? how think you by that?
1140	Were it not good your grace could fly to heaven?
1141	
1142	KING HENRY VI	The treasury of everlasting joy.
1143	
1144	CARDINAL	Thy heaven is on earth; thine eyes and thoughts
1145	Beat on a crown, the treasure of thy heart;
1146	Pernicious protector, dangerous peer,
1147	That smooth'st it so with king and commonweal!
1148	
1149	GLOUCESTER	What, cardinal, is your priesthood grown peremptory?
1150	Tantaene animis coelestibus irae?
1151	Churchmen so hot? good uncle, hide such malice;
1152	With such holiness can you do it?
1153	
1154	SUFFOLK	No malice, sir; no more than well becomes
1155	So good a quarrel and so bad a peer.
1156	
1157	GLOUCESTER	As who, my lord?
1158	
1159	SUFFOLK	       Why, as you, my lord,
1160	An't like your lordly lord-protectorship.
1161	
1162	GLOUCESTER	Why, Suffolk, England knows thine insolence.
1163	
1164	QUEEN MARGARET	And thy ambition, Gloucester.
1165	
1166	KING HENRY VI	I prithee, peace, good queen,
1167	And whet not on these furious peers;
1168	For blessed are the peacemakers on earth.
1169	
1170	CARDINAL	Let me be blessed for the peace I make,
1171	Against this proud protector, with my sword!
1172	
1173	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL]  Faith, holy uncle, would
1174	'twere come to that!
1175	
1176	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Marry, when thou darest.
1177	
1178	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL]  Make up no factious
1179	numbers for the matter;
1180	In thine own person answer thy abuse.
1181	
1182	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Ay, where thou darest
1183	not peep: an if thou darest,
1184	This evening, on the east side of the grove.
1185	
1186	KING HENRY VI	How now, my lords!
1187	
1188	CARDINAL	       Believe me, cousin Gloucester,
1189	Had not your man put up the fowl so suddenly,
1190	We had had more sport.
1191	
1192	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]
1193	
1194	Come with thy two-hand sword.
1195	
1196	GLOUCESTER	True, uncle.
1197	
1198	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Are ye advised? the
1199	east side of the grove?
1200	
1201	GLOUCESTER	[Aside to CARDINAL]  Cardinal, I am with you.
1202	
1203	KING HENRY VI	Why, how now, uncle Gloucester!
1204	
1205	GLOUCESTER	Talking of hawking; nothing else, my lord.
1206	
1207	[Aside to CARDINAL]
1208	
1209	Now, by God's mother, priest, I'll shave your crown for this,
1210	Or all my fence shall fail.
1211	
1212	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  Medice, teipsum--
1213	Protector, see to't well, protect yourself.
1214	
1215	KING HENRY VI	The winds grow high; so do your stomachs, lords.
1216	How irksome is this music to my heart!
1217	When such strings jar, what hope of harmony?
1218	I pray, my lords, let me compound this strife.
1219	
1220	[Enter a Townsman of Saint Alban's, crying 'A miracle!']
1221	
1222	GLOUCESTER	What means this noise?
1223	Fellow, what miracle dost thou proclaim?
1224	
1225	Townsman	A miracle! a miracle!
1226	
1227	SUFFOLK	Come to the king and tell him what miracle.
1228	
1229	Townsman	Forsooth, a blind man at Saint Alban's shrine,
1230	Within this half-hour, hath received his sight;
1231	A man that ne'er saw in his life before.
1232	
1233	KING HENRY VI	Now, God be praised, that to believing souls
1234	Gives light in darkness, comfort in despair!
1235	
1236	[Enter the Mayor of Saint Alban's and his
1237	brethren, bearing SIMPCOX, between two in a
1238	chair, SIMPCOX's Wife following]
1239	
1240	CARDINAL	Here comes the townsmen on procession,
1241	To present your highness with the man.
1242	
1243	KING HENRY VI	Great is his comfort in this earthly vale,
1244	Although by his sight his sin be multiplied.
1245	
1246	GLOUCESTER	Stand by, my masters: bring him near the king;
1247	His highness' pleasure is to talk with him.
1248	
1249	KING HENRY VI	Good fellow, tell us here the circumstance,
1250	That we for thee may glorify the Lord.
1251	What, hast thou been long blind and now restored?
1252	
1253	SIMPCOX	Born blind, an't please your grace.
1254	
1255	Wife	Ay, indeed, was he.
1256	
1257	SUFFOLK	What woman is this?
1258	
1259	Wife	His wife, an't like your worship.
1260	
1261	GLOUCESTER	Hadst thou been his mother, thou couldst have
1262	better told.
1263	
1264	KING HENRY VI	Where wert thou born?
1265	
1266	SIMPCOX	At Berwick in the north, an't like your grace.
1267	
1268	KING HENRY VI	Poor soul, God's goodness hath been great to thee:
1269	Let never day nor night unhallow'd pass,
1270	But still remember what the Lord hath done.
1271	
1272	QUEEN MARGARET	Tell me, good fellow, camest thou here by chance,
1273	Or of devotion, to this holy shrine?
1274	
1275	SIMPCOX	God knows, of pure devotion; being call'd
1276	A hundred times and oftener, in my sleep,
1277	By good Saint Alban; who said, 'Simpcox, come,
1278	Come, offer at my shrine, and I will help thee.'
1279	
1280	Wife	Most true, forsooth; and many time and oft
1281	Myself have heard a voice to call him so.
1282	
1283	CARDINAL	What, art thou lame?
1284	
1285	SIMPCOX	Ay, God Almighty help me!
1286	
1287	SUFFOLK	How camest thou so?
1288	
1289	SIMPCOX	A fall off of a tree.
1290	
1291	Wife	A plum-tree, master.
1292	
1293	GLOUCESTER	How long hast thou been blind?
1294	
1295	SIMPCOX	Born so, master.
1296	
1297	GLOUCESTER	       What, and wouldst climb a tree?
1298	
1299	SIMPCOX	But that in all my life, when I was a youth.
1300	
1301	Wife	Too true; and bought his climbing very dear.
1302	
1303	GLOUCESTER	Mass, thou lovedst plums well, that wouldst
1304	venture so.
1305	
1306	SIMPCOX	Alas, good master, my wife desired some damsons,
1307	And made me climb, with danger of my life.
1308	
1309	GLOUCESTER	A subtle knave! but yet it shall not serve.
1310	Let me see thine eyes: wink now: now open them:
1311	In my opinion yet thou seest not well.
1312	
1313	SIMPCOX	Yes, master, clear as day, I thank God and
1314	Saint Alban.
1315	
1316	GLOUCESTER	Say'st thou me so? What colour is this cloak of?
1317	
1318	SIMPCOX	Red, master; red as blood.
1319	
1320	GLOUCESTER	Why, that's well said. What colour is my gown of?
1321	
1322	SIMPCOX	Black, forsooth: coal-black as jet.
1323	
1324	KING HENRY VI	Why, then, thou know'st what colour jet is of?
1325	
1326	SUFFOLK	And yet, I think, jet did he never see.
1327	
1328	GLOUCESTER	But cloaks and gowns, before this day, a many.
1329	
1330	Wife	Never, before this day, in all his life.
1331	
1332	GLOUCESTER	Tell me, sirrah, what's my name?
1333	
1334	SIMPCOX	Alas, master, I know not.
1335	
1336	GLOUCESTER	What's his name?
1337	
1338	SIMPCOX	I know not.
1339	
1340	GLOUCESTER	Nor his?
1341	
1342	SIMPCOX	No, indeed, master.
1343	
1344	GLOUCESTER	What's thine own name?
1345	
1346	SIMPCOX	Saunder Simpcox, an if it please you, master.
1347	
1348	GLOUCESTER	Then, Saunder, sit there, the lyingest knave in
1349	Christendom. If thou hadst been born blind, thou
1350	mightest as well have known all our names as thus to
1351	name the several colours we do wear. Sight may
1352	distinguish of colours, but suddenly to nominate them
1353	all, it is impossible. My lords, Saint Alban here
1354	hath done a miracle; and would ye not think his
1355	cunning to be great, that could restore this cripple
1356	to his legs again?
1357	
1358	SIMPCOX	O master, that you could!
1359	
1360	GLOUCESTER	My masters of Saint Alban's, have you not beadles in
1361	your town, and things called whips?
1362	
1363	Mayor	Yes, my lord, if it please your grace.
1364	
1365	GLOUCESTER	Then send for one presently.
1366	
1367	Mayor	Sirrah, go fetch the beadle hither straight.
1368	
1369	[Exit an Attendant]
1370	
1371	GLOUCESTER	Now fetch me a stool hither by and by. Now, sirrah,
1372	if you mean to save yourself from whipping, leap me
1373	over this stool and run away.
1374	
1375	SIMPCOX	Alas, master, I am not able to stand alone:
1376	You go about to torture me in vain.
1377	
1378	[Enter a Beadle with whips]
1379	
1380	GLOUCESTER	Well, sir, we must have you find your legs. Sirrah
1381	beadle, whip him till he leap over that same stool.
1382	
1383	Beadle	I will, my lord. Come on, sirrah; off with your
1384	doublet quickly.
1385	
1386	SIMPCOX	Alas, master, what shall I do? I am not able to stand.
1387	
1388	[After the Beadle hath hit him once, he leaps over
1389	the stool and runs away; and they follow and cry, 'A miracle!']
1390	
1391	KING HENRY VI	O God, seest Thou this, and bearest so long?
1392	
1393	QUEEN MARGARET	It made me laugh to see the villain run.
1394	
1395	GLOUCESTER	Follow the knave; and take this drab away.
1396	
1397	Wife	Alas, sir, we did it for pure need.
1398	
1399	GLOUCESTER	Let them be whipped through every market-town, till
1400	they come to Berwick, from whence they came.
1401	
1402	[Exeunt Wife, Beadle, Mayor, &c]
1403	
1404	CARDINAL	Duke Humphrey has done a miracle to-day.
1405	
1406	SUFFOLK	True; made the lame to leap and fly away.
1407	
1408	GLOUCESTER	But you have done more miracles than I;
1409	You made in a day, my lord, whole towns to fly.
1410	
1411	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]
1412	
1413	KING HENRY VI	What tidings with our cousin Buckingham?
1414	
1415	BUCKINGHAM	Such as my heart doth tremble to unfold.
1416	A sort of naughty persons, lewdly bent,
1417	Under the countenance and confederacy
1418	Of Lady Eleanor, the protector's wife,
1419	The ringleader and head of all this rout,
1420	Have practised dangerously against your state,
1421	Dealing with witches and with conjurers:
1422	Whom we have apprehended in the fact;
1423	Raising up wicked spirits from under ground,
1424	Demanding of King Henry's life and death,
1425	And other of your highness' privy-council;
1426	As more at large your grace shall understand.
1427	
1428	CARDINAL	[Aside to GLOUCESTER]  And so, my lord protector,
1429	by this means
1430	Your lady is forthcoming yet at London.
1431	This news, I think, hath turn'd your weapon's edge;
1432	'Tis like, my lord, you will not keep your hour.
1433	
1434	GLOUCESTER	Ambitious churchman, leave to afflict my heart:
1435	Sorrow and grief have vanquish'd all my powers;
1436	And, vanquish'd as I am, I yield to thee,
1437	Or to the meanest groom.
1438	
1439	KING HENRY VI	O God, what mischiefs work the wicked ones,
1440	Heaping confusion on their own heads thereby!
1441	
1442	QUEEN MARGARET	Gloucester, see here the tainture of thy nest.
1443	And look thyself be faultless, thou wert best.
1444	
1445	GLOUCESTER	Madam, for myself, to heaven I do appeal,
1446	How I have loved my king and commonweal:
1447	And, for my wife, I know not how it stands;
1448	Sorry I am to hear what I have heard:
1449	Noble she is, but if she have forgot
1450	Honour and virtue and conversed with such
1451	As, like to pitch, defile nobility,
1452	I banish her my bed and company
1453	And give her as a prey to law and shame,
1454	That hath dishonour'd Gloucester's honest name.
1455	
1456	KING HENRY VI	Well, for this night we will repose us here:
1457	To-morrow toward London back again,
1458	To look into this business thoroughly
1459	And call these foul offenders to their answers
1460	And poise the cause in justice' equal scales,
1461	Whose beam stands sure, whose rightful cause prevails.

1473	
1474	
1475	SCENE II	London. YORK'S garden.
1476	
1477	
1478	[Enter YORK, SALISBURY, and WARWICK]
1479	
1480	YORK	Now, my good Lords of Salisbury and Warwick,
1481	Our simple supper ended, give me leave
1482	In this close walk to satisfy myself,
1483	In craving your opinion of my title,
1484	Which is infallible, to England's crown.
1485	
1486	SALISBURY	My lord, I long to hear it at full.
1487	
1488	WARWICK	Sweet York, begin: and if thy claim be good,
1489	The Nevils are thy subjects to command.
1490	
1491	YORK	Then thus:
1492	Edward the Third, my lords, had seven sons:
1493	The first, Edward the Black Prince, Prince of Wales;
1494	The second, William of Hatfield, and the third,
1495	Lionel Duke of Clarence: next to whom
1496	Was John of Gaunt, the Duke of Lancaster;
1497	The fifth was Edmund Langley, Duke of York;
1498	The sixth was Thomas of Woodstock, Duke of Gloucester;
1499	William of Windsor was the seventh and last.
1500	Edward the Black Prince died before his father
1501	And left behind him Richard, his only son,
1502	Who after Edward the Third's death reign'd as king;
1503	Till Henry Bolingbroke, Duke of Lancaster,
1504	The eldest son and heir of John of Gaunt,
1505	Crown'd by the name of Henry the Fourth,
1506	Seized on the realm, deposed the rightful king,
1507	Sent his poor queen to France, from whence she came,
1508	And him to Pomfret; where, as all you know,
1509	Harmless Richard was murder'd traitorously.
1510	
1511	WARWICK	Father, the duke hath told the truth:
1512	Thus got the house of Lancaster the crown.
1513	
1514	YORK	Which now they hold by force and not by right;
1515	For Richard, the first son's heir, being dead,
1516	The issue of the next son should have reign'd.
1517	
1518	SALISBURY	But William of Hatfield died without an heir.
1519	
1520	YORK	The third son, Duke of Clarence, from whose line
1521	I claimed the crown, had issue, Philippe, a daughter,
1522	Who married Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March:
1523	Edmund had issue, Roger Earl of March;
1524	Roger had issue, Edmund, Anne and Eleanor.
1525	
1526	SALISBURY	This Edmund, in the reign of Bolingbroke,
1527	As I have read, laid claim unto the crown;
1528	And, but for Owen Glendower, had been king,
1529	Who kept him in captivity till he died.
1530	But to the rest.
1531	
1532	YORK	       His eldest sister, Anne,
1533	My mother, being heir unto the crown
1534	Married Richard Earl of Cambridge; who was son
1535	To Edmund Langley, Edward the Third's fifth son.
1536	By her I claim the kingdom: she was heir
1537	To Roger Earl of March, who was the son
1538	Of Edmund Mortimer, who married Philippe,
1539	Sole daughter unto Lionel Duke of Clarence:
1540	So, if the issue of the elder son
1541	Succeed before the younger, I am king.
1542	
1543	WARWICK	What plain proceeding is more plain than this?
1544	Henry doth claim the crown from John of Gaunt,
1545	The fourth son; York claims it from the third.
1546	Till Lionel's issue fails, his should not reign:
1547	It fails not yet, but flourishes in thee
1548	And in thy sons, fair slips of such a stock.
1549	Then, father Salisbury, kneel we together;
1550	And in this private plot be we the first
1551	That shall salute our rightful sovereign
1552	With honour of his birthright to the crown.
1553	
1554	BOTH	Long live our sovereign Richard, England's king!
1555	
1556	YORK	We thank you, lords. But I am not your king
1557	Till I be crown'd and that my sword be stain'd
1558	With heart-blood of the house of Lancaster;
1559	And that's not suddenly to be perform'd,
1560	But with advice and silent secrecy.
1561	Do you as I do in these dangerous days:
1562	Wink at the Duke of Suffolk's insolence,
1563	At Beaufort's pride, at Somerset's ambition,
1564	At Buckingham and all the crew of them,
1565	Till they have snared the shepherd of the flock,
1566	That virtuous prince, the good Duke Humphrey:
1567	'Tis that they seek, and they in seeking that
1568	Shall find their deaths, if York can prophesy.
1569	
1570	SALISBURY	My lord, break we off; we know your mind at full.
1571	
1572	WARWICK	My heart assures me that the Earl of Warwick
1573	Shall one day make the Duke of York a king.
1574	
1575	YORK	And, Nevil, this I do assure myself:
1576	Richard shall live to make the Earl of Warwick
1577	The greatest man in England but the king.

1598	
1599	KING HENRY VI	Stand forth, Dame Eleanor Cobham, Gloucester's wife:
1600	In sight of God and us, your guilt is great:
1601	Receive the sentence of the law for sins
1602	Such as by God's book are adjudged to death.
1603	You four, from hence to prison back again;
1604	From thence unto the place of execution:
1605	The witch in Smithfield shall be burn'd to ashes,
1606	And you three shall be strangled on the gallows.
1607	You, madam, for you are more nobly born,
1608	Despoiled of your honour in your life,
1609	Shall, after three days' open penance done,
1610	Live in your country here in banishment,
1611	With Sir John Stanley, in the Isle of Man.
1612	
1613	DUCHESS	Welcome is banishment; welcome were my death.
1614	
1615	GLOUCESTER	Eleanor, the law, thou see'st, hath judged thee:
1616	I cannot justify whom the law condemns.
1617	
1618	[Exeunt DUCHESS and other prisoners, guarded]
1619	
1620	Mine eyes are full of tears, my heart of grief.
1621	Ah, Humphrey, this dishonour in thine age
1622	Will bring thy head with sorrow to the ground!
1623	I beseech your majesty, give me leave to go;
1624	Sorrow would solace and mine age would ease.
1625	
1626	KING HENRY VI	Stay, Humphrey Duke of Gloucester: ere thou go,
1627	Give up thy staff: Henry will to himself
1628	Protector be; and God shall be my hope,
1629	My stay, my guide and lantern to my feet:
1630	And go in peace, Humphrey, no less beloved
1631	Than when thou wert protector to thy King.
1632	
1633	QUEEN MARGARET	I see no reason why a king of years
1634	Should be to be protected like a child.
1635	God and King Henry govern England's realm.
1636	Give up your staff, sir, and the king his realm.
1637	
1638	GLOUCESTER	My staff? here, noble Henry, is my staff:
1639	As willingly do I the same resign
1640	As e'er thy father Henry made it mine;
1641	And even as willingly at thy feet I leave it
1642	As others would ambitiously receive it.
1643	Farewell, good king: when I am dead and gone,
1644	May honourable peace attend thy throne!
1645	
1646	[Exit]
1647	
1648	QUEEN MARGARET	Why, now is Henry king, and Margaret queen;
1649	And Humphrey Duke of Gloucester scarce himself,
1650	That bears so shrewd a maim; two pulls at once;
1651	His lady banish'd, and a limb lopp'd off.
1652	This staff of honour raught, there let it stand
1653	Where it best fits to be, in Henry's hand.
1654	
1655	SUFFOLK	Thus droops this lofty pine and hangs his sprays;
1656	Thus Eleanor's pride dies in her youngest days.
1657	
1658	YORK	Lords, let him go. Please it your majesty,
1659	This is the day appointed for the combat;
1660	And ready are the appellant and defendant,
1661	The armourer and his man, to enter the lists,
1662	So please your highness to behold the fight.
1663	
1664	QUEEN MARGARET	Ay, good my lord; for purposely therefore
1665	Left I the court, to see this quarrel tried.
1666	
1667	KING HENRY VI	O God's name, see the lists and all things fit:
1668	Here let them end it; and God defend the right!
1669	
1670	YORK	I never saw a fellow worse bested,
1671	Or more afraid to fight, than is the appellant,
1672	The servant of this armourer, my lords.
1673	
1674	[Enter at one door, HORNER, the Armourer, and his
1675	Neighbours, drinking to him so much that he is drunk;
1676	and he enters with a drum before him and his staff
1677	with a sand-bag fastened to it; and at the other
1678	door PETER, his man, with a drum and sand-bag, and
1679	'Prentices drinking to him]
1680	
1681	First Neighbour	Here, neighbour Horner, I drink to you in a cup of
1682	sack: and fear not, neighbour, you shall do well enough.
1683	
1684	Second Neighbour	And here, neighbour, here's a cup of charneco.
1685	
1686	Third Neighbour	And here's a pot of good double beer, neighbour:
1687	drink, and fear not your man.
1688	
1689	HORNER	Let it come, i' faith, and I'll pledge you all; and
1690	a fig for Peter!
1691	
1692	First 'Prentice	Here, Peter, I drink to thee: and be not afraid.
1693	
1694	Second 'Prentice	Be merry, Peter, and fear not thy master: fight
1695	for credit of the 'prentices.
1696	
1697	PETER	I thank you all: drink, and pray for me, I pray
1698	you; for I think I have taken my last draught in
1699	this world. Here, Robin, an if I die, I give thee
1700	my apron: and, Will, thou shalt have my hammer:
1701	and here, Tom, take all the money that I have. O
1702	Lord bless me! I pray God! for I am never able to
1703	deal with my master, he hath learnt me so much fence already.
1704	
1705	SALISBURY	Come, leave your drinking, and fall to blows.
1706	Sirrah, what's thy name?
1707	
1708	PETER	Peter, forsooth.
1709	
1710	SALISBURY	Peter! what more?
1711	
1712	PETER	Thump.
1713	
1714	SALISBURY	Thump! then see thou thump thy master well.
1715	
1716	HORNER	Masters, I am come hither, as it were, upon my man's
1717	instigation, to prove him a knave and myself an
1718	honest man: and touching the Duke of York, I will
1719	take my death, I never meant him any ill, nor the
1720	king, nor the queen: and therefore, Peter, have at
1721	thee with a downright blow!
1722	
1723	YORK	Dispatch: this knave's tongue begins to double.
1724	Sound, trumpets, alarum to the combatants!
1725	
1726	[Alarum. They fight, and PETER strikes him down]
1727	
1728	HORNER	Hold, Peter, hold! I confess, I confess treason.
1729	
1730	[Dies]
1731	
1732	YORK	Take away his weapon. Fellow, thank God, and the
1733	good wine in thy master's way.
1734	
1735	PETER	O God, have I overcome mine enemy in this presence?
1736	O Peter, thou hast prevailed in right!
1737	
1738	KING HENRY VI	Go, take hence that traitor from our sight;
1739	For his death we do perceive his guilt:
1740	And God in justice hath revealed to us
1741	The truth and innocence of this poor fellow,
1742	Which he had thought to have murder'd wrongfully.
1743	Come, fellow, follow us for thy reward.
1744

1753	ACT II
1754	
1755	
1756	
1757	SCENE IV	A street.
1758	
1759	
1760	[Enter GLOUCESTER and his Servingmen, in
1761	mourning cloaks]
1762	
1763	GLOUCESTER	Thus sometimes hath the brightest day a cloud;
1764	And after summer evermore succeeds
1765	Barren winter, with his wrathful nipping cold:
1766	So cares and joys abound, as seasons fleet.
1767	Sirs, what's o'clock?
1768	
1769	Servants	Ten, my lord.
1770	
1771	GLOUCESTER	Ten is the hour that was appointed me
1772	To watch the coming of my punish'd duchess:
1773	Uneath may she endure the flinty streets,
1774	To tread them with her tender-feeling feet.
1775	Sweet Nell, ill can thy noble mind abrook
1776	The abject people gazing on thy face,
1777	With envious looks, laughing at thy shame,
1778	That erst did follow thy proud chariot-wheels
1779	When thou didst ride in triumph through the streets.
1780	But, soft! I think she comes; and I'll prepare
1781	My tear-stain'd eyes to see her miseries.
1782	
1783	[Enter the DUCHESS in a white sheet, and a taper
1784	burning in her hand; with STANLEY, the Sheriff,
1785	and Officers]
1786	
1787	Servant	So please your grace, we'll take her from the sheriff.
1788	
1789	GLOUCESTER	No, stir not, for your lives; let her pass by.
1790	
1791	DUCHESS	Come you, my lord, to see my open shame?
1792	Now thou dost penance too. Look how they gaze!
1793	See how the giddy multitude do point,
1794	And nod their heads, and throw their eyes on thee!
1795	Ah, Gloucester, hide thee from their hateful looks,
1796	And, in thy closet pent up, rue my shame,
1797	And ban thine enemies, both mine and thine!
1798	
1799	GLOUCESTER	Be patient, gentle Nell; forget this grief.
1800	
1801	DUCHESS	Ah, Gloucester, teach me to forget myself!
1802	For whilst I think I am thy married wife
1803	And thou a prince, protector of this land,
1804	Methinks I should not thus be led along,
1805	Mail'd up in shame, with papers on my back,
1806	And followed with a rabble that rejoice
1807	To see my tears and hear my deep-fet groans.
1808	The ruthless flint doth cut my tender feet,
1809	And when I start, the envious people laugh
1810	And bid me be advised how I tread.
1811	Ah, Humphrey, can I bear this shameful yoke?
1812	Trow'st thou that e'er I'll look upon the world,
1813	Or count them happy that enjoy the sun?
1814	No; dark shall be my light and night my day;
1815	To think upon my pomp shall be my hell.
1816	Sometime I'll say, I am Duke Humphrey's wife,
1817	And he a prince and ruler of the land:
1818	Yet so he ruled and such a prince he was
1819	As he stood by whilst I, his forlorn duchess,
1820	Was made a wonder and a pointing-stock
1821	To every idle rascal follower.
1822	But be thou mild and blush not at my shame,
1823	Nor stir at nothing till the axe of death
1824	Hang over thee, as, sure, it shortly will;
1825	For Suffolk, he that can do all in all
1826	With her that hateth thee and hates us all,
1827	And York and impious Beaufort, that false priest,
1828	Have all limed bushes to betray thy wings,
1829	And, fly thou how thou canst, they'll tangle thee:
1830	But fear not thou, until thy foot be snared,
1831	Nor never seek prevention of thy foes.
1832	
1833	GLOUCESTER	Ah, Nell, forbear! thou aimest all awry;
1834	I must offend before I be attainted;
1835	And had I twenty times so many foes,
1836	And each of them had twenty times their power,
1837	All these could not procure me any scathe,
1838	So long as I am loyal, true and crimeless.
1839	Wouldst have me rescue thee from this reproach?
1840	Why, yet thy scandal were not wiped away
1841	But I in danger for the breach of law.
1842	Thy greatest help is quiet, gentle Nell:
1843	I pray thee, sort thy heart to patience;
1844	These few days' wonder will be quickly worn.
1845	
1846	[Enter a Herald]
1847	
1848	Herald	I summon your grace to his majesty's parliament,
1849	Holden at Bury the first of this next month.
1850	
1851	GLOUCESTER	And my consent ne'er ask'd herein before!
1852	This is close dealing. Well, I will be there.
1853	
1854	[Exit Herald]
1855	
1856	My Nell, I take my leave: and, master sheriff,
1857	Let not her penance exceed the king's commission.
1858	
1859	Sheriff	An't please your grace, here my commission stays,
1860	And Sir John Stanley is appointed now
1861	To take her with him to the Isle of Man.
1862	
1863	GLOUCESTER	Must you, Sir John, protect my lady here?
1864	
1865	STANLEY	So am I given in charge, may't please your grace.
1866	
1867	GLOUCESTER	Entreat her not the worse in that I pray
1868	You use her well: the world may laugh again;
1869	And I may live to do you kindness if
1870	You do it her: and so, Sir John, farewell!
1871	
1872	DUCHESS	What, gone, my lord, and bid me not farewell!
1873	
1874	GLOUCESTER	Witness my tears, I cannot stay to speak.
1875	
1876	[Exeunt GLOUCESTER and Servingmen]
1877	
1878	DUCHESS	Art thou gone too? all comfort go with thee!
1879	For none abides with me: my joy is death;
1880	Death, at whose name I oft have been afear'd,
1881	Because I wish'd this world's eternity.
1882	Stanley, I prithee, go, and take me hence;
1883	I care not whither, for I beg no favour,
1884	Only convey me where thou art commanded.
1885	
1886	STANLEY	Why, madam, that is to the Isle of Man;
1887	There to be used according to your state.
1888	
1889	DUCHESS	That's bad enough, for I am but reproach:
1890	And shall I then be used reproachfully?
1891	
1892	STANLEY	Like to a duchess, and Duke Humphrey's lady;
1893	According to that state you shall be used.
1894	
1895	DUCHESS	Sheriff, farewell, and better than I fare,
1896	Although thou hast been conduct of my shame.
1897	
1898	Sheriff	It is my office; and, madam, pardon me.
1899	
1900	DUCHESS	Ay, ay, farewell; thy office is discharged.
1901	Come, Stanley, shall we go?
1902	
1903	STANLEY	Madam, your penance done, throw off this sheet,
1904	And go we to attire you for our journey.
1905	
1906	DUCHESS	My shame will not be shifted with my sheet:
1907	No, it will hang upon my richest robes
1908	And show itself, attire me how I can.
1909	Go, lead the way; I long to see my prison.

1918	
1919	ACT III
1920	
1921	
1922	
1923	SCENE I	The Abbey at Bury St. Edmund's.
1924	
1925	
1926	[Sound a sennet. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN
1927	MARGARET, CARDINAL, SUFFOLK, YORK, BUCKINGHAM,
1928	SALISBURY and WARWICK to the Parliament]
1929	
1930	KING HENRY VI	I muse my Lord of Gloucester is not come:
1931	'Tis not his wont to be the hindmost man,
1932	Whate'er occasion keeps him from us now.
1933	
1934	QUEEN MARGARET	Can you not see? or will ye not observe
1935	The strangeness of his alter'd countenance?
1936	With what a majesty he bears himself,
1937	How insolent of late he is become,
1938	How proud, how peremptory, and unlike himself?
1939	We know the time since he was mild and affable,
1940	And if we did but glance a far-off look,
1941	Immediately he was upon his knee,
1942	That all the court admired him for submission:
1943	But meet him now, and, be it in the morn,
1944	When every one will give the time of day,
1945	He knits his brow and shows an angry eye,
1946	And passeth by with stiff unbowed knee,
1947	Disdaining duty that to us belongs.
1948	Small curs are not regarded when they grin;
1949	But great men tremble when the lion roars;
1950	And Humphrey is no little man in England.
1951	First note that he is near you in descent,
1952	And should you fall, he as the next will mount.
1953	Me seemeth then it is no policy,
1954	Respecting what a rancorous mind he bears
1955	And his advantage following your decease,
1956	That he should come about your royal person
1957	Or be admitted to your highness' council.
1958	By flattery hath he won the commons' hearts,
1959	And when he please to make commotion,
1960	'Tis to be fear'd they all will follow him.
1961	Now 'tis the spring, and weeds are shallow-rooted;
1962	Suffer them now, and they'll o'ergrow the garden
1963	And choke the herbs for want of husbandry.
1964	The reverent care I bear unto my lord
1965	Made me collect these dangers in the duke.
1966	If it be fond, call it a woman's fear;
1967	Which fear if better reasons can supplant,
1968	I will subscribe and say I wrong'd the duke.
1969	My Lord of Suffolk, Buckingham, and York,
1970	Reprove my allegation, if you can;
1971	Or else conclude my words effectual.
1972	
1973	SUFFOLK	Well hath your highness seen into this duke;
1974	And, had I first been put to speak my mind,
1975	I think I should have told your grace's tale.
1976	The duchess, by his subornation,
1977	Upon my life, began her devilish practises:
1978	Or, if he were not privy to those faults,
1979	Yet, by reputing of his high descent,
1980	As next the king he was successive heir,
1981	And such high vaunts of his nobility,
1982	Did instigate the bedlam brain-sick duchess
1983	By wicked means to frame our sovereign's fall.
1984	Smooth runs the water where the brook is deep;
1985	And in his simple show he harbours treason.
1986	The fox barks not when he would steal the lamb.
1987	No, no, my sovereign; Gloucester is a man
1988	Unsounded yet and full of deep deceit.
1989	
1990	CARDINAL	Did he not, contrary to form of law,
1991	Devise strange deaths for small offences done?
1992	
1993	YORK	And did he not, in his protectorship,
1994	Levy great sums of money through the realm
1995	For soldiers' pay in France, and never sent it?
1996	By means whereof the towns each day revolted.
1997	
1998	BUCKINGHAM	Tut, these are petty faults to faults unknown.
1999	Which time will bring to light in smooth
2000	Duke Humphrey.
2001	
2002	KING HENRY VI	My lords, at once: the care you have of us,
2003	To mow down thorns that would annoy our foot,
2004	Is worthy praise: but, shall I speak my conscience,
2005	Our kinsman Gloucester is as innocent
2006	From meaning treason to our royal person
2007	As is the sucking lamb or harmless dove:
2008	The duke is virtuous, mild and too well given
2009	To dream on evil or to work my downfall.
2010	
2011	QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, what's more dangerous than this fond affiance!
2012	Seems he a dove? his feathers are but borrowed,
2013	For he's disposed as the hateful raven:
2014	Is he a lamb? his skin is surely lent him,
2015	For he's inclined as is the ravenous wolf.
2016	Who cannot steal a shape that means deceit?
2017	Take heed, my lord; the welfare of us all
2018	Hangs on the cutting short that fraudful man.
2019	
2020	[Enter SOMERSET]
2021	
2022	SOMERSET	All health unto my gracious sovereign!
2023	
2024	KING HENRY VI	Welcome, Lord Somerset. What news from France?
2025	
2026	SOMERSET	That all your interest in those territories
2027	Is utterly bereft you; all is lost.
2028	
2029	KING HENRY VI	Cold news, Lord Somerset: but God's will be done!
2030	
2031	YORK	[Aside]  Cold news for me; for I had hope of France
2032	As firmly as I hope for fertile England.
2033	Thus are my blossoms blasted in the bud
2034	And caterpillars eat my leaves away;
2035	But I will remedy this gear ere long,
2036	Or sell my title for a glorious grave.
2037	
2038	[Enter GLOUCESTER]
2039	
2040	GLOUCESTER	All happiness unto my lord the king!
2041	Pardon, my liege, that I have stay'd so long.
2042	
2043	SUFFOLK	Nay, Gloucester, know that thou art come too soon,
2044	Unless thou wert more loyal than thou art:
2045	I do arrest thee of high treason here.
2046	
2047	GLOUCESTER	Well, Suffolk, thou shalt not see me blush
2048	Nor change my countenance for this arrest:
2049	A heart unspotted is not easily daunted.
2050	The purest spring is not so free from mud
2051	As I am clear from treason to my sovereign:
2052	Who can accuse me? wherein am I guilty?
2053	
2054	YORK	'Tis thought, my lord, that you took bribes of France,
2055	And, being protector, stayed the soldiers' pay;
2056	By means whereof his highness hath lost France.
2057	
2058	GLOUCESTER	Is it but thought so? what are they that think it?
2059	I never robb'd the soldiers of their pay,
2060	Nor ever had one penny bribe from France.
2061	So help me God, as I have watch'd the night,
2062	Ay, night by night, in studying good for England,
2063	That doit that e'er I wrested from the king,
2064	Or any groat I hoarded to my use,
2065	Be brought against me at my trial-day!
2066	No; many a pound of mine own proper store,
2067	Because I would not tax the needy commons,
2068	Have I disbursed to the garrisons,
2069	And never ask'd for restitution.
2070	
2071	CARDINAL	It serves you well, my lord, to say so much.
2072	
2073	GLOUCESTER	I say no more than truth, so help me God!
2074	
2075	YORK	In your protectorship you did devise
2076	Strange tortures for offenders never heard of,
2077	That England was defamed by tyranny.
2078	
2079	GLOUCESTER	Why, 'tis well known that, whiles I was
2080	protector,
2081	Pity was all the fault that was in me;
2082	For I should melt at an offender's tears,
2083	And lowly words were ransom for their fault.
2084	Unless it were a bloody murderer,
2085	Or foul felonious thief that fleeced poor passengers,
2086	I never gave them condign punishment:
2087	Murder indeed, that bloody sin, I tortured
2088	Above the felon or what trespass else.
2089	
2090	SUFFOLK	My lord, these faults are easy, quickly answered:
2091	But mightier crimes are laid unto your charge,
2092	Whereof you cannot easily purge yourself.
2093	I do arrest you in his highness' name;
2094	And here commit you to my lord cardinal
2095	To keep, until your further time of trial.
2096	
2097	KING HENRY VI	My lord of Gloucester, 'tis my special hope
2098	That you will clear yourself from all suspect:
2099	My conscience tells me you are innocent.
2100	
2101	GLOUCESTER	Ah, gracious lord, these days are dangerous:
2102	Virtue is choked with foul ambition
2103	And charity chased hence by rancour's hand;
2104	Foul subornation is predominant
2105	And equity exiled your highness' land.
2106	I know their complot is to have my life,
2107	And if my death might make this island happy,
2108	And prove the period of their tyranny,
2109	I would expend it with all willingness:
2110	But mine is made the prologue to their play;
2111	For thousands more, that yet suspect no peril,
2112	Will not conclude their plotted tragedy.
2113	Beaufort's red sparkling eyes blab his heart's malice,
2114	And Suffolk's cloudy brow his stormy hate;
2115	Sharp Buckingham unburthens with his tongue
2116	The envious load that lies upon his heart;
2117	And dogged York, that reaches at the moon,
2118	Whose overweening arm I have pluck'd back,
2119	By false accuse doth level at my life:
2120	And you, my sovereign lady, with the rest,
2121	Causeless have laid disgraces on my head,
2122	And with your best endeavour have stirr'd up
2123	My liefest liege to be mine enemy:
2124	Ay, all you have laid your heads together--
2125	Myself had notice of your conventicles--
2126	And all to make away my guiltless life.
2127	I shall not want false witness to condemn me,
2128	Nor store of treasons to augment my guilt;
2129	The ancient proverb will be well effected:
2130	'A staff is quickly found to beat a dog.'
2131	
2132	CARDINAL	My liege, his railing is intolerable:
2133	If those that care to keep your royal person
2134	From treason's secret knife and traitors' rage
2135	Be thus upbraided, chid and rated at,
2136	And the offender granted scope of speech,
2137	'Twill make them cool in zeal unto your grace.
2138	
2139	SUFFOLK	Hath he not twit our sovereign lady here
2140	With ignominious words, though clerkly couch'd,
2141	As if she had suborned some to swear
2142	False allegations to o'erthrow his state?
2143	
2144	QUEEN MARGARET	But I can give the loser leave to chide.
2145	
2146	GLOUCESTER	Far truer spoke than meant: I lose, indeed;
2147	Beshrew the winners, for they play'd me false!
2148	And well such losers may have leave to speak.
2149	
2150	BUCKINGHAM	He'll wrest the sense and hold us here all day:
2151	Lord cardinal, he is your prisoner.
2152	
2153	CARDINAL	Sirs, take away the duke, and guard him sure.
2154	
2155	GLOUCESTER	Ah! thus King Henry throws away his crutch
2156	Before his legs be firm to bear his body.
2157	Thus is the shepherd beaten from thy side,
2158	And wolves are gnarling who shall gnaw thee first.
2159	Ah, that my fear were false! ah, that it were!
2160	For, good King Henry, thy decay I fear.
2161	
2162	[Exit, guarded]
2163	
2164	KING HENRY VI	My lords, what to your wisdoms seemeth best,
2165	Do or undo, as if ourself were here.
2166	
2167	QUEEN MARGARET	What, will your highness leave the parliament?
2168	
2169	KING HENRY VI	Ay, Margaret; my heart is drown'd with grief,
2170	Whose flood begins to flow within mine eyes,
2171	My body round engirt with misery,
2172	For what's more miserable than discontent?
2173	Ah, uncle Humphrey! in thy face I see
2174	The map of honour, truth and loyalty:
2175	And yet, good Humphrey, is the hour to come
2176	That e'er I proved thee false or fear'd thy faith.
2177	What louring star now envies thy estate,
2178	That these great lords and Margaret our queen
2179	Do seek subversion of thy harmless life?
2180	Thou never didst them wrong, nor no man wrong;
2181	And as the butcher takes away the calf
2182	And binds the wretch, and beats it when it strays,
2183	Bearing it to the bloody slaughter-house,
2184	Even so remorseless have they borne him hence;
2185	And as the dam runs lowing up and down,
2186	Looking the way her harmless young one went,
2187	And can do nought but wail her darling's loss,
2188	Even so myself bewails good Gloucester's case
2189	With sad unhelpful tears, and with dimm'd eyes
2190	Look after him and cannot do him good,
2191	So mighty are his vowed enemies.
2192	His fortunes I will weep; and, 'twixt each groan
2193	Say 'Who's a traitor? Gloucester he is none.'
2194	
2195	[Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET, CARDINAL,
2196	SUFFOLK, and YORK; SOMERSET remains apart]
2197	
2198	QUEEN MARGARET	Free lords, cold snow melts with the sun's hot beams.
2199	Henry my lord is cold in great affairs,
2200	Too full of foolish pity, and Gloucester's show
2201	Beguiles him as the mournful crocodile
2202	With sorrow snares relenting passengers,
2203	Or as the snake roll'd in a flowering bank,
2204	With shining chequer'd slough, doth sting a child
2205	That for the beauty thinks it excellent.
2206	Believe me, lords, were none more wise than I--
2207	And yet herein I judge mine own wit good--
2208	This Gloucester should be quickly rid the world,
2209	To rid us of the fear we have of him.
2210	
2211	CARDINAL	That he should die is worthy policy;
2212	But yet we want a colour for his death:
2213	'Tis meet he be condemn'd by course of law.
2214	
2215	SUFFOLK	But, in my mind, that were no policy:
2216	The king will labour still to save his life,
2217	The commons haply rise, to save his life;
2218	And yet we have but trivial argument,
2219	More than mistrust, that shows him worthy death.
2220	
2221	YORK	So that, by this, you would not have him die.
2222	
2223	SUFFOLK	Ah, York, no man alive so fain as I!
2224	
2225	YORK	'Tis York that hath more reason for his death.
2226	But, my lord cardinal, and you, my Lord of Suffolk,
2227	Say as you think, and speak it from your souls,
2228	Were't not all one, an empty eagle were set
2229	To guard the chicken from a hungry kite,
2230	As place Duke Humphrey for the king's protector?
2231	
2232	QUEEN MARGARET	So the poor chicken should be sure of death.
2233	
2234	SUFFOLK	Madam, 'tis true; and were't not madness, then,
2235	To make the fox surveyor of the fold?
2236	Who being accused a crafty murderer,
2237	His guilt should be but idly posted over,
2238	Because his purpose is not executed.
2239	No; let him die, in that he is a fox,
2240	By nature proved an enemy to the flock,
2241	Before his chaps be stain'd with crimson blood,
2242	As Humphrey, proved by reasons, to my liege.
2243	And do not stand on quillets how to slay him:
2244	Be it by gins, by snares, by subtlety,
2245	Sleeping or waking, 'tis no matter how,
2246	So he be dead; for that is good deceit
2247	Which mates him first that first intends deceit.
2248	
2249	QUEEN MARGARET	Thrice-noble Suffolk, 'tis resolutely spoke.
2250	
2251	SUFFOLK	Not resolute, except so much were done;
2252	For things are often spoke and seldom meant:
2253	But that my heart accordeth with my tongue,
2254	Seeing the deed is meritorious,
2255	And to preserve my sovereign from his foe,
2256	Say but the word, and I will be his priest.
2257	
2258	CARDINAL	But I would have him dead, my Lord of Suffolk,
2259	Ere you can take due orders for a priest:
2260	Say you consent and censure well the deed,
2261	And I'll provide his executioner,
2262	I tender so the safety of my liege.
2263	
2264	SUFFOLK	Here is my hand, the deed is worthy doing.
2265	
2266	QUEEN MARGARET	And so say I.
2267	
2268	YORK	And I    and now we three have spoke it,
2269	It skills not greatly who impugns our doom.
2270	
2271	[Enter a Post]
2272	
2273	Post	Great lords, from Ireland am I come amain,
2274	To signify that rebels there are up
2275	And put the Englishmen unto the sword:
2276	Send succors, lords, and stop the rage betime,
2277	Before the wound do grow uncurable;
2278	For, being green, there is great hope of help.
2279	
2280	CARDINAL	A breach that craves a quick expedient stop!
2281	What counsel give you in this weighty cause?
2282	
2283	YORK	That Somerset be sent as regent thither:
2284	'Tis meet that lucky ruler be employ'd;
2285	Witness the fortune he hath had in France.
2286	
2287	SOMERSET	If York, with all his far-fet policy,
2288	Had been the regent there instead of me,
2289	He never would have stay'd in France so long.
2290	
2291	YORK	No, not to lose it all, as thou hast done:
2292	I rather would have lost my life betimes
2293	Than bring a burthen of dishonour home
2294	By staying there so long till all were lost.
2295	Show me one scar character'd on thy skin:
2296	Men's flesh preserved so whole do seldom win.
2297	
2298	QUEEN MARGARET	Nay, then, this spark will prove a raging fire,
2299	If wind and fuel be brought to feed it with:
2300	No more, good York; sweet Somerset, be still:
2301	Thy fortune, York, hadst thou been regent there,
2302	Might happily have proved far worse than his.
2303	
2304	YORK	What, worse than nought? nay, then, a shame take all!
2305	
2306	SOMERSET	And, in the number, thee that wishest shame!
2307	
2308	CARDINAL	My Lord of York, try what your fortune is.
2309	The uncivil kerns of Ireland are in arms
2310	And temper clay with blood of Englishmen:
2311	To Ireland will you lead a band of men,
2312	Collected choicely, from each county some,
2313	And try your hap against the Irishmen?
2314	
2315	YORK	I will, my lord, so please his majesty.
2316	
2317	SUFFOLK	Why, our authority is his consent,
2318	And what we do establish he confirms:
2319	Then, noble York, take thou this task in hand.
2320	
2321	YORK	I am content: provide me soldiers, lords,
2322	Whiles I take order for mine own affairs.
2323	
2324	SUFFOLK	A charge, Lord York, that I will see perform'd.
2325	But now return we to the false Duke Humphrey.
2326	
2327	CARDINAL	No more of him; for I will deal with him
2328	That henceforth he shall trouble us no more.
2329	And so break off; the day is almost spent:
2330	Lord Suffolk, you and I must talk of that event.
2331	
2332	YORK	My Lord of Suffolk, within fourteen days
2333	At Bristol I expect my soldiers;
2334	For there I'll ship them all for Ireland.
2335	
2336	SUFFOLK	I'll see it truly done, my Lord of York.
2337	
2338	[Exeunt all but YORK]
2339	
2340	YORK	Now, York, or never, steel thy fearful thoughts,
2341	And change misdoubt to resolution:
2342	Be that thou hopest to be, or what thou art
2343	Resign to death; it is not worth the enjoying:
2344	Let pale-faced fear keep with the mean-born man,
2345	And find no harbour in a royal heart.
2346	Faster than spring-time showers comes thought
2347	on thought,
2348	And not a thought but thinks on dignity.
2349	My brain more busy than the labouring spider
2350	Weaves tedious snares to trap mine enemies.
2351	Well, nobles, well, 'tis politicly done,
2352	To send me packing with an host of men:
2353	I fear me you but warm the starved snake,
2354	Who, cherish'd in your breasts, will sting
2355	your hearts.
2356	'Twas men I lack'd and you will give them me:
2357	I take it kindly; and yet be well assured
2358	You put sharp weapons in a madman's hands.
2359	Whiles I in Ireland nourish a mighty band,
2360	I will stir up in England some black storm
2361	Shall blow ten thousand souls to heaven or hell;
2362	And this fell tempest shall not cease to rage
2363	Until the golden circuit on my head,
2364	Like to the glorious sun's transparent beams,
2365	Do calm the fury of this mad-bred flaw.
2366	And, for a minister of my intent,
2367	I have seduced a headstrong Kentishman,
2368	John Cade of Ashford,
2369	To make commotion, as full well he can,
2370	Under the title of John Mortimer.
2371	In Ireland have I seen this stubborn Cade
2372	Oppose himself against a troop of kerns,
2373	And fought so long, till that his thighs with darts
2374	Were almost like a sharp-quill'd porpentine;
2375	And, in the end being rescued, I have seen
2376	Him caper upright like a wild Morisco,
2377	Shaking the bloody darts as he his bells.
2378	Full often, like a shag-hair'd crafty kern,
2379	Hath he conversed with the enemy,
2380	And undiscover'd come to me again
2381	And given me notice of their villanies.
2382	This devil here shall be my substitute;
2383	For that John Mortimer, which now is dead,
2384	In face, in gait, in speech, he doth resemble:
2385	By this I shall perceive the commons' mind,
2386	How they affect the house and claim of York.
2387	Say he be taken, rack'd and tortured,
2388	I know no pain they can inflict upon him
2389	Will make him say I moved him to those arms.
2390	Say that he thrive, as 'tis great like he will,
2391	Why, then from Ireland come I with my strength
2392	And reap the harvest which that rascal sow'd;
2393	For Humphrey being dead, as he shall be,
2394	And Henry put apart, the next for me.

2404	ACT III
2405	
2406	
2407	
2408	SCENE II	Bury St. Edmund's. A room of state.
2409	
2410	
2411	[Enter certain Murderers, hastily]
2412	
2413	First Murderer	Run to my Lord of Suffolk; let him know
2414	We have dispatch'd the duke, as he commanded.
2415	
2416	Second Murderer	O that it were to do! What have we done?
2417	Didst ever hear a man so penitent?
2418	
2419	[Enter SUFFOLK]
2420	
2421	First Murder	Here comes my lord.
2422	
2423	SUFFOLK	Now, sirs, have you dispatch'd this thing?
2424	
2425	First Murderer	Ay, my good lord, he's dead.
2426	
2427	SUFFOLK	Why, that's well said. Go, get you to my house;
2428	I will reward you for this venturous deed.
2429	The king and all the peers are here at hand.
2430	Have you laid fair the bed? Is all things well,
2431	According as I gave directions?
2432	
2433	First Murderer	'Tis, my good lord.
2434	
2435	SUFFOLK	Away! be gone.
2436	
2437	[Exeunt Murderers]
2438	
2439	[Sound trumpets. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN
2440	MARGARET, CARDINAL, SOMERSET, with Attendants]
2441	
2442	KING HENRY VI	Go, call our uncle to our presence straight;
2443	Say we intend to try his grace to-day.
2444	If he be guilty, as 'tis published.
2445	
2446	SUFFOLK	I'll call him presently, my noble lord.
2447	
2448	[Exit]
2449	
2450	KING HENRY VI	Lords, take your places; and, I pray you all,
2451	Proceed no straiter 'gainst our uncle Gloucester
2452	Than from true evidence of good esteem
2453	He be approved in practise culpable.
2454	
2455	QUEEN MARGARET	God forbid any malice should prevail,
2456	That faultless may condemn a nobleman!
2457	Pray God he may acquit him of suspicion!
2458	
2459	KING HENRY VI	I thank thee, Meg; these words content me much.
2460	
2461	[Re-enter SUFFOLK]
2462	
2463	How now! why look'st thou pale? why tremblest thou?
2464	Where is our uncle? what's the matter, Suffolk?
2465	
2466	SUFFOLK	Dead in his bed, my lord; Gloucester is dead.
2467	
2468	QUEEN MARGARET	Marry, God forfend!
2469	
2470	CARDINAL	God's secret judgment: I did dream to-night
2471	The duke was dumb and could not speak a word.
2472	
2473	[KING HENRY VI swoons]
2474	
2475	QUEEN MARGARET	How fares my lord? Help, lords! the king is dead.
2476	
2477	SOMERSET	Rear up his body; wring him by the nose.
2478	
2479	QUEEN MARGARET	Run, go, help, help! O Henry, ope thine eyes!
2480	
2481	SUFFOLK	He doth revive again: madam, be patient.
2482	
2483	KING HENRY VI	O heavenly God!
2484	
2485	QUEEN MARGARET	How fares my gracious lord?
2486	
2487	SUFFOLK	Comfort, my sovereign! gracious Henry, comfort!
2488	
2489	KING HENRY VI	What, doth my Lord of Suffolk comfort me?
2490	Came he right now to sing a raven's note,
2491	Whose dismal tune bereft my vital powers;
2492	And thinks he that the chirping of a wren,
2493	By crying comfort from a hollow breast,
2494	Can chase away the first-conceived sound?
2495	Hide not thy poison with such sugar'd words;
2496	Lay not thy hands on me; forbear, I say;
2497	Their touch affrights me as a serpent's sting.
2498	Thou baleful messenger, out of my sight!
2499	Upon thy eye-balls murderous tyranny
2500	Sits in grim majesty, to fright the world.
2501	Look not upon me, for thine eyes are wounding:
2502	Yet do not go away: come, basilisk,
2503	And kill the innocent gazer with thy sight;
2504	For in the shade of death I shall find joy;
2505	In life but double death, now Gloucester's dead.
2506	
2507	QUEEN MARGARET	Why do you rate my Lord of Suffolk thus?
2508	Although the duke was enemy to him,
2509	Yet he most Christian-like laments his death:
2510	And for myself, foe as he was to me,
2511	Might liquid tears or heart-offending groans
2512	Or blood-consuming sighs recall his life,
2513	I would be blind with weeping, sick with groans,
2514	Look pale as primrose with blood-drinking sighs,
2515	And all to have the noble duke alive.
2516	What know I how the world may deem of me?
2517	For it is known we were but hollow friends:
2518	It may be judged I made the duke away;
2519	So shall my name with slander's tongue be wounded,
2520	And princes' courts be fill'd with my reproach.
2521	This get I by his death: ay me, unhappy!
2522	To be a queen, and crown'd with infamy!
2523	
2524	KING HENRY VI	Ah, woe is me for Gloucester, wretched man!
2525	
2526	QUEEN MARGARET	Be woe for me, more wretched than he is.
2527	What, dost thou turn away and hide thy face?
2528	I am no loathsome leper; look on me.
2529	What! art thou, like the adder, waxen deaf?
2530	Be poisonous too and kill thy forlorn queen.
2531	Is all thy comfort shut in Gloucester's tomb?
2532	Why, then, dame Margaret was ne'er thy joy.
2533	Erect his statue and worship it,
2534	And make my image but an alehouse sign.
2535	Was I for this nigh wreck'd upon the sea
2536	And twice by awkward wind from England's bank
2537	Drove back again unto my native clime?
2538	What boded this, but well forewarning wind
2539	Did seem to say 'Seek not a scorpion's nest,
2540	Nor set no footing on this unkind shore'?
2541	What did I then, but cursed the gentle gusts
2542	And he that loosed them forth their brazen caves:
2543	And bid them blow towards England's blessed shore,
2544	Or turn our stern upon a dreadful rock
2545	Yet AEolus would not be a murderer,
2546	But left that hateful office unto thee:
2547	The pretty-vaulting sea refused to drown me,
2548	Knowing that thou wouldst have me drown'd on shore,
2549	With tears as salt as sea, through thy unkindness:
2550	The splitting rocks cower'd in the sinking sands
2551	And would not dash me with their ragged sides,
2552	Because thy flinty heart, more hard than they,
2553	Might in thy palace perish Margaret.
2554	As far as I could ken thy chalky cliffs,
2555	When from thy shore the tempest beat us back,
2556	I stood upon the hatches in the storm,
2557	And when the dusky sky began to rob
2558	My earnest-gaping sight of thy land's view,
2559	I took a costly jewel from my neck,
2560	A heart it was, bound in with diamonds,
2561	And threw it towards thy land: the sea received it,
2562	And so I wish'd thy body might my heart:
2563	And even with this I lost fair England's view
2564	And bid mine eyes be packing with my heart
2565	And call'd them blind and dusky spectacles,
2566	For losing ken of Albion's wished coast.
2567	How often have I tempted Suffolk's tongue,
2568	The agent of thy foul inconstancy,
2569	To sit and witch me, as Ascanius did
2570	When he to madding Dido would unfold
2571	His father's acts commenced in burning Troy!
2572	Am I not witch'd like her? or thou not false like him?
2573	Ay me, I can no more! die, Margaret!
2574	For Henry weeps that thou dost live so long.
2575	
2576	[Noise within. Enter WARWICK, SALISBURY, and many Commons]
2577	
2578	WARWICK	It is reported, mighty sovereign,
2579	That good Duke Humphrey traitorously is murder'd
2580	By Suffolk and the Cardinal Beaufort's means.
2581	The commons, like an angry hive of bees
2582	That want their leader, scatter up and down
2583	And care not who they sting in his revenge.
2584	Myself have calm'd their spleenful mutiny,
2585	Until they hear the order of his death.
2586	
2587	KING HENRY VI	That he is dead, good Warwick, 'tis too true;
2588	But how he died God knows, not Henry:
2589	Enter his chamber, view his breathless corpse,
2590	And comment then upon his sudden death.
2591	
2592	WARWICK	That shall I do, my liege. Stay, Salisbury,
2593	With the rude multitude till I return.
2594	
2595	[Exit]
2596	
2597	KING HENRY VI	O Thou that judgest all things, stay my thoughts,
2598	My thoughts, that labour to persuade my soul
2599	Some violent hands were laid on Humphrey's life!
2600	If my suspect be false, forgive me, God,
2601	For judgment only doth belong to thee.
2602	Fain would I go to chafe his paly lips
2603	With twenty thousand kisses, and to drain
2604	Upon his face an ocean of salt tears,
2605	To tell my love unto his dumb deaf trunk,
2606	And with my fingers feel his hand unfeeling:
2607	But all in vain are these mean obsequies;
2608	And to survey his dead and earthly image,
2609	What were it but to make my sorrow greater?
2610	
2611	[Re-enter WARWICK and others, bearing
2612	GLOUCESTER'S body on a bed]
2613	
2614	WARWICK	Come hither, gracious sovereign, view this body.
2615	
2616	KING HENRY VI	That is to see how deep my grave is made;
2617	For with his soul fled all my worldly solace,
2618	For seeing him I see my life in death.
2619	
2620	WARWICK	As surely as my soul intends to live
2621	With that dread King that took our state upon him
2622	To free us from his father's wrathful curse,
2623	I do believe that violent hands were laid
2624	Upon the life of this thrice-famed duke.
2625	
2626	SUFFOLK	A dreadful oath, sworn with a solemn tongue!
2627	What instance gives Lord Warwick for his vow?
2628	
2629	WARWICK	See how the blood is settled in his face.
2630	Oft have I seen a timely-parted ghost,
2631	Of ashy semblance, meagre, pale and bloodless,
2632	Being all descended to the labouring heart;
2633	Who, in the conflict that it holds with death,
2634	Attracts the same for aidance 'gainst the enemy;
2635	Which with the heart there cools and ne'er returneth
2636	To blush and beautify the cheek again.
2637	But see, his face is black and full of blood,
2638	His eye-balls further out than when he lived,
2639	Staring full ghastly like a strangled man;
2640	His hair uprear'd, his nostrils stretched with struggling;
2641	His hands abroad display'd, as one that grasp'd
2642	And tugg'd for life and was by strength subdued:
2643	Look, on the sheets his hair you see, is sticking;
2644	His well-proportion'd beard made rough and rugged,
2645	Like to the summer's corn by tempest lodged.
2646	It cannot be but he was murder'd here;
2647	The least of all these signs were probable.
2648	
2649	SUFFOLK	Why, Warwick, who should do the duke to death?
2650	Myself and Beaufort had him in protection;
2651	And we, I hope, sir, are no murderers.
2652	
2653	WARWICK	But both of you were vow'd Duke Humphrey's foes,
2654	And you, forsooth, had the good duke to keep:
2655	'Tis like you would not feast him like a friend;
2656	And 'tis well seen he found an enemy.
2657	
2658	QUEEN MARGARET	Then you, belike, suspect these noblemen
2659	As guilty of Duke Humphrey's timeless death.
2660	
2661	WARWICK	Who finds the heifer dead and bleeding fresh
2662	And sees fast by a butcher with an axe,
2663	But will suspect 'twas he that made the slaughter?
2664	Who finds the partridge in the puttock's nest,
2665	But may imagine how the bird was dead,
2666	Although the kite soar with unbloodied beak?
2667	Even so suspicious is this tragedy.
2668	
2669	QUEEN MARGARET	Are you the butcher, Suffolk? Where's your knife?
2670	Is Beaufort term'd a kite? Where are his talons?
2671	
2672	SUFFOLK	I wear no knife to slaughter sleeping men;
2673	But here's a vengeful sword, rusted with ease,
2674	That shall be scoured in his rancorous heart
2675	That slanders me with murder's crimson badge.
2676	Say, if thou darest, proud Lord of Warwick-shire,
2677	That I am faulty in Duke Humphrey's death.
2678	
2679	[Exeunt CARDINAL, SOMERSET, and others]
2680	
2681	WARWICK	What dares not Warwick, if false Suffolk dare him?
2682	
2683	QUEEN MARGARET	He dares not calm his contumelious spirit
2684	Nor cease to be an arrogant controller,
2685	Though Suffolk dare him twenty thousand times.
2686	
2687	WARWICK	Madam, be still; with reverence may I say;
2688	For every word you speak in his behalf
2689	Is slander to your royal dignity.
2690	
2691	SUFFOLK	Blunt-witted lord, ignoble in demeanor!
2692	If ever lady wrong'd her lord so much,
2693	Thy mother took into her blameful bed
2694	Some stern untutor'd churl, and noble stock
2695	Was graft with crab-tree slip; whose fruit thou art,
2696	And never of the Nevils' noble race.
2697	
2698	WARWICK	But that the guilt of murder bucklers thee
2699	And I should rob the deathsman of his fee,
2700	Quitting thee thereby of ten thousand shames,
2701	And that my sovereign's presence makes me mild,
2702	I would, false murderous coward, on thy knee
2703	Make thee beg pardon for thy passed speech,
2704	And say it was thy mother that thou meant'st
2705	That thou thyself was born in bastardy;
2706	And after all this fearful homage done,
2707	Give thee thy hire and send thy soul to hell,
2708	Pernicious blood-sucker of sleeping men!
2709	
2710	SUFFOLK	Thou shall be waking well I shed thy blood,
2711	If from this presence thou darest go with me.
2712	
2713	WARWICK	Away even now, or I will drag thee hence:
2714	Unworthy though thou art, I'll cope with thee
2715	And do some service to Duke Humphrey's ghost.
2716	
2717	[Exeunt SUFFOLK and WARWICK]
2718	
2719	KING HENRY VI	What stronger breastplate than a heart untainted!
2720	Thrice is he armed that hath his quarrel just,
2721	And he but naked, though lock'd up in steel
2722	Whose conscience with injustice is corrupted.
2723	
2724	[A noise within]
2725	
2726	QUEEN MARGARET	What noise is this?
2727	
2728	[Re-enter SUFFOLK and WARWICK, with their
2729	weapons drawn]
2730	
2731	KING HENRY VI	Why, how now, lords! your wrathful weapons drawn
2732	Here in our presence! dare you be so bold?
2733	Why, what tumultuous clamour have we here?
2734	
2735	SUFFOLK	The traitorous Warwick with the men of Bury
2736	Set all upon me, mighty sovereign.
2737	
2738	SALISBURY	[To the Commons, entering]  Sirs, stand apart;
2739	the king shall know your mind.
2740	Dread lord, the commons send you word by me,
2741	Unless Lord Suffolk straight be done to death,
2742	Or banished fair England's territories,
2743	They will by violence tear him from your palace
2744	And torture him with grievous lingering death.
2745	They say, by him the good Duke Humphrey died;
2746	They say, in him they fear your highness' death;
2747	And mere instinct of love and loyalty,
2748	Free from a stubborn opposite intent,
2749	As being thought to contradict your liking,
2750	Makes them thus forward in his banishment.
2751	They say, in care of your most royal person,
2752	That if your highness should intend to sleep
2753	And charge that no man should disturb your rest
2754	In pain of your dislike or pain of death,
2755	Yet, notwithstanding such a strait edict,
2756	Were there a serpent seen, with forked tongue,
2757	That slily glided towards your majesty,
2758	It were but necessary you were waked,
2759	Lest, being suffer'd in that harmful slumber,
2760	The mortal worm might make the sleep eternal;
2761	And therefore do they cry, though you forbid,
2762	That they will guard you, whether you will or no,
2763	From such fell serpents as false Suffolk is,
2764	With whose envenomed and fatal sting,
2765	Your loving uncle, twenty times his worth,
2766	They say, is shamefully bereft of life.
2767	
2768	Commons	[Within]  An answer from the king, my
2769	Lord of Salisbury!
2770	
2771	SUFFOLK	'Tis like the commons, rude unpolish'd hinds,
2772	Could send such message to their sovereign:
2773	But you, my lord, were glad to be employ'd,
2774	To show how quaint an orator you are:
2775	But all the honour Salisbury hath won
2776	Is, that he was the lord ambassador
2777	Sent from a sort of tinkers to the king.
2778	
2779	Commons	[Within]  An answer from the king, or we will all break in!
2780	
2781	KING HENRY VI	Go, Salisbury, and tell them all from me.
2782	I thank them for their tender loving care;
2783	And had I not been cited so by them,
2784	Yet did I purpose as they do entreat;
2785	For, sure, my thoughts do hourly prophesy
2786	Mischance unto my state by Suffolk's means:
2787	And therefore, by His majesty I swear,
2788	Whose far unworthy deputy I am,
2789	He shall not breathe infection in this air
2790	But three days longer, on the pain of death.
2791	
2792	[Exit SALISBURY]
2793	
2794	QUEEN MARGARET	O Henry, let me plead for gentle Suffolk!
2795	
2796	KING HENRY VI	Ungentle queen, to call him gentle Suffolk!
2797	No more, I say: if thou dost plead for him,
2798	Thou wilt but add increase unto my wrath.
2799	Had I but said, I would have kept my word,
2800	But when I swear, it is irrevocable.
2801	If, after three days' space, thou here be'st found
2802	On any ground that I am ruler of,
2803	The world shall not be ransom for thy life.
2804	Come, Warwick, come, good Warwick, go with me;
2805	I have great matters to impart to thee.
2806	
2807	[Exeunt all but QUEEN MARGARET and SUFFOLK]
2808	
2809	QUEEN MARGARET	Mischance and sorrow go along with you!
2810	Heart's discontent and sour affliction
2811	Be playfellows to keep you company!
2812	There's two of you; the devil make a third!
2813	And threefold vengeance tend upon your steps!
2814	
2815	SUFFOLK	Cease, gentle queen, these execrations,
2816	And let thy Suffolk take his heavy leave.
2817	
2818	QUEEN MARGARET	Fie, coward woman and soft-hearted wretch!
2819	Hast thou not spirit to curse thine enemy?
2820	
2821	SUFFOLK	A plague upon them! wherefore should I curse them?
2822	Would curses kill, as doth the mandrake's groan,
2823	I would invent as bitter-searching terms,
2824	As curst, as harsh and horrible to hear,
2825	Deliver'd strongly through my fixed teeth,
2826	With full as many signs of deadly hate,
2827	As lean-faced Envy in her loathsome cave:
2828	My tongue should stumble in mine earnest words;
2829	Mine eyes should sparkle like the beaten flint;
2830	Mine hair be fixed on end, as one distract;
2831	Ay, every joint should seem to curse and ban:
2832	And even now my burthen'd heart would break,
2833	Should I not curse them. Poison be their drink!
2834	Gall, worse than gall, the daintiest that they taste!
2835	Their sweetest shade a grove of cypress trees!
2836	Their chiefest prospect murdering basilisks!
2837	Their softest touch as smart as lizards' sting!
2838	Their music frightful as the serpent's hiss,
2839	And boding screech-owls make the concert full!
2840	All the foul terrors in dark-seated hell--
2841	
2842	QUEEN MARGARET	Enough, sweet Suffolk; thou torment'st thyself;
2843	And these dread curses, like the sun 'gainst glass,
2844	Or like an overcharged gun, recoil,
2845	And turn the force of them upon thyself.
2846	
2847	SUFFOLK	You bade me ban, and will you bid me leave?
2848	Now, by the ground that I am banish'd from,
2849	Well could I curse away a winter's night,
2850	Though standing naked on a mountain top,
2851	Where biting cold would never let grass grow,
2852	And think it but a minute spent in sport.
2853	
2854	QUEEN MARGARET	O, let me entreat thee cease. Give me thy hand,
2855	That I may dew it with my mournful tears;
2856	Nor let the rain of heaven wet this place,
2857	To wash away my woful monuments.
2858	O, could this kiss be printed in thy hand,
2859	That thou mightst think upon these by the seal,
2860	Through whom a thousand sighs are breathed for thee!
2861	So, get thee gone, that I may know my grief;
2862	'Tis but surmised whiles thou art standing by,
2863	As one that surfeits thinking on a want.
2864	I will repeal thee, or, be well assured,
2865	Adventure to be banished myself:
2866	And banished I am, if but from thee.
2867	Go; speak not to me; even now be gone.
2868	O, go not yet! Even thus two friends condemn'd
2869	Embrace and kiss and take ten thousand leaves,
2870	Loather a hundred times to part than die.
2871	Yet now farewell; and farewell life with thee!
2872	
2873	SUFFOLK	Thus is poor Suffolk ten times banished;
2874	Once by the king, and three times thrice by thee.
2875	'Tis not the land I care for, wert thou thence;
2876	A wilderness is populous enough,
2877	So Suffolk had thy heavenly company:
2878	For where thou art, there is the world itself,
2879	With every several pleasure in the world,
2880	And where thou art not, desolation.
2881	I can no more: live thou to joy thy life;
2882	Myself no joy in nought but that thou livest.
2883	
2884	[Enter VAUX]
2885	
2886	QUEEN MARGARET	Wither goes Vaux so fast? what news, I prithee?
2887	
2888	VAUX	To signify unto his majesty
2889	That Cardinal Beaufort is at point of death;
2890	For suddenly a grievous sickness took him,
2891	That makes him gasp and stare and catch the air,
2892	Blaspheming God and cursing men on earth.
2893	Sometimes he talks as if Duke Humphrey's ghost
2894	Were by his side; sometime he calls the king,
2895	And whispers to his pillow, as to him,
2896	The secrets of his overcharged soul;
2897	And I am sent to tell his majesty
2898	That even now he cries aloud for him.
2899	
2900	QUEEN MARGARET	Go tell this heavy message to the king.
2901	
2902	[Exit VAUX]
2903	
2904	Ay me! what is this world! what news are these!
2905	But wherefore grieve I at an hour's poor loss,
2906	Omitting Suffolk's exile, my soul's treasure?
2907	Why only, Suffolk, mourn I not for thee,
2908	And with the southern clouds contend in tears,
2909	Theirs for the earth's increase, mine for my sorrows?
2910	Now get thee hence: the king, thou know'st, is coming;
2911	If thou be found by me, thou art but dead.
2912	
2913	SUFFOLK	If I depart from thee, I cannot live;
2914	And in thy sight to die, what were it else
2915	But like a pleasant slumber in thy lap?
2916	Here could I breathe my soul into the air,
2917	As mild and gentle as the cradle-babe
2918	Dying with mother's dug between its lips:
2919	Where, from thy sight, I should be raging mad,
2920	And cry out for thee to close up mine eyes,
2921	To have thee with thy lips to stop my mouth;
2922	So shouldst thou either turn my flying soul,
2923	Or I should breathe it so into thy body,
2924	And then it lived in sweet Elysium.
2925	To die by thee were but to die in jest;
2926	From thee to die were torture more than death:
2927	O, let me stay, befall what may befall!
2928	
2929	QUEEN MARGARET	Away! though parting be a fretful corrosive,
2930	It is applied to a deathful wound.
2931	To France, sweet Suffolk: let me hear from thee;
2932	For wheresoe'er thou art in this world's globe,
2933	I'll have an Iris that shall find thee out.
2934	
2935	SUFFOLK	I go.
2936	
2937	QUEEN MARGARET	And take my heart with thee.
2938	
2939	SUFFOLK	A jewel, lock'd into the wofull'st cask
2940	That ever did contain a thing of worth.
2941	Even as a splitted bark, so sunder we
2942	This way fall I to death.
2943	
2944	QUEEN MARGARET	This way for me.

2963	
2964	KING HENRY VI	How fares my lord? speak, Beaufort, to
2965	thy sovereign.
2966	
2967	CARDINAL	If thou be'st death, I'll give thee England's treasure,
2968	Enough to purchase such another island,
2969	So thou wilt let me live, and feel no pain.
2970	
2971	KING HENRY VI	Ah, what a sign it is of evil life,
2972	Where death's approach is seen so terrible!
2973	
2974	WARWICK	Beaufort, it is thy sovereign speaks to thee.
2975	
2976	CARDINAL	Bring me unto my trial when you will.
2977	Died he not in his bed? where should he die?
2978	Can I make men live, whether they will or no?
2979	O, torture me no more! I will confess.
2980	Alive again? then show me where he is:
2981	I'll give a thousand pound to look upon him.
2982	He hath no eyes, the dust hath blinded them.
2983	Comb down his hair; look, look! it stands upright,
2984	Like lime-twigs set to catch my winged soul.
2985	Give me some drink; and bid the apothecary
2986	Bring the strong poison that I bought of him.
2987	
2988	KING HENRY VI	O thou eternal Mover of the heavens.
2989	Look with a gentle eye upon this wretch!
2990	O, beat away the busy meddling fiend
2991	That lays strong siege unto this wretch's soul.
2992	And from his bosom purge this black despair!
2993	
2994	WARWICK	See, how the pangs of death do make him grin!
2995	
2996	SALISBURY	Disturb him not; let him pass peaceably.
2997	
2998	KING HENRY VI	Peace to his soul, if God's good pleasure be!
2999	Lord cardinal, if thou think'st on heaven's bliss,
3000	Hold up thy hand, make signal of thy hope.
3001	He dies, and makes no sign. O God, forgive him!
3002	
3003	WARWICK	So bad a death argues a monstrous life.
3004	
3005	KING HENRY VI	Forbear to judge, for we are sinners all.

3019	
3020	
3021	SCENE I	The coast of Kent.
3022	
3023	
3024	[Alarum. Fight at sea. Ordnance goes off. Enter a
3025	Captain, a Master, a Master's-mate, WALTER WHITMORE,
3026	and others; with them SUFFOLK, and others, prisoners]
3027	
3028	Captain	The gaudy, blabbing and remorseful day
3029	Is crept into the bosom of the sea;
3030	And now loud-howling wolves arouse the jades
3031	That drag the tragic melancholy night;
3032	Who, with their drowsy, slow and flagging wings,
3033	Clip dead men's graves and from their misty jaws
3034	Breathe foul contagious darkness in the air.
3035	Therefore bring forth the soldiers of our prize;
3036	For, whilst our pinnace anchors in the Downs,
3037	Here shall they make their ransom on the sand,
3038	Or with their blood stain this discolour'd shore.
3039	Master, this prisoner freely give I thee;
3040	And thou that art his mate, make boot of this;
3041	The other, Walter Whitmore, is thy share.
3042	
3043	First Gentleman	What is my ransom, master? let me know.
3044	
3045	Master	A thousand crowns, or else lay down your head.
3046	
3047	Master's-Mate	And so much shall you give, or off goes yours.
3048	
3049	Captain	What, think you much to pay two thousand crowns,
3050	And bear the name and port of gentlemen?
3051	Cut both the villains' throats; for die you shall:
3052	The lives of those which we have lost in fight
3053	Be counterpoised with such a petty sum!
3054	
3055	First Gentleman	I'll give it, sir; and therefore spare my life.
3056	
3057	Second Gentleman	And so will I and write home for it straight.
3058	
3059	WHITMORE	I lost mine eye in laying the prize aboard,
3060	And therefore to revenge it, shalt thou die;
3061	
3062	[To SUFFOLK]
3063	
3064	And so should these, if I might have my will.
3065	
3066	Captain	Be not so rash; take ransom, let him live.
3067	
3068	SUFFOLK	Look on my George; I am a gentleman:
3069	Rate me at what thou wilt, thou shalt be paid.
3070	
3071	WHITMORE	And so am I; my name is Walter Whitmore.
3072	How now! why start'st thou? what, doth
3073	death affright?
3074	
3075	SUFFOLK	Thy name affrights me, in whose sound is death.
3076	A cunning man did calculate my birth
3077	And told me that by water I should die:
3078	Yet let not this make thee be bloody-minded;
3079	Thy name is Gaultier, being rightly sounded.
3080	
3081	WHITMORE	Gaultier or Walter, which it is, I care not:
3082	Never yet did base dishonour blur our name,
3083	But with our sword we wiped away the blot;
3084	Therefore, when merchant-like I sell revenge,
3085	Broke be my sword, my arms torn and defaced,
3086	And I proclaim'd a coward through the world!
3087	
3088	SUFFOLK	Stay, Whitmore; for thy prisoner is a prince,
3089	The Duke of Suffolk, William de la Pole.
3090	
3091	WHITMORE	The Duke of Suffolk muffled up in rags!
3092	
3093	SUFFOLK	Ay, but these rags are no part of the duke:
3094	Jove sometimes went disguised, and why not I?
3095	
3096	Captain	But Jove was never slain, as thou shalt be.
3097	
3098	SUFFOLK	Obscure and lowly swain, King Henry's blood,
3099	The honourable blood of Lancaster,
3100	Must not be shed by such a jaded groom.
3101	Hast thou not kiss'd thy hand and held my stirrup?
3102	Bare-headed plodded by my foot-cloth mule
3103	And thought thee happy when I shook my head?
3104	How often hast thou waited at my cup,
3105	Fed from my trencher, kneel'd down at the board.
3106	When I have feasted with Queen Margaret?
3107	Remember it and let it make thee crest-fall'n,
3108	Ay, and allay this thy abortive pride;
3109	How in our voiding lobby hast thou stood
3110	And duly waited for my coming forth?
3111	This hand of mine hath writ in thy behalf,
3112	And therefore shall it charm thy riotous tongue.
3113	
3114	WHITMORE	Speak, captain, shall I stab the forlorn swain?
3115	
3116	Captain	First let my words stab him, as he hath me.
3117	
3118	SUFFOLK	Base slave, thy words are blunt and so art thou.
3119	
3120	Captain	Convey him hence and on our longboat's side
3121	Strike off his head.
3122	
3123	SUFFOLK	Thou darest not, for thy own.
3124	
3125	Captain	Yes, Pole.
3126	
3127	SUFFOLK	       Pole!
3128	
3129	Captain	         Pool! Sir Pool! lord!
3130	Ay, kennel, puddle, sink; whose filth and dirt
3131	Troubles the silver spring where England drinks.
3132	Now will I dam up this thy yawning mouth
3133	For swallowing the treasure of the realm:
3134	Thy lips that kiss'd the queen shall sweep the ground;
3135	And thou that smiledst at good Duke Humphrey's death,
3136	Against the senseless winds shalt grin in vain,
3137	Who in contempt shall hiss at thee again:
3138	And wedded be thou to the hags of hell,
3139	For daring to affy a mighty lord
3140	Unto the daughter of a worthless king,
3141	Having neither subject, wealth, nor diadem.
3142	By devilish policy art thou grown great,
3143	And, like ambitious Sylla, overgorged
3144	With gobbets of thy mother's bleeding heart.
3145	By thee Anjou and Maine were sold to France,
3146	The false revolting Normans thorough thee
3147	Disdain to call us lord, and Picardy
3148	Hath slain their governors, surprised our forts,
3149	And sent the ragged soldiers wounded home.
3150	The princely Warwick, and the Nevils all,
3151	Whose dreadful swords were never drawn in vain,
3152	As hating thee, are rising up in arms:
3153	And now the house of York, thrust from the crown
3154	By shameful murder of a guiltless king
3155	And lofty proud encroaching tyranny,
3156	Burns with revenging fire; whose hopeful colours
3157	Advance our half-faced sun, striving to shine,
3158	Under the which is writ 'Invitis nubibus.'
3159	The commons here in Kent are up in arms:
3160	And, to conclude, reproach and beggary
3161	Is crept into the palace of our king.
3162	And all by thee. Away! convey him hence.
3163	
3164	SUFFOLK	O that I were a god, to shoot forth thunder
3165	Upon these paltry, servile, abject drudges!
3166	Small things make base men proud: this villain here,
3167	Being captain of a pinnace, threatens more
3168	Than Bargulus the strong Illyrian pirate.
3169	Drones suck not eagles' blood but rob beehives:
3170	It is impossible that I should die
3171	By such a lowly vassal as thyself.
3172	Thy words move rage and not remorse in me:
3173	I go of message from the queen to France;
3174	I charge thee waft me safely cross the Channel.
3175	
3176	Captain	Walter,--
3177	
3178	WHITMORE	Come, Suffolk, I must waft thee to thy death.
3179	
3180	SUFFOLK	Gelidus timor occupat artus it is thee I fear.
3181	
3182	WHITMORE	Thou shalt have cause to fear before I leave thee.
3183	What, are ye daunted now? now will ye stoop?
3184	
3185	First Gentleman	My gracious lord, entreat him, speak him fair.
3186	
3187	SUFFOLK	Suffolk's imperial tongue is stern and rough,
3188	Used to command, untaught to plead for favour.
3189	Far be it we should honour such as these
3190	With humble suit: no, rather let my head
3191	Stoop to the block than these knees bow to any
3192	Save to the God of heaven and to my king;
3193	And sooner dance upon a bloody pole
3194	Than stand uncover'd to the vulgar groom.
3195	True nobility is exempt from fear:
3196	More can I bear than you dare execute.
3197	
3198	Captain	Hale him away, and let him talk no more.
3199	
3200	SUFFOLK	Come, soldiers, show what cruelty ye can,
3201	That this my death may never be forgot!
3202	Great men oft die by vile bezonians:
3203	A Roman sworder and banditto slave
3204	Murder'd sweet Tully; Brutus' bastard hand
3205	Stabb'd Julius Caesar; savage islanders
3206	Pompey the Great; and Suffolk dies by pirates.
3207	
3208	[Exeunt Whitmore and others with Suffolk]
3209	
3210	Captain	And as for these whose ransom we have set,
3211	It is our pleasure one of them depart;
3212	Therefore come you with us and let him go.
3213	
3214	[Exeunt all but the First Gentleman]
3215	
3216	[Re-enter WHITMORE with SUFFOLK's body]
3217	
3218	WHITMORE	There let his head and lifeless body lie,
3219	Until the queen his mistress bury it.
3220	
3221	[Exit]
3222	
3223	First Gentleman	O barbarous and bloody spectacle!
3224	His body will I bear unto the king:
3225	If he revenge it not, yet will his friends;
3226	So will the queen, that living held him dear.
3227	
3228	[Exit with the body]

3234	
3235	
3236	ACT IV
3237	
3238	
3239	
3240	SCENE II	Blackheath.
3241	
3242	
3243	[Enter GEORGE BEVIS and JOHN HOLLAND]
3244	
3245	BEVIS	Come, and get thee a sword, though made of a lath;
3246	they have been up these two days.
3247	
3248	HOLLAND	They have the more need to sleep now, then.
3249	
3250	BEVIS	I tell thee, Jack Cade the clothier means to dress
3251	the commonwealth, and turn it, and set a new nap upon it.
3252	
3253	HOLLAND	So he had need, for 'tis threadbare. Well, I say it
3254	was never merry world in England since gentlemen came up.
3255	
3256	BEVIS	O miserable age! virtue is not regarded in handicrafts-men.
3257	
3258	HOLLAND	The nobility think scorn to go in leather aprons.
3259	
3260	BEVIS	Nay, more, the king's council are no good workmen.
3261	
3262	HOLLAND	True; and yet it is said, labour in thy vocation;
3263	which is as much to say as, let the magistrates be
3264	labouring men; and therefore should we be
3265	magistrates.
3266	
3267	BEVIS	Thou hast hit it; for there's no better sign of a
3268	brave mind than a hard hand.
3269	
3270	HOLLAND	I see them! I see them! there's Best's son, the
3271	tanner of Wingham,--
3272	
3273	BEVIS	He shall have the skin of our enemies, to make
3274	dog's-leather of.
3275	
3276	HOLLAND	And Dick the Butcher,--
3277	
3278	BEVIS	Then is sin struck down like an ox, and iniquity's
3279	throat cut like a calf.
3280	
3281	HOLLAND	And Smith the weaver,--
3282	
3283	BEVIS	Argo, their thread of life is spun.
3284	
3285	HOLLAND	Come, come, let's fall in with them.
3286	
3287	[Drum. Enter CADE, DICK the Butcher, SMITH the
3288	Weaver, and a Sawyer, with infinite numbers]
3289	
3290	CADE	We John Cade, so termed of our supposed father,--
3291	
3292	DICK	[Aside]  Or rather, of stealing a cade of herrings.
3293	
3294	CADE	For our enemies shall fall before us, inspired with
3295	the spirit of putting down kings and princes,
3296	--Command silence.
3297	
3298	DICK	Silence!
3299	
3300	CADE	My father was a Mortimer,--
3301	
3302	DICK	[Aside]  He was an honest man, and a good
3303	bricklayer.
3304	
3305	CADE	My mother a Plantagenet,--
3306	
3307	DICK	[Aside]  I knew her well; she was a midwife.
3308	
3309	CADE	My wife descended of the Lacies,--
3310	
3311	DICK	[Aside]  She was, indeed, a pedler's daughter, and
3312	sold many laces.
3313	
3314	SMITH	[Aside]  But now of late, notable to travel with her
3315	furred pack, she washes bucks here at home.
3316	
3317	CADE	Therefore am I of an honourable house.
3318	
3319	DICK	[Aside]  Ay, by my faith, the field is honourable;
3320	and there was he borne, under a hedge, for his
3321	father had never a house but the cage.
3322	
3323	CADE	Valiant I am.
3324	
3325	SMITH	[Aside]  A' must needs; for beggary is valiant.
3326	
3327	CADE	I am able to endure much.
3328	
3329	DICK	[Aside]  No question of that; for I have seen him
3330	whipped three market-days together.
3331	
3332	CADE	I fear neither sword nor fire.
3333	
3334	SMITH	[Aside]  He need not fear the sword; for his coat is of proof.
3335	
3336	DICK	[Aside]  But methinks he should stand in fear of
3337	fire, being burnt i' the hand for stealing of sheep.
3338	
3339	CADE	Be brave, then; for your captain is brave, and vows
3340	reformation. There shall be in England seven
3341	halfpenny loaves sold for a penny: the three-hooped
3342	pot; shall have ten hoops and I will make it felony
3343	to drink small beer: all the realm shall be in
3344	common; and in Cheapside shall my palfrey go to
3345	grass: and when I am king, as king I will be,--
3346	
3347	ALL	God save your majesty!
3348	
3349	CADE	I thank you, good people: there shall be no money;
3350	all shall eat and drink on my score; and I will
3351	apparel them all in one livery, that they may agree
3352	like brothers and worship me their lord.
3353	
3354	DICK	The first thing we do, let's kill all the lawyers.
3355	
3356	CADE	Nay, that I mean to do. Is not this a lamentable
3357	thing, that of the skin of an innocent lamb should
3358	be made parchment? that parchment, being scribbled
3359	o'er, should undo a man? Some say the bee stings:
3360	but I say, 'tis the bee's wax; for I did but seal
3361	once to a thing, and I was never mine own man
3362	since. How now! who's there?
3363	
3364	[Enter some, bringing forward the Clerk of Chatham]
3365	
3366	SMITH	The clerk of Chatham: he can write and read and
3367	cast accompt.
3368	
3369	CADE	O monstrous!
3370	
3371	SMITH	We took him setting of boys' copies.
3372	
3373	CADE	Here's a villain!
3374	
3375	SMITH	Has a book in his pocket with red letters in't.
3376	
3377	CADE	Nay, then, he is a conjurer.
3378	
3379	DICK	Nay, he can make obligations, and write court-hand.
3380	
3381	CADE	I am sorry for't: the man is a proper man, of mine
3382	honour; unless I find him guilty, he shall not die.
3383	Come hither, sirrah, I must examine thee: what is thy name?
3384	
3385	Clerk	Emmanuel.
3386	
3387	DICK	They use to write it on the top of letters: 'twill
3388	go hard with you.
3389	
3390	CADE	Let me alone. Dost thou use to write thy name? or
3391	hast thou a mark to thyself, like an honest
3392	plain-dealing man?
3393	
3394	CLERK	Sir, I thank God, I have been so well brought up
3395	that I can write my name.
3396	
3397	ALL	He hath confessed: away with him! he's a villain
3398	and a traitor.
3399	
3400	CADE	Away with him, I say! hang him with his pen and
3401	ink-horn about his neck.
3402	
3403	[Exit one with the Clerk]
3404	
3405	[Enter MICHAEL]
3406	
3407	MICHAEL	Where's our general?
3408	
3409	CADE	Here I am, thou particular fellow.
3410	
3411	MICHAEL	Fly, fly, fly! Sir Humphrey Stafford and his
3412	brother are hard by, with the king's forces.
3413	
3414	CADE	Stand, villain, stand, or I'll fell thee down. He
3415	shall be encountered with a man as good as himself:
3416	he is but a knight, is a'?
3417	
3418	MICHAEL	No.
3419	
3420	CADE	To equal him, I will make myself a knight presently.
3421	
3422	[Kneels]
3423	
3424	Rise up Sir John Mortimer.
3425	
3426	[Rises]
3427	
3428	Now have at him!
3429	
3430	[Enter SIR HUMPHREY and WILLIAM STAFFORD, with
3431	drum and soldiers]
3432	
3433	SIR HUMPHREY	Rebellious hinds, the filth and scum of Kent,
3434	Mark'd for the gallows, lay your weapons down;
3435	Home to your cottages, forsake this groom:
3436	The king is merciful, if you revolt.
3437	
3438	WILLIAM STAFFORD	But angry, wrathful, and inclined to blood,
3439	If you go forward; therefore yield, or die.
3440	
3441	CADE	As for these silken-coated slaves, I pass not:
3442	It is to you, good people, that I speak,
3443	Over whom, in time to come, I hope to reign;
3444	For I am rightful heir unto the crown.
3445	
3446	SIR HUMPHREY	Villain, thy father was a plasterer;
3447	And thou thyself a shearman, art thou not?
3448	
3449	CADE	And Adam was a gardener.
3450	
3451	WILLIAM STAFFORD	And what of that?
3452	
3453	CADE	Marry, this: Edmund Mortimer, Earl of March.
3454	Married the Duke of Clarence' daughter, did he not?
3455	
3456	SIR HUMPHREY	Ay, sir.
3457	
3458	CADE	By her he had two children at one birth.
3459	
3460	WILLIAM STAFFORD	That's false.
3461	
3462	CADE	Ay, there's the question; but I say, 'tis true:
3463	The elder of them, being put to nurse,
3464	Was by a beggar-woman stolen away;
3465	And, ignorant of his birth and parentage,
3466	Became a bricklayer when he came to age:
3467	His son am I; deny it, if you can.
3468	
3469	DICK	Nay, 'tis too true; therefore he shall be king.
3470	
3471	SMITH	Sir, he made a chimney in my father's house, and
3472	the bricks are alive at this day to testify it;
3473	therefore deny it not.
3474	
3475	SIR HUMPHREY	And will you credit this base drudge's words,
3476	That speaks he knows not what?
3477	
3478	ALL	Ay, marry, will we; therefore get ye gone.
3479	
3480	WILLIAM STAFFORD	Jack Cade, the Duke of York hath taught you this.
3481	
3482	CADE	[Aside]  He lies, for I invented it myself.
3483	Go to, sirrah, tell the king from me, that, for his
3484	father's sake, Henry the Fifth, in whose time boys
3485	went to span-counter for French crowns, I am content
3486	he shall reign; but I'll be protector over him.
3487	
3488	DICK	And furthermore, well have the Lord Say's head for
3489	selling the dukedom of Maine.
3490	
3491	CADE	And good reason; for thereby is England mained, and
3492	fain to go with a staff, but that my puissance holds
3493	it up. Fellow kings, I tell you that that Lord Say
3494	hath gelded the commonwealth, and made it an eunuch:
3495	and more than that, he can speak French; and
3496	therefore he is a traitor.
3497	
3498	SIR HUMPHREY	O gross and miserable ignorance!
3499	
3500	CADE	Nay, answer, if you can: the Frenchmen are our
3501	enemies; go to, then, I ask but this: can he that
3502	speaks with the tongue of an enemy be a good
3503	counsellor, or no?
3504	
3505	ALL	No, no; and therefore we'll have his head.
3506	
3507	WILLIAM STAFFORD	Well, seeing gentle words will not prevail,
3508	Assail them with the army of the king.
3509	
3510	SIR HUMPHREY	Herald, away; and throughout every town
3511	Proclaim them traitors that are up with Cade;
3512	That those which fly before the battle ends
3513	May, even in their wives' and children's sight,
3514	Be hang'd up for example at their doors:
3515	And you that be the king's friends, follow me.
3516	
3517	[Exeunt WILLIAM STAFFORD and SIR HUMPHREY, and soldiers]
3518	
3519	CADE	And you that love the commons, follow me.
3520	Now show yourselves men; 'tis for liberty.
3521	We will not leave one lord, one gentleman:
3522	Spare none but such as go in clouted shoon;
3523	For they are thrifty honest men, and such
3524	As would, but that they dare not, take our parts.
3525	
3526	DICK	They are all in order and march toward us.
3527	
3528	CADE	But then are we in order when we are most
3529	out of order. Come, march forward.

3547	WILLIAM STAFFORD are slain. Enter CADE and the rest]
3548	
3549	CADE	Where's Dick, the butcher of Ashford?
3550	
3551	DICK	Here, sir.
3552	
3553	CADE	They fell before thee like sheep and oxen, and thou
3554	behavedst thyself as if thou hadst been in thine own
3555	slaughter-house: therefore thus will I reward thee,
3556	the Lent shall be as long again as it is; and thou
3557	shalt have a licence to kill for a hundred lacking
3558	one.
3559	
3560	DICK	I desire no more.
3561	
3562	CADE	And, to speak truth, thou deservest no less. This
3563	monument of the victory will I bear;
3564	
3565	[Putting on SIR HUMPHREY'S brigandine]
3566	
3567	and the bodies shall be dragged at my horse' heels
3568	till I do come to London, where we will have the
3569	mayor's sword borne before us.
3570	
3571	DICK	If we mean to thrive and do good, break open the
3572	gaols and let out the prisoners.
3573	
3574	CADE	Fear not that, I warrant thee. Come, let's march
3575	towards London.

3591	
3592	[Enter KING HENRY VI with a supplication, and the
3593	QUEEN with SUFFOLK'S head, BUCKINGHAM and Lord SAY]
3594	
3595	QUEEN MARGARET	Oft have I heard that grief softens the mind,
3596	And makes it fearful and degenerate;
3597	Think therefore on revenge and cease to weep.
3598	But who can cease to weep and look on this?
3599	Here may his head lie on my throbbing breast:
3600	But where's the body that I should embrace?
3601	
3602	BUCKINGHAM	What answer makes your grace to the rebels'
3603	supplication?
3604	
3605	KING HENRY VI	I'll send some holy bishop to entreat;
3606	For God forbid so many simple souls
3607	Should perish by the sword! And I myself,
3608	Rather than bloody war shall cut them short,
3609	Will parley with Jack Cade their general:
3610	But stay, I'll read it over once again.
3611	
3612	QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, barbarous villains! hath this lovely face
3613	Ruled, like a wandering planet, over me,
3614	And could it not enforce them to relent,
3615	That were unworthy to behold the same?
3616	
3617	KING HENRY VI	Lord Say, Jack Cade hath sworn to have thy head.
3618	
3619	SAY	Ay, but I hope your highness shall have his.
3620	
3621	KING HENRY VI	How now, madam!
3622	Still lamenting and mourning for Suffolk's death?
3623	I fear me, love, if that I had been dead,
3624	Thou wouldst not have mourn'd so much for me.
3625	
3626	QUEEN MARGARET	No, my love, I should not mourn, but die for thee.
3627	
3628	[Enter a Messenger]
3629	
3630	KING HENRY VI	How now! what news? why comest thou in such haste?
3631	
3632	Messenger	The rebels are in Southwark; fly, my lord!
3633	Jack Cade proclaims himself Lord Mortimer,
3634	Descended from the Duke of Clarence' house,
3635	And calls your grace usurper openly
3636	And vows to crown himself in Westminster.
3637	His army is a ragged multitude
3638	Of hinds and peasants, rude and merciless:
3639	Sir Humphrey Stafford and his brother's death
3640	Hath given them heart and courage to proceed:
3641	All scholars, lawyers, courtiers, gentlemen,
3642	They call false caterpillars, and intend their death.
3643	
3644	KING HENRY VI	O graceless men! they know not what they do.
3645	
3646	BUCKINGHAM	My gracious lord, return to Killingworth,
3647	Until a power be raised to put them down.
3648	
3649	QUEEN MARGARET	Ah, were the Duke of Suffolk now alive,
3650	These Kentish rebels would be soon appeased!
3651	
3652	KING HENRY VI	Lord Say, the traitors hate thee;
3653	Therefore away with us to Killingworth.
3654	
3655	SAY	So might your grace's person be in danger.

3666	To spoil the city and your royal court.

3700	
3701	First Citizen	No, my lord, nor likely to be slain; for they have
3702	won the bridge, killing all those that withstand
3703	them: the lord mayor craves aid of your honour from
3704	the Tower, to defend the city from the rebels.
3705

3805	pound, the last subsidy.
3806	
3807	[Enter BEVIS, with Lord SAY]
3808	
3809	CADE	Well, he shall be beheaded for it ten times. Ah,
3810	thou say, thou serge, nay, thou buckram lord! now
3811	art thou within point-blank of our jurisdiction
3812	regal. What canst thou answer to my majesty for
3813	giving up of Normandy unto Mounsieur Basimecu, the
3814	dauphin of France? Be it known unto thee by these
3815	presence, even the presence of Lord Mortimer, that I
3816	am the besom that must sweep the court clean of such
3817	filth as thou art. Thou hast most traitorously
3818	corrupted the youth of the realm in erecting a
3819	grammar school; and whereas, before, our forefathers
3820	had no other books but the score and the tally, thou
3821	hast caused printing to be used, and, contrary to
3822	the king, his crown and dignity, thou hast built a
3823	paper-mill. It will be proved to thy face that thou
3824	hast men about thee that usually talk of a noun and
3825	a verb, and such abominable words as no Christian
3826	ear can endure to hear. Thou hast appointed
3827	justices of peace, to call poor men before them
3828	about matters they were not able to answer.
3829	Moreover, thou hast put them in prison; and because
3830	they could not read, thou hast hanged them; when,
3831	indeed, only for that cause they have been most
3832	worthy to live. Thou dost ride in a foot-cloth, dost thou not?
3833	
3834	SAY	What of that?
3835	
3836	CADE	Marry, thou oughtest not to let thy horse wear a
3837	cloak, when honester men than thou go in their hose
3838	and doublets.
3839	
3840	DICK	And work in their shirt too; as myself, for example,
3841	that am a butcher.
3842	
3843	SAY	You men of Kent,--
3844	
3845	DICK	What say you of Kent?
3846	
3847	SAY	Nothing but this; 'tis 'bona terra, mala gens.'
3848	
3849	CADE	Away with him, away with him! he speaks Latin.
3850	
3851	SAY	Hear me but speak, and bear me where you will.
3852	Kent, in the Commentaries Caesar writ,
3853	Is term'd the civil'st place of this isle:
3854	Sweet is the country, because full of riches;
3855	The people liberal, valiant, active, wealthy;
3856	Which makes me hope you are not void of pity.
3857	I sold not Maine, I lost not Normandy,
3858	Yet, to recover them, would lose my life.
3859	Justice with favour have I always done;
3860	Prayers and tears have moved me, gifts could never.
3861	When have I aught exacted at your hands,
3862	But to maintain the king, the realm and you?
3863	Large gifts have I bestow'd on learned clerks,
3864	Because my book preferr'd me to the king,
3865	And seeing ignorance is the curse of God,
3866	Knowledge the wing wherewith we fly to heaven,
3867	Unless you be possess'd with devilish spirits,
3868	You cannot but forbear to murder me:
3869	This tongue hath parley'd unto foreign kings
3870	For your behoof,--
3871	
3872	CADE	Tut, when struck'st thou one blow in the field?
3873	
3874	SAY	Great men have reaching hands: oft have I struck
3875	Those that I never saw and struck them dead.
3876	
3877	BEVIS	O monstrous coward! what, to come behind folks?
3878	
3879	SAY	These cheeks are pale for watching for your good.
3880	
3881	CADE	Give him a box o' the ear and that will make 'em red again.
3882	
3883	SAY	Long sitting to determine poor men's causes
3884	Hath made me full of sickness and diseases.
3885	
3886	CADE	Ye shall have a hempen caudle, then, and the help of hatchet.
3887	
3888	DICK	Why dost thou quiver, man?
3889	
3890	SAY	The palsy, and not fear, provokes me.
3891	
3892	CADE	Nay, he nods at us, as who should say, I'll be even
3893	with you: I'll see if his head will stand steadier
3894	on a pole, or no. Take him away, and behead him.
3895	
3896	SAY	Tell me wherein have I offended most?
3897	Have I affected wealth or honour? speak.
3898	Are my chests fill'd up with extorted gold?
3899	Is my apparel sumptuous to behold?
3900	Whom have I injured, that ye seek my death?
3901	These hands are free from guiltless bloodshedding,
3902	This breast from harbouring foul deceitful thoughts.
3903	O, let me live!
3904	
3905	CADE	[Aside]  I feel remorse in myself with his words;
3906	but I'll bridle it: he shall die, an it be but for
3907	pleading so well for his life. Away with him! he
3908	has a familiar under his tongue; he speaks not o'
3909	God's name. Go, take him away, I say, and strike
3910	off his head presently; and then break into his
3911	son-in-law's house, Sir James Cromer, and strike off
3912	his head, and bring them both upon two poles hither.
3913	
3914	ALL	It shall be done.
3915	
3916	SAY	Ah, countrymen! if when you make your prayers,
3917	God should be so obdurate as yourselves,
3918	How would it fare with your departed souls?
3919	And therefore yet relent, and save my life.
3920

3944	some more towns in France. Soldiers, defer the
3945	spoil of the city until night: for with these borne
3946	before us, instead of maces, will we ride through

4112	Is marching hitherward in proud array,
4113	And still proclaimeth, as he comes along,
4114	His arms are only to remove from thee
4115	The Duke of Somerset, whom he terms traitor.
4116	
4117	KING HENRY VI	Thus stands my state, 'twixt Cade and York distress'd.

4123	And ask him what's the reason of these arms.
4124	Tell him I'll send Duke Edmund to the Tower;

4164	on a brick wall have I climbed into this garden, to
4165	see if I can eat grass, or pick a sallet another
4166	while, which is not amiss to cool a man's stomach

4169	sallet, my brainpan had been cleft with a brown
4170	bill; and many a time, when I have been dry and

4191	my sword like a great pin, ere thou and I part.
4192	
4193	IDEN	Why, rude companion, whatsoe'er thou be,
4194	I know thee not; why, then, should I betray thee?
4195	Is't not enough to break into my garden,
4196	And, like a thief, to come to rob my grounds,
4197	Climbing my walls in spite of me the owner,
4198	But thou wilt brave me with these saucy terms?
4199	
4200	CADE	Brave thee! ay, by the best blood that ever was
4201	broached, and beard thee too. Look on me well: I
4202	have eat no meat these five days; yet, come thou and
4203	thy five men, and if I do not leave you all as dead
4204	as a doornail, I pray God I may never eat grass more.
4205	
4206	IDEN	Nay, it shall ne'er be said, while England stands,
4207	That Alexander Iden, an esquire of Kent,
4208	Took odds to combat a poor famish'd man.
4209	Oppose thy steadfast-gazing eyes to mine,
4210	See if thou canst outface me with thy looks:
4211	Set limb to limb, and thou art far the lesser;
4212	Thy hand is but a finger to my fist,
4213	Thy leg a stick compared with this truncheon;
4214	My foot shall fight with all the strength thou hast;
4215	And if mine arm be heaved in the air,
4216	Thy grave is digg'd already in the earth.
4217	As for words, whose greatness answers words,
4218	Let this my sword report what speech forbears.
4219	
4220	CADE	By my valour, the most complete champion that ever I
4221	heard! Steel, if thou turn the edge, or cut not out
4222	the burly-boned clown in chines of beef ere thou
4223	sleep in thy sheath, I beseech God on my knees thou
4224	mayst be turned to hobnails.
4225	
4226	[Here they fight. CADE falls]
4227	
4228	O, I am slain! famine and no other hath slain me:
4229	let ten thousand devils come against me, and give me
4230	but the ten meals I have lost, and I'll defy them
4231	all. Wither, garden; and be henceforth a
4232	burying-place to all that do dwell in this house,
4233	because the unconquered soul of Cade is fled.
4234	
4235	IDEN	Is't Cade that I have slain, that monstrous traitor?
4236	Sword, I will hollow thee for this thy deed,
4237	And hang thee o'er my tomb when I am dead:
4238	Ne'er shall this blood be wiped from thy point;
4239	But thou shalt wear it as a herald's coat,
4240	To emblaze the honour that thy master got.
4241	
4242	CADE	Iden, farewell, and be proud of thy victory. Tell
4243	Kent from me, she hath lost her best man, and exhort
4244	all the world to be cowards; for I, that never
4245	feared any, am vanquished by famine, not by valour.
4246	
4247	[Dies]
4248	
4249	IDEN	How much thou wrong'st me, heaven be my judge.
4250	Die, damned wretch, the curse of her that bare thee;
4251	And as I thrust thy body in with my sword,
4252	So wish I, I might thrust thy soul to hell.
4253	Hence will I drag thee headlong by the heels
4254	Unto a dunghill which shall be thy grave,
4255	And there cut off thy most ungracious head;
4256	Which I will bear in triumph to the king,
4257	Leaving thy trunk for crows to feed upon.
4258

4264	2 KING HENRY VI
4265	
4266	
4267	ACT V
4268	
4269	
4270	
4271	SCENE I	Fields between Dartford and Blackheath.
4272	
4273	
4274	[Enter YORK, and his army of Irish, with drum
4275	and colours]
4276	
4277	YORK	From Ireland thus comes York to claim his right,
4278	And pluck the crown from feeble Henry's head:
4279	Ring, bells, aloud; burn, bonfires, clear and bright,
4280	To entertain great England's lawful king.
4281	Ah! sancta majestas, who would not buy thee dear?
4282	Let them obey that know not how to rule;
4283	This hand was made to handle naught but gold.
4284	I cannot give due action to my words,
4285	Except a sword or sceptre balance it:
4286	A sceptre shall it have, have I a soul,
4287	On which I'll toss the flower-de-luce of France.
4288	
4289	[Enter BUCKINGHAM]
4290	
4291	Whom have we here? Buckingham, to disturb me?
4292	The king hath sent him, sure: I must dissemble.
4293	
4294	BUCKINGHAM	York, if thou meanest well, I greet thee well.
4295	
4296	YORK	Humphrey of Buckingham, I accept thy greeting.
4297	Art thou a messenger, or come of pleasure?
4298	
4299	BUCKINGHAM	A messenger from Henry, our dread liege,
4300	To know the reason of these arms in peace;
4301	Or why thou, being a subject as I am,
4302	Against thy oath and true allegiance sworn,
4303	Should raise so great a power without his leave,
4304	Or dare to bring thy force so near the court.
4305	
4306	YORK	[Aside]  Scarce can I speak, my choler is so great:
4307	O, I could hew up rocks and fight with flint,
4308	I am so angry at these abject terms;
4309	And now, like Ajax Telamonius,
4310	On sheep or oxen could I spend my fury.
4311	I am far better born than is the king,
4312	More like a king, more kingly in my thoughts:
4313	But I must make fair weather yet a while,
4314	Till Henry be more weak and I more strong,--
4315	Buckingham, I prithee, pardon me,
4316	That I have given no answer all this while;
4317	My mind was troubled with deep melancholy.
4318	The cause why I have brought this army hither
4319	Is to remove proud Somerset from the king,
4320	Seditious to his grace and to the state.
4321	
4322	BUCKINGHAM	That is too much presumption on thy part:
4323	But if thy arms be to no other end,
4324	The king hath yielded unto thy demand:
4325	The Duke of Somerset is in the Tower.
4326	
4327	YORK	Upon thine honour, is he prisoner?
4328	
4329	BUCKINGHAM	Upon mine honour, he is prisoner.
4330	
4331	YORK	Then, Buckingham, I do dismiss my powers.
4332	Soldiers, I thank you all; disperse yourselves;
4333	Meet me to-morrow in St. George's field,
4334	You shall have pay and every thing you wish.
4335	And let my sovereign, virtuous Henry,
4336	Command my eldest son, nay, all my sons,
4337	As pledges of my fealty and love;
4338	I'll send them all as willing as I live:
4339	Lands, goods, horse, armour, any thing I have,
4340	Is his to use, so Somerset may die.
4341	
4342	BUCKINGHAM	York, I commend this kind submission:
4343	We twain will go into his highness' tent.
4344	
4345	[Enter KING HENRY VI and Attendants]
4346	
4347	KING HENRY VI	Buckingham, doth York intend no harm to us,
4348	That thus he marcheth with thee arm in arm?
4349	
4350	YORK	In all submission and humility
4351	York doth present himself unto your highness.
4352	
4353	KING HENRY VI	Then what intends these forces thou dost bring?
4354	
4355	YORK	To heave the traitor Somerset from hence,
4356	And fight against that monstrous rebel Cade,
4357	Who since I heard to be discomfited.
4358	
4359	[Enter IDEN, with CADE'S head]
4360	
4361	IDEN	If one so rude and of so mean condition
4362	May pass into the presence of a king,
4363	Lo, I present your grace a traitor's head,
4364	The head of Cade, whom I in combat slew.
4365	
4366	KING HENRY VI	The head of Cade! Great God, how just art Thou!
4367	O, let me view his visage, being dead,
4368	That living wrought me such exceeding trouble.
4369	Tell me, my friend, art thou the man that slew him?
4370	
4371	IDEN	I was, an't like your majesty.
4372	
4373	KING HENRY VI	How art thou call'd? and what is thy degree?
4374	
4375	IDEN	Alexander Iden, that's my name;
4376	A poor esquire of Kent, that loves his king.
4377	
4378	BUCKINGHAM	So please it you, my lord, 'twere not amiss
4379	He were created knight for his good service.
4380	
4381	KING HENRY VI	Iden, kneel down.
4382	
4383	[He kneels]
4384	
4385	Rise up a knight.
4386	We give thee for reward a thousand marks,
4387	And will that thou henceforth attend on us.
4388	
4389	IDEN	May Iden live to merit such a bounty.
4390	And never live but true unto his liege!
4391	
4392	[Rises]
4393	
4394	[Enter QUEEN MARGARET and SOMERSET]
4395	
4396	KING HENRY VI	See, Buckingham, Somerset comes with the queen:
4397	Go, bid her hide him quickly from the duke.
4398	
4399	QUEEN MARGARET	For thousand Yorks he shall not hide his head,
4400	But boldly stand and front him to his face.
4401	
4402	YORK	How now! is Somerset at liberty?
4403	Then, York, unloose thy long-imprison'd thoughts,
4404	And let thy tongue be equal with thy heart.
4405	Shall I endure the sight of Somerset?
4406	False king! why hast thou broken faith with me,
4407	Knowing how hardly I can brook abuse?
4408	King did I call thee? no, thou art not king,
4409	Not fit to govern and rule multitudes,
4410	Which darest not, no, nor canst not rule a traitor.
4411	That head of thine doth not become a crown;
4412	Thy hand is made to grasp a palmer's staff,
4413	And not to grace an awful princely sceptre.
4414	That gold must round engirt these brows of mine,
4415	Whose smile and frown, like to Achilles' spear,
4416	Is able with the change to kill and cure.
4417	Here is a hand to hold a sceptre up
4418	And with the same to act controlling laws.
4419	Give place: by heaven, thou shalt rule no more
4420	O'er him whom heaven created for thy ruler.
4421	
4422	SOMERSET	O monstrous traitor! I arrest thee, York,
4423	Of capital treason 'gainst the king and crown;
4424	Obey, audacious traitor; kneel for grace.
4425	
4426	YORK	Wouldst have me kneel? first let me ask of these,
4427	If they can brook I bow a knee to man.
4428	Sirrah, call in my sons to be my bail;
4429	
4430	[Exit Attendant]
4431	
4432	I know, ere they will have me go to ward,
4433	They'll pawn their swords for my enfranchisement.
4434	
4435	QUEEN MARGARET	Call hither Clifford! bid him come amain,
4436	To say if that the bastard boys of York
4437	Shall be the surety for their traitor father.
4438	
4439	[Exit BUCKINGHAM]
4440	
4441	YORK	O blood-besotted Neapolitan,
4442	Outcast of Naples, England's bloody scourge!
4443	The sons of York, thy betters in their birth,
4444	Shall be their father's bail; and bane to those
4445	That for my surety will refuse the boys!
4446	
4447	[Enter EDWARD and RICHARD]
4448	
4449	See where they come: I'll warrant they'll
4450	make it good.
4451	
4452	[Enter CLIFFORD and YOUNG CLIFFORD]
4453	
4454	QUEEN MARGARET	And here comes Clifford to deny their bail.
4455	
4456	CLIFFORD	Health and all happiness to my lord the king!
4457	
4458	[Kneels]
4459	
4460	YORK	I thank thee, Clifford: say, what news with thee?
4461	Nay, do not fright us with an angry look;
4462	We are thy sovereign, Clifford, kneel again;
4463	For thy mistaking so, we pardon thee.
4464	
4465	CLIFFORD	This is my king, York, I do not mistake;
4466	But thou mistakest me much to think I do:
4467	To Bedlam with him! is the man grown mad?
4468	
4469	KING HENRY VI	Ay, Clifford; a bedlam and ambitious humour
4470	Makes him oppose himself against his king.
4471	
4472	CLIFFORD	He is a traitor; let him to the Tower,
4473	And chop away that factious pate of his.
4474	
4475	QUEEN MARGARET	He is arrested, but will not obey;
4476	His sons, he says, shall give their words for him.
4477	
4478	YORK	Will you not, sons?
4479	
4480	EDWARD	Ay, noble father, if our words will serve.
4481	
4482	RICHARD	And if words will not, then our weapons shall.
4483	
4484	CLIFFORD	Why, what a brood of traitors have we here!
4485	
4486	YORK	Look in a glass, and call thy image so:
4487	I am thy king, and thou a false-heart traitor.
4488	Call hither to the stake my two brave bears,
4489	That with the very shaking of their chains
4490	They may astonish these fell-lurking curs:
4491	Bid Salisbury and Warwick come to me.
4492	
4493	[Enter the WARWICK and SALISBURY]
4494	
4495	CLIFFORD	Are these thy bears? we'll bait thy bears to death.
4496	And manacle the bear-ward in their chains,
4497	If thou darest bring them to the baiting place.
4498	
4499	RICHARD	Oft have I seen a hot o'erweening cur
4500	Run back and bite, because he was withheld;
4501	Who, being suffer'd with the bear's fell paw,
4502	Hath clapp'd his tail between his legs and cried:
4503	And such a piece of service will you do,
4504	If you oppose yourselves to match Lord Warwick.
4505	
4506	CLIFFORD	Hence, heap of wrath, foul indigested lump,
4507	As crooked in thy manners as thy shape!
4508	
4509	YORK	Nay, we shall heat you thoroughly anon.
4510	
4511	CLIFFORD	Take heed, lest by your heat you burn yourselves.
4512	
4513	KING HENRY VI	Why, Warwick, hath thy knee forgot to bow?
4514	Old Salisbury, shame to thy silver hair,
4515	Thou mad misleader of thy brain-sick son!
4516	What, wilt thou on thy death-bed play the ruffian,
4517	And seek for sorrow with thy spectacles?
4518	O, where is faith? O, where is loyalty?
4519	If it be banish'd from the frosty head,
4520	Where shall it find a harbour in the earth?
4521	Wilt thou go dig a grave to find out war,
4522	And shame thine honourable age with blood?
4523	Why art thou old, and want'st experience?
4524	Or wherefore dost abuse it, if thou hast it?
4525	For shame! in duty bend thy knee to me
4526	That bows unto the grave with mickle age.
4527	
4528	SALISBURY	My lord, I have consider'd with myself
4529	The title of this most renowned duke;
4530	And in my conscience do repute his grace
4531	The rightful heir to England's royal seat.
4532	
4533	KING HENRY VI	Hast thou not sworn allegiance unto me?
4534	
4535	SALISBURY	I have.
4536	
4537	KING HENRY VI	Canst thou dispense with heaven for such an oath?
4538	
4539	SALISBURY	It is great sin to swear unto a sin,
4540	But greater sin to keep a sinful oath.
4541	Who can be bound by any solemn vow
4542	To do a murderous deed, to rob a man,
4543	To force a spotless virgin's chastity,
4544	To reave the orphan of his patrimony,
4545	To wring the widow from her custom'd right,
4546	And have no other reason for this wrong
4547	But that he was bound by a solemn oath?
4548	
4549	QUEEN MARGARET	A subtle traitor needs no sophister.
4550	
4551	KING HENRY VI	Call Buckingham, and bid him arm himself.
4552	
4553	YORK	Call Buckingham, and all the friends thou hast,
4554	I am resolved for death or dignity.
4555	
4556	CLIFFORD	The first I warrant thee, if dreams prove true.
4557	
4558	WARWICK	You were best to go to bed and dream again,
4559	To keep thee from the tempest of the field.
4560	
4561	CLIFFORD	I am resolved to bear a greater storm
4562	Than any thou canst conjure up to-day;
4563	And that I'll write upon thy burgonet,
4564	Might I but know thee by thy household badge.
4565	
4566	WARWICK	Now, by my father's badge, old Nevil's crest,
4567	The rampant bear chain'd to the ragged staff,
4568	This day I'll wear aloft my burgonet,
4569	As on a mountain top the cedar shows
4570	That keeps his leaves in spite of any storm,
4571	Even to affright thee with the view thereof.
4572	
4573	CLIFFORD	And from thy burgonet I'll rend thy bear
4574	And tread it under foot with all contempt,
4575	Despite the bear-ward that protects the bear.
4576	
4577	YOUNG CLIFFORD	And so to arms, victorious father,
4578	To quell the rebels and their complices.
4579	
4580	RICHARD	Fie! charity, for shame! speak not in spite,
4581	For you shall sup with Jesu Christ to-night.
4582	
4583	YOUNG CLIFFORD	Foul stigmatic, that's more than thou canst tell.
4584	
4585	RICHARD	If not in heaven, you'll surely sup in hell.

4599	SCENE II	Saint Alban's.
4600	
4601	
4602	[Alarums to the battle. Enter WARWICK]
4603	
4604	WARWICK	Clifford of Cumberland, 'tis Warwick calls:
4605	And if thou dost not hide thee from the bear,
4606	Now, when the angry trumpet sounds alarum
4607	And dead men's cries do fill the empty air,
4608	Clifford, I say, come forth and fight with me:
4609	Proud northern lord, Clifford of Cumberland,
4610	Warwick is hoarse with calling thee to arms.
4611	
4612	[Enter YORK]
4613	
4614	How now, my noble lord? what, all afoot?
4615	
4616	YORK	The deadly-handed Clifford slew my steed,
4617	But match to match I have encounter'd him
4618	And made a prey for carrion kites and crows
4619	Even of the bonny beast he loved so well.
4620	
4621	[Enter CLIFFORD]
4622	
4623	WARWICK	Of one or both of us the time is come.
4624	
4625	YORK	Hold, Warwick, seek thee out some other chase,
4626	For I myself must hunt this deer to death.
4627	
4628	WARWICK	Then, nobly, York; 'tis for a crown thou fight'st.
4629	As I intend, Clifford, to thrive to-day,
4630	It grieves my soul to leave thee unassail'd.
4631	
4632	[Exit]
4633	
4634	CLIFFORD	What seest thou in me, York? why dost thou pause?
4635	
4636	YORK	With thy brave bearing should I be in love,
4637	But that thou art so fast mine enemy.
4638	
4639	CLIFFORD	Nor should thy prowess want praise and esteem,
4640	But that 'tis shown ignobly and in treason.
4641	
4642	YORK	So let it help me now against thy sword
4643	As I in justice and true right express it.
4644	
4645	CLIFFORD	My soul and body on the action both!
4646	
4647	YORK	A dreadful lay! Address thee instantly.
4648	
4649	[They fight, and CLIFFORD falls]

4656	Peace with his soul, heaven, if it be thy will!

4658	[Exit]
4659	
4660	[Enter YOUNG CLIFFORD]
4661	
4662	YOUNG CLIFFORD	Shame and confusion! all is on the rout;
4663	Fear frames disorder, and disorder wounds
4664	Where it should guard. O war, thou son of hell,
4665	Whom angry heavens do make their minister
4666	Throw in the frozen bosoms of our part
4667	Hot coals of vengeance! Let no soldier fly.
4668	He that is truly dedicate to war
4669	Hath no self-love, nor he that loves himself
4670	Hath not essentially but by circumstance
4671	The name of valour.
4672	
4673	[Seeing his dead father]
4674	
4675	O, let the vile world end,
4676	And the premised flames of the last day
4677	Knit earth and heaven together!
4678	Now let the general trumpet blow his blast,
4679	Particularities and petty sounds
4680	To cease! Wast thou ordain'd, dear father,
4681	To lose thy youth in peace, and to achieve
4682	The silver livery of advised age,
4683	And, in thy reverence and thy chair-days, thus
4684	To die in ruffian battle? Even at this sight
4685	My heart is turn'd to stone: and while 'tis mine,
4686	It shall be stony. York not our old men spares;
4687	No more will I their babes: tears virginal
4688	Shall be to me even as the dew to fire,
4689	And beauty that the tyrant oft reclaims
4690	Shall to my flaming wrath be oil and flax.
4691	Henceforth I will not have to do with pity:
4692	Meet I an infant of the house of York,
4693	Into as many gobbets will I cut it
4694	As wild Medea young Absyrtus did:
4695	In cruelty will I seek out my fame.
4696	Come, thou new ruin of old Clifford's house:
4697	As did AEneas old Anchises bear,
4698	So bear I thee upon my manly shoulders;
4699	But then AEneas bare a living load,
4700	Nothing so heavy as these woes of mine.

4706	
4707	RICHARD	So, lie thou there;
4708	For underneath an alehouse' paltry sign,
4709	The Castle in Saint Alban's, Somerset
4710	Hath made the wizard famous in his death.
4711	Sword, hold thy temper; heart, be wrathful still:
4712	Priests pray for enemies, but princes kill.
4713	
4714	[Exit]
4715	
4716	[Fight: excursions. Enter KING HENRY VI, QUEEN
4717	MARGARET, and others]
4718	
4719	QUEEN MARGARET	Away, my lord! you are slow; for shame, away!
4720	
4721	KING HENRY VI	Can we outrun the heavens? good Margaret, stay.
4722	
4723	QUEEN MARGARET	What are you made of? you'll nor fight nor fly:
4724	Now is it manhood, wisdom and defence,
4725	To give the enemy way, and to secure us
4726	By what we can, which can no more but fly.
4727	
4728	[Alarum afar off]
4729	
4730	If you be ta'en, we then should see the bottom
4731	Of all our fortunes: but if we haply scape,
4732	As well we may, if not through your neglect,
4733	We shall to London get, where you are loved
4734	And where this breach now in our fortunes made
4735	May readily be stopp'd.
4736	
4737	[Re-enter YOUNG CLIFFORD]
4738	
4739	YOUNG CLIFFORD	But that my heart's on future mischief set,
4740	I would speak blasphemy ere bid you fly:
4741	But fly you must; uncurable discomfit
4742	Reigns in the hearts of all our present parts.
4743	Away, for your relief! and we will live
4744	To see their day and them our fortune give:
4745	Away, my lord, away!
4746	
4747	[Exeunt]

4752	2 KING HENRY VI
4753	
4754	
4755	ACT V
4756	
4757	
4758	
4759	SCENE III	Fields near St. Alban's.
4760	
4761	
4762	[Alarum. Retreat. Enter YORK, RICHARD, WARWICK,
4763	and Soldiers, with drum and colours]
4764	
4765	YORK	Of Salisbury, who can report of him,
4766	That winter lion, who in rage forgets
4767	Aged contusions and all brush of time,
4768	And, like a gallant in the brow of youth,
4769	Repairs him with occasion? This happy day
4770	Is not itself, nor have we won one foot,
4771	If Salisbury be lost.
4772	
4773	RICHARD	My noble father,
4774	Three times to-day I holp him to his horse,
4775	Three times bestrid him; thrice I led him off,
4776	Persuaded him from any further act:
4777	But still, where danger was, still there I met him;
4778	And like rich hangings in a homely house,
4779	So was his will in his old feeble body.
4780	But, noble as he is, look where he comes.
4781	
4782	[Enter SALISBURY]
4783	
4784	SALISBURY	Now, by my sword, well hast thou fought to-day;
4785	By the mass, so did we all. I thank you, Richard:
4786	God knows how long it is I have to live;
4787	And it hath pleased him that three times to-day
4788	You have defended me from imminent death.
4789	Well, lords, we have not got that which we have:
4790	'Tis not enough our foes are this time fled,
4791	Being opposites of such repairing nature.
4792	
4793	YORK	I know our safety is to follow them;
4794	For, as I hear, the king is fled to London,
4795	To call a present court of parliament.
4796	Let us pursue him ere the writs go forth.
4797	What says Lord Warwick? shall we after them?
4798	
4799	WARWICK	After them! nay, before them, if we can.
4800	Now, by my faith, lords, 'twas a glorious day:
4801	Saint Alban's battle won by famous York
4802	Shall be eternized in all age to come.
4803	Sound drums and trumpets, and to London all:
4804	And more such days as these to us befall!
4805	
4806	[Exeunt]

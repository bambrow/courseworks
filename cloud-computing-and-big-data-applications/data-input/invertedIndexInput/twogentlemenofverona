47	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
48	
49	
50	ACT I
51	
52	
53	
54	SCENE I	Verona. An open place.
55	
56	
57	[Enter VALENTINE and PROTEUS]
58	
59	VALENTINE	Cease to persuade, my loving Proteus:
60	Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
61	Were't not affection chains thy tender days
62	To the sweet glances of thy honour'd love,
63	I rather would entreat thy company
64	To see the wonders of the world abroad,
65	Than, living dully sluggardized at home,
66	Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness.
67	But since thou lovest, love still and thrive therein,
68	Even as I would when I to love begin.
69	
70	PROTEUS	Wilt thou be gone? Sweet Valentine, adieu!
71	Think on thy Proteus, when thou haply seest
72	Some rare note-worthy object in thy travel:
73	Wish me partaker in thy happiness
74	When thou dost meet good hap; and in thy danger,
75	If ever danger do environ thee,
76	Commend thy grievance to my holy prayers,
77	For I will be thy beadsman, Valentine.
78	
79	VALENTINE	And on a love-book pray for my success?
80	
81	PROTEUS	Upon some book I love I'll pray for thee.
82	
83	VALENTINE	That's on some shallow story of deep love:
84	How young Leander cross'd the Hellespont.
85	
86	PROTEUS	That's a deep story of a deeper love:
87	For he was more than over shoes in love.
88	
89	VALENTINE	'Tis true; for you are over boots in love,
90	And yet you never swum the Hellespont.
91	
92	PROTEUS	Over the boots? nay, give me not the boots.
93	
94	VALENTINE	No, I will not, for it boots thee not.
95	
96	PROTEUS	What?
97	
98	VALENTINE	To be in love, where scorn is bought with groans;
99	Coy looks with heart-sore sighs; one fading moment's mirth
100	With twenty watchful, weary, tedious nights:
101	If haply won, perhaps a hapless gain;
102	If lost, why then a grievous labour won;
103	However, but a folly bought with wit,
104	Or else a wit by folly vanquished.
105	
106	PROTEUS	So, by your circumstance, you call me fool.
107	
108	VALENTINE	So, by your circumstance, I fear you'll prove.
109	
110	PROTEUS	'Tis love you cavil at: I am not Love.
111	
112	VALENTINE	Love is your master, for he masters you:
113	And he that is so yoked by a fool,
114	Methinks, should not be chronicled for wise.
115	
116	PROTEUS	Yet writers say, as in the sweetest bud
117	The eating canker dwells, so eating love
118	Inhabits in the finest wits of all.
119	
120	VALENTINE	And writers say, as the most forward bud
121	Is eaten by the canker ere it blow,
122	Even so by love the young and tender wit
123	Is turn'd to folly, blasting in the bud,
124	Losing his verdure even in the prime
125	And all the fair effects of future hopes.
126	But wherefore waste I time to counsel thee,
127	That art a votary to fond desire?
128	Once more adieu! my father at the road
129	Expects my coming, there to see me shipp'd.
130	
131	PROTEUS	And thither will I bring thee, Valentine.
132	
133	VALENTINE	Sweet Proteus, no; now let us take our leave.
134	To Milan let me hear from thee by letters
135	Of thy success in love, and what news else
136	Betideth here in absence of thy friend;
137	And likewise will visit thee with mine.
138	
139	PROTEUS	All happiness bechance to thee in Milan!
140	
141	VALENTINE	As much to you at home! and so, farewell.
142	
143	[Exit]
144	
145	PROTEUS	He after honour hunts, I after love:
146	He leaves his friends to dignify them more,
147	I leave myself, my friends and all, for love.
148	Thou, Julia, thou hast metamorphosed me,
149	Made me neglect my studies, lose my time,
150	War with good counsel, set the world at nought;
151	Made wit with musing weak, heart sick with thought.
152	
153	[Enter SPEED]
154	
155	SPEED	Sir Proteus, save you! Saw you my master?
156	
157	PROTEUS	But now he parted hence, to embark for Milan.
158	
159	SPEED	Twenty to one then he is shipp'd already,
160	And I have play'd the sheep in losing him.
161	
162	PROTEUS	Indeed, a sheep doth very often stray,
163	An if the shepherd be a while away.
164	
165	SPEED	You conclude that my master is a shepherd, then,
166	and I a sheep?
167	
168	PROTEUS	I do.
169	
170	SPEED	Why then, my horns are his horns, whether I wake or sleep.
171	
172	PROTEUS	A silly answer and fitting well a sheep.
173	
174	SPEED	This proves me still a sheep.
175	
176	PROTEUS	True; and thy master a shepherd.
177	
178	SPEED	Nay, that I can deny by a circumstance.
179	
180	PROTEUS	It shall go hard but I'll prove it by another.
181	
182	SPEED	The shepherd seeks the sheep, and not the sheep the
183	shepherd; but I seek my master, and my master seeks
184	not me: therefore I am no sheep.
185	
186	PROTEUS	The sheep for fodder follow the shepherd; the
187	shepherd for food follows not the sheep: thou for
188	wages followest thy master; thy master for wages
189	follows not thee: therefore thou art a sheep.
190	
191	SPEED	Such another proof will make me cry 'baa.'
192	
193	PROTEUS	But, dost thou hear? gavest thou my letter to Julia?
194	
195	SPEED	Ay sir: I, a lost mutton, gave your letter to her,
196	a laced mutton, and she, a laced mutton, gave me, a
197	lost mutton, nothing for my labour.
198	
199	PROTEUS	Here's too small a pasture for such store of muttons.
200	
201	SPEED	If the ground be overcharged, you were best stick her.
202	
203	PROTEUS	Nay: in that you are astray, 'twere best pound you.
204	
205	SPEED	Nay, sir, less than a pound shall serve me for
206	carrying your letter.
207	
208	PROTEUS	You mistake; I mean the pound,--a pinfold.
209	
210	SPEED	From a pound to a pin? fold it over and over,
211	'Tis threefold too little for carrying a letter to
212	your lover.
213	
214	PROTEUS	But what said she?
215	
216	SPEED	[First nodding]  Ay.
217	
218	PROTEUS	Nod--Ay--why, that's noddy.
219	
220	SPEED	You mistook, sir; I say, she did nod: and you ask
221	me if she did nod; and I say, 'Ay.'
222	
223	PROTEUS	And that set together is noddy.
224	
225	SPEED	Now you have taken the pains to set it together,
226	take it for your pains.
227	
228	PROTEUS	No, no; you shall have it for bearing the letter.
229	
230	SPEED	Well, I perceive I must be fain to bear with you.
231	
232	PROTEUS	Why sir, how do you bear with me?
233	
234	SPEED	Marry, sir, the letter, very orderly; having nothing
235	but the word 'noddy' for my pains.
236	
237	PROTEUS	Beshrew me, but you have a quick wit.
238	
239	SPEED	And yet it cannot overtake your slow purse.
240	
241	PROTEUS	Come come, open the matter in brief: what said she?
242	
243	SPEED	Open your purse, that the money and the matter may
244	be both at once delivered.
245	
246	PROTEUS	Well, sir, here is for your pains. What said she?
247	
248	SPEED	Truly, sir, I think you'll hardly win her.
249	
250	PROTEUS	Why, couldst thou perceive so much from her?
251	
252	SPEED	Sir, I could perceive nothing at all from her; no,
253	not so much as a ducat for delivering your letter:
254	and being so hard to me that brought your mind, I
255	fear she'll prove as hard to you in telling your
256	mind. Give her no token but stones; for she's as
257	hard as steel.
258	
259	PROTEUS	What said she? nothing?
260	
261	SPEED	No, not so much as 'Take this for thy pains.' To
262	testify your bounty, I thank you, you have testerned
263	me; in requital whereof, henceforth carry your
264	letters yourself: and so, sir, I'll commend you to my master.
265	
266	PROTEUS	Go, go, be gone, to save your ship from wreck,
267	Which cannot perish having thee aboard,
268	Being destined to a drier death on shore.
269	
270	[Exit SPEED]
271	
272	I must go send some better messenger:
273	I fear my Julia would not deign my lines,
274	Receiving them from such a worthless post.
275	
276	[Exit]

281	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
282	
283	
284	ACT I
285	
286	
287	
288	SCENE II	The same. Garden of JULIA's house.
289	
290	
291	[Enter JULlA and LUCETTA]
292	
293	JULIA	But say, Lucetta, now we are alone,
294	Wouldst thou then counsel me to fall in love?
295	
296	LUCETTA	Ay, madam, so you stumble not unheedfully.
297	
298	JULIA	Of all the fair resort of gentlemen
299	That every day with parle encounter me,
300	In thy opinion which is worthiest love?
301	
302	LUCETTA	Please you repeat their names, I'll show my mind
303	According to my shallow simple skill.
304	
305	JULIA	What think'st thou of the fair Sir Eglamour?
306	
307	LUCETTA	As of a knight well-spoken, neat and fine;
308	But, were I you, he never should be mine.
309	
310	JULIA	What think'st thou of the rich Mercatio?
311	
312	LUCETTA	Well of his wealth; but of himself, so so.
313	
314	JULIA	What think'st thou of the gentle Proteus?
315	
316	LUCETTA	Lord, Lord! to see what folly reigns in us!
317	
318	JULIA	How now! what means this passion at his name?
319	
320	LUCETTA	Pardon, dear madam: 'tis a passing shame
321	That I, unworthy body as I am,
322	Should censure thus on lovely gentlemen.
323	
324	JULIA	Why not on Proteus, as of all the rest?
325	
326	LUCETTA	Then thus: of many good I think him best.
327	
328	JULIA	Your reason?
329	
330	LUCETTA	I have no other, but a woman's reason;
331	I think him so because I think him so.
332	
333	JULIA	And wouldst thou have me cast my love on him?
334	
335	LUCETTA	Ay, if you thought your love not cast away.
336	
337	JULIA	Why he, of all the rest, hath never moved me.
338	
339	LUCETTA	Yet he, of all the rest, I think, best loves ye.
340	
341	JULIA	His little speaking shows his love but small.
342	
343	LUCETTA	Fire that's closest kept burns most of all.
344	
345	JULIA	They do not love that do not show their love.
346	
347	LUCETTA	O, they love least that let men know their love.
348	
349	JULIA	I would I knew his mind.
350	
351	LUCETTA	Peruse this paper, madam.
352	
353	JULIA	'To Julia.' Say, from whom?
354	
355	LUCETTA	That the contents will show.
356	
357	JULIA	Say, say, who gave it thee?
358	
359	LUCETTA	Valentine's page; and sent, I think, from Proteus.
360	He would have given it you; but I, being in the way,
361	Did in your name receive it: pardon the
362	fault I pray.
363	
364	JULIA	Now, by my modesty, a goodly broker!
365	Dare you presume to harbour wanton lines?
366	To whisper and conspire against my youth?
367	Now, trust me, 'tis an office of great worth
368	And you an officer fit for the place.
369	Or else return no more into my sight.
370	
371	LUCETTA	To plead for love deserves more fee than hate.
372	
373	JULIA	Will ye be gone?
374	
375	LUCETTA	                  That you may ruminate.
376	
377	[Exit]
378	
379	JULIA	And yet I would I had o'erlooked the letter:
380	It were a shame to call her back again
381	And pray her to a fault for which I chid her.
382	What a fool is she, that knows I am a maid,
383	And would not force the letter to my view!
384	Since maids, in modesty, say 'no' to that
385	Which they would have the profferer construe 'ay.'
386	Fie, fie, how wayward is this foolish love
387	That, like a testy babe, will scratch the nurse
388	And presently all humbled kiss the rod!
389	How churlishly I chid Lucetta hence,
390	When willingly I would have had her here!
391	How angerly I taught my brow to frown,
392	When inward joy enforced my heart to smile!
393	My penance is to call Lucetta back
394	And ask remission for my folly past.
395	What ho! Lucetta!
396	
397	[Re-enter LUCETTA]
398	
399	LUCETTA	                  What would your ladyship?
400	
401	JULIA	Is't near dinner-time?
402	
403	LUCETTA	I would it were,
404	That you might kill your stomach on your meat
405	And not upon your maid.
406	
407	JULIA	What is't that you took up so gingerly?
408	
409	LUCETTA	Nothing.
410	
411	JULIA	Why didst thou stoop, then?
412	
413	LUCETTA	To take a paper up that I let fall.
414	
415	JULIA	And is that paper nothing?
416	
417	LUCETTA	Nothing concerning me.
418	
419	JULIA	Then let it lie for those that it concerns.
420	
421	LUCETTA	Madam, it will not lie where it concerns
422	Unless it have a false interpeter.
423	
424	JULIA	Some love of yours hath writ to you in rhyme.
425	
426	LUCETTA	That I might sing it, madam, to a tune.
427	Give me a note: your ladyship can set.
428	
429	JULIA	As little by such toys as may be possible.
430	Best sing it to the tune of 'Light o' love.'
431	
432	LUCETTA	It is too heavy for so light a tune.
433	
434	JULIA	Heavy! belike it hath some burden then?
435	
436	LUCETTA	Ay, and melodious were it, would you sing it.
437	
438	JULIA	And why not you?
439	
440	LUCETTA	                  I cannot reach so high.
441	
442	JULIA	Let's see your song. How now, minion!
443	
444	LUCETTA	Keep tune there still, so you will sing it out:
445	And yet methinks I do not like this tune.
446	
447	JULIA	You do not?
448	
449	LUCETTA	          No, madam; it is too sharp.
450	
451	JULIA	You, minion, are too saucy.
452	
453	LUCETTA	Nay, now you are too flat
454	And mar the concord with too harsh a descant:
455	There wanteth but a mean to fill your song.
456	
457	JULIA	The mean is drown'd with your unruly bass.
458	
459	LUCETTA	Indeed, I bid the base for Proteus.
460	
461	JULIA	This babble shall not henceforth trouble me.
462	Here is a coil with protestation!
463	
464	[Tears the letter]
465	
466	Go get you gone, and let the papers lie:
467	You would be fingering them, to anger me.
468	
469	LUCETTA	She makes it strange; but she would be best pleased
470	To be so anger'd with another letter.
471	
472	[Exit]
473	
474	JULIA	 Nay, would I were so anger'd with the same!
475	O hateful hands, to tear such loving words!
476	Injurious wasps, to feed on such sweet honey
477	And kill the bees that yield it with your stings!
478	I'll kiss each several paper for amends.
479	Look, here is writ 'kind Julia.' Unkind Julia!
480	As in revenge of thy ingratitude,
481	I throw thy name against the bruising stones,
482	Trampling contemptuously on thy disdain.
483	And here is writ 'love-wounded Proteus.'
484	Poor wounded name! my bosom as a bed
485	Shall lodge thee till thy wound be thoroughly heal'd;
486	And thus I search it with a sovereign kiss.
487	But twice or thrice was 'Proteus' written down.
488	Be calm, good wind, blow not a word away
489	Till I have found each letter in the letter,
490	Except mine own name: that some whirlwind bear
491	Unto a ragged fearful-hanging rock
492	And throw it thence into the raging sea!
493	Lo, here in one line is his name twice writ,
494	'Poor forlorn Proteus, passionate Proteus,
495	To the sweet Julia:' that I'll tear away.
496	And yet I will not, sith so prettily
497	He couples it to his complaining names.
498	Thus will I fold them one on another:
499	Now kiss, embrace, contend, do what you will.
500	
501	[Re-enter LUCETTA]
502	
503	LUCETTA	Madam,
504	Dinner is ready, and your father stays.
505	
506	JULIA	Well, let us go.
507	
508	LUCETTA	What, shall these papers lie like tell-tales here?
509	
510	JULIA	If you respect them, best to take them up.
511	
512	LUCETTA	Nay, I was taken up for laying them down:
513	Yet here they shall not lie, for catching cold.
514	
515	JULIA	I see you have a month's mind to them.
516	
517	LUCETTA	Ay, madam, you may say what sights you see;
518	I see things too, although you judge I wink.
519	
520	JULIA	Come, come; will't please you go?
521	
522	[Exeunt]

526	
527	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
528	
529	
530	ACT I
531	
532	
533	
534	SCENE III	The same. ANTONIO's house.
535	
536	
537	[Enter ANTONIO and PANTHINO]
538	
539	ANTONIO	Tell me, Panthino, what sad talk was that
540	Wherewith my brother held you in the cloister?
541	
542	PANTHINO	'Twas of his nephew Proteus, your son.
543	
544	ANTONIO	Why, what of him?
545	
546	PANTHINO	                  He wonder'd that your lordship
547	Would suffer him to spend his youth at home,
548	While other men, of slender reputation,
549	Put forth their sons to seek preferment out:
550	Some to the wars, to try their fortune there;
551	Some to discover islands far away;
552	Some to the studious universities.
553	For any or for all these exercises,
554	He said that Proteus your son was meet,
555	And did request me to importune you
556	To let him spend his time no more at home,
557	Which would be great impeachment to his age,
558	In having known no travel in his youth.
559	
560	ANTONIO	Nor need'st thou much importune me to that
561	Whereon this month I have been hammering.
562	I have consider'd well his loss of time
563	And how he cannot be a perfect man,
564	Not being tried and tutor'd in the world:
565	Experience is by industry achieved
566	And perfected by the swift course of time.
567	Then tell me, whither were I best to send him?
568	
569	PANTHINO	I think your lordship is not ignorant
570	How his companion, youthful Valentine,
571	Attends the emperor in his royal court.
572	
573	ANTONIO	I know it well.
574	
575	PANTHINO	'Twere good, I think, your lordship sent him thither:
576	There shall he practise tilts and tournaments,
577	Hear sweet discourse, converse with noblemen.
578	And be in eye of every exercise
579	Worthy his youth and nobleness of birth.
580	
581	ANTONIO	I like thy counsel; well hast thou advised:
582	And that thou mayst perceive how well I like it,
583	The execution of it shall make known.
584	Even with the speediest expedition
585	I will dispatch him to the emperor's court.
586	
587	PANTHINO	To-morrow, may it please you, Don Alphonso,
588	With other gentlemen of good esteem,
589	Are journeying to salute the emperor
590	And to commend their service to his will.
591	
592	ANTONIO	Good company; with them shall Proteus go:
593	And, in good time! now will we break with him.
594	
595	[Enter PROTEUS]
596	
597	PROTEUS	Sweet love! sweet lines! sweet life!
598	Here is her hand, the agent of her heart;
599	Here is her oath for love, her honour's pawn.
600	O, that our fathers would applaud our loves,
601	To seal our happiness with their consents!
602	O heavenly Julia!
603	
604	ANTONIO	How now! what letter are you reading there?
605	
606	PROTEUS	May't please your lordship, 'tis a word or two
607	Of commendations sent from Valentine,
608	Deliver'd by a friend that came from him.
609	
610	ANTONIO	Lend me the letter; let me see what news.
611	
612	PROTEUS	There is no news, my lord, but that he writes
613	How happily he lives, how well beloved
614	And daily graced by the emperor;
615	Wishing me with him, partner of his fortune.
616	
617	ANTONIO	And how stand you affected to his wish?
618	
619	PROTEUS	As one relying on your lordship's will
620	And not depending on his friendly wish.
621	
622	ANTONIO	My will is something sorted with his wish.
623	Muse not that I thus suddenly proceed;
624	For what I will, I will, and there an end.
625	I am resolved that thou shalt spend some time
626	With Valentinus in the emperor's court:
627	What maintenance he from his friends receives,
628	Like exhibition thou shalt have from me.
629	To-morrow be in readiness to go:
630	Excuse it not, for I am peremptory.
631	
632	PROTEUS	My lord, I cannot be so soon provided:
633	Please you, deliberate a day or two.
634	
635	ANTONIO	Look, what thou want'st shall be sent after thee:
636	No more of stay! to-morrow thou must go.
637	Come on, Panthino: you shall be employ'd
638	To hasten on his expedition.
639	
640	[Exeunt ANTONIO and PANTHINO]
641	
642	PROTEUS	Thus have I shunn'd the fire for fear of burning,
643	And drench'd me in the sea, where I am drown'd.
644	I fear'd to show my father Julia's letter,
645	Lest he should take exceptions to my love;
646	And with the vantage of mine own excuse
647	Hath he excepted most against my love.
648	O, how this spring of love resembleth
649	The uncertain glory of an April day,
650	Which now shows all the beauty of the sun,
651	And by and by a cloud takes all away!
652	
653	[Re-enter PANTHINO]
654	
655	PANTHINO	Sir Proteus, your father calls for you:
656	He is in haste; therefore, I pray you to go.
657	
658	PROTEUS	Why, this it is: my heart accords thereto,
659	And yet a thousand times it answers 'no.'

666	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
667	
668	
669	ACT II
670	
671	
672	
673	SCENE I	Milan. The DUKE's palace.
674	
675	
676	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]
677	
678	SPEED	Sir, your glove.
679	
680	VALENTINE	                  Not mine; my gloves are on.
681	
682	SPEED	Why, then, this may be yours, for this is but one.
683	
684	VALENTINE	Ha! let me see: ay, give it me, it's mine:
685	Sweet ornament that decks a thing divine!
686	Ah, Silvia, Silvia!
687	
688	SPEED	Madam Silvia! Madam Silvia!
689	
690	VALENTINE	How now, sirrah?
691	
692	SPEED	She is not within hearing, sir.
693	
694	VALENTINE	Why, sir, who bade you call her?
695	
696	SPEED	Your worship, sir; or else I mistook.
697	
698	VALENTINE	Well, you'll still be too forward.
699	
700	SPEED	And yet I was last chidden for being too slow.
701	
702	VALENTINE	Go to, sir: tell me, do you know Madam Silvia?
703	
704	SPEED	She that your worship loves?
705	
706	VALENTINE	Why, how know you that I am in love?
707	
708	SPEED	Marry, by these special marks: first, you have
709	learned, like Sir Proteus, to wreathe your arms,
710	like a malecontent; to relish a love-song, like a
711	robin-redbreast; to walk alone, like one that had
712	the pestilence; to sigh, like a school-boy that had
713	lost his A B C; to weep, like a young wench that had
714	buried her grandam; to fast, like one that takes
715	diet; to watch like one that fears robbing; to
716	speak puling, like a beggar at Hallowmas. You were
717	wont, when you laughed, to crow like a cock; when you
718	walked, to walk like one of the lions; when you
719	fasted, it was presently after dinner; when you
720	looked sadly, it was for want of money: and now you
721	are metamorphosed with a mistress, that, when I look
722	on you, I can hardly think you my master.
723	
724	VALENTINE	Are all these things perceived in me?
725	
726	SPEED	They are all perceived without ye.
727	
728	VALENTINE	Without me? they cannot.
729	
730	SPEED	Without you? nay, that's certain, for, without you
731	were so simple, none else would: but you are so
732	without these follies, that these follies are within
733	you and shine through you like the water in an
734	urinal, that not an eye that sees you but is a
735	physician to comment on your malady.
736	
737	VALENTINE	But tell me, dost thou know my lady Silvia?
738	
739	SPEED	She that you gaze on so as she sits at supper?
740	
741	VALENTINE	Hast thou observed that? even she, I mean.
742	
743	SPEED	Why, sir, I know her not.
744	
745	VALENTINE	Dost thou know her by my gazing on her, and yet
746	knowest her not?
747	
748	SPEED	Is she not hard-favoured, sir?
749	
750	VALENTINE	Not so fair, boy, as well-favoured.
751	
752	SPEED	Sir, I know that well enough.
753	
754	VALENTINE	What dost thou know?
755	
756	SPEED	That she is not so fair as, of you, well-favoured.
757	
758	VALENTINE	I mean that her beauty is exquisite, but her favour infinite.
759	
760	SPEED	That's because the one is painted and the other out
761	of all count.
762	
763	VALENTINE	How painted? and how out of count?
764	
765	SPEED	Marry, sir, so painted, to make her fair, that no
766	man counts of her beauty.
767	
768	VALENTINE	How esteemest thou me? I account of her beauty.
769	
770	SPEED	You never saw her since she was deformed.
771	
772	VALENTINE	How long hath she been deformed?
773	
774	SPEED	Ever since you loved her.
775	
776	VALENTINE	I have loved her ever since I saw her; and still I
777	see her beautiful.
778	
779	SPEED	If you love her, you cannot see her.
780	
781	VALENTINE	Why?
782	
783	SPEED	Because Love is blind. O, that you had mine eyes;
784	or your own eyes had the lights they were wont to
785	have when you chid at Sir Proteus for going
786	ungartered!
787	
788	VALENTINE	What should I see then?
789	
790	SPEED	Your own present folly and her passing deformity:
791	for he, being in love, could not see to garter his
792	hose, and you, being in love, cannot see to put on your hose.
793	
794	VALENTINE	Belike, boy, then, you are in love; for last
795	morning you could not see to wipe my shoes.
796	
797	SPEED	True, sir; I was in love with my bed: I thank you,
798	you swinged me for my love, which makes me the
799	bolder to chide you for yours.
800	
801	VALENTINE	In conclusion, I stand affected to her.
802	
803	SPEED	I would you were set, so your affection would cease.
804	
805	VALENTINE	Last night she enjoined me to write some lines to
806	one she loves.
807	
808	SPEED	And have you?
809	
810	VALENTINE	I have.
811	
812	SPEED	Are they not lamely writ?
813	
814	VALENTINE	No, boy, but as well as I can do them. Peace!
815	here she comes.
816	
817	SPEED	[Aside]  O excellent motion! O exceeding puppet!
818	Now will he interpret to her.
819	
820	[Enter SILVIA]
821	
822	VALENTINE	Madam and mistress, a thousand good-morrows.
823	
824	SPEED	[Aside]  O, give ye good even! here's a million of manners.
825	
826	SILVIA	Sir Valentine and servant, to you two thousand.
827	
828	SPEED	[Aside]  He should give her interest and she gives it him.
829	
830	VALENTINE	As you enjoin'd me, I have writ your letter
831	Unto the secret nameless friend of yours;
832	Which I was much unwilling to proceed in
833	But for my duty to your ladyship.
834	
835	SILVIA	I thank you gentle servant: 'tis very clerkly done.
836	
837	VALENTINE	Now trust me, madam, it came hardly off;
838	For being ignorant to whom it goes
839	I writ at random, very doubtfully.
840	
841	SILVIA	Perchance you think too much of so much pains?
842	
843	VALENTINE	No, madam; so it stead you, I will write
844	Please you command, a thousand times as much; And yet--
845	
846	SILVIA	A pretty period! Well, I guess the sequel;
847	And yet I will not name it; and yet I care not;
848	And yet take this again; and yet I thank you,
849	Meaning henceforth to trouble you no more.
850	
851	SPEED	[Aside]  And yet you will; and yet another 'yet.'
852	
853	VALENTINE	What means your ladyship? do you not like it?
854	
855	SILVIA	Yes, yes; the lines are very quaintly writ;
856	But since unwillingly, take them again.
857	Nay, take them.
858	
859	VALENTINE	Madam, they are for you.
860	
861	SILVIA	Ay, ay: you writ them, sir, at my request;
862	But I will none of them; they are for you;
863	I would have had them writ more movingly.
864	
865	VALENTINE	Please you, I'll write your ladyship another.
866	
867	SILVIA	And when it's writ, for my sake read it over,
868	And if it please you, so; if not, why, so.
869	
870	VALENTINE	If it please me, madam, what then?
871	
872	SILVIA	Why, if it please you, take it for your labour:
873	And so, good morrow, servant.
874	
875	[Exit]
876	
877	SPEED	O jest unseen, inscrutable, invisible,
878	As a nose on a man's face, or a weathercock on a steeple!
879	My master sues to her, and she hath
880	taught her suitor,
881	He being her pupil, to become her tutor.
882	O excellent device! was there ever heard a better,
883	That my master, being scribe, to himself should write
884	the letter?
885	
886	VALENTINE	How now, sir? what are you reasoning with yourself?
887	
888	SPEED	Nay, I was rhyming: 'tis you that have the reason.
889	
890	VALENTINE	To do what?
891	
892	SPEED	To be a spokesman for Madam Silvia.
893	
894	VALENTINE	To whom?
895	
896	SPEED	To yourself: why, she wooes you by a figure.
897	
898	VALENTINE	What figure?
899	
900	SPEED	By a letter, I should say.
901	
902	VALENTINE	Why, she hath not writ to me?
903	
904	SPEED	What need she, when she hath made you write to
905	yourself? Why, do you not perceive the jest?
906	
907	VALENTINE	No, believe me.
908	
909	SPEED	No believing you, indeed, sir. But did you perceive
910	her earnest?
911	
912	VALENTINE	She gave me none, except an angry word.
913	
914	SPEED	Why, she hath given you a letter.
915	
916	VALENTINE	That's the letter I writ to her friend.
917	
918	SPEED	And that letter hath she delivered, and there an end.
919	
920	VALENTINE	I would it were no worse.
921	
922	SPEED	I'll warrant you, 'tis as well:
923	For often have you writ to her, and she, in modesty,
924	Or else for want of idle time, could not again reply;
925	Or fearing else some messenger that might her mind discover,
926	Herself hath taught her love himself to write unto her lover.
927	All this I speak in print, for in print I found it.
928	Why muse you, sir? 'tis dinner-time.
929	
930	VALENTINE	I have dined.
931	
932	SPEED	Ay, but hearken, sir; though the chameleon Love can
933	feed on the air, I am one that am nourished by my
934	victuals, and would fain have meat. O, be not like
935	your mistress; be moved, be moved.

952	[Enter PROTEUS and JULIA]
953	
954	PROTEUS	Have patience, gentle Julia.
955	
956	JULIA	I must, where is no remedy.
957	
958	PROTEUS	When possibly I can, I will return.
959	
960	JULIA	If you turn not, you will return the sooner.
961	Keep this remembrance for thy Julia's sake.
962	
963	[Giving a ring]
964	
965	PROTEUS	Why then, we'll make exchange; here, take you this.
966	
967	JULIA	And seal the bargain with a holy kiss.
968	
969	PROTEUS	Here is my hand for my true constancy;
970	And when that hour o'erslips me in the day
971	Wherein I sigh not, Julia, for thy sake,
972	The next ensuing hour some foul mischance
973	Torment me for my love's forgetfulness!
974	My father stays my coming; answer not;
975	The tide is now: nay, not thy tide of tears;
976	That tide will stay me longer than I should.
977	Julia, farewell!
978	
979	[Exit JULIA]
980	
981	What, gone without a word?
982	Ay, so true love should do: it cannot speak;
983	For truth hath better deeds than words to grace it.
984	
985	[Enter PANTHINO]
986	
987	PANTHINO	Sir Proteus, you are stay'd for.
988

1005	
1006	
1007	[Enter LAUNCE, leading a dog]
1008	
1009	LAUNCE	Nay, 'twill be this hour ere I have done weeping;
1010	all the kind of the Launces have this very fault. I
1011	have received my proportion, like the prodigious
1012	son, and am going with Sir Proteus to the Imperial's
1013	court. I think Crab, my dog, be the sourest-natured
1014	dog that lives: my mother weeping, my father
1015	wailing, my sister crying, our maid howling, our cat
1016	wringing her hands, and all our house in a great
1017	perplexity, yet did not this cruel-hearted cur shed
1018	one tear: he is a stone, a very pebble stone, and
1019	has no more pity in him than a dog: a Jew would have
1020	wept to have seen our parting; why, my grandam,
1021	having no eyes, look you, wept herself blind at my
1022	parting. Nay, I'll show you the manner of it. This
1023	shoe is my father: no, this left shoe is my father:
1024	no, no, this left shoe is my mother: nay, that
1025	cannot be so neither: yes, it is so, it is so, it
1026	hath the worser sole. This shoe, with the hole in
1027	it, is my mother, and this my father; a vengeance
1028	on't! there 'tis: now, sit, this staff is my
1029	sister, for, look you, she is as white as a lily and
1030	as small as a wand: this hat is Nan, our maid: I
1031	am the dog: no, the dog is himself, and I am the
1032	dog--Oh! the dog is me, and I am myself; ay, so,
1033	so. Now come I to my father; Father, your blessing:
1034	now should not the shoe speak a word for weeping:
1035	now should I kiss my father; well, he weeps on. Now
1036	come I to my mother: O, that she could speak now
1037	like a wood woman! Well, I kiss her; why, there
1038	'tis; here's my mother's breath up and down. Now
1039	come I to my sister; mark the moan she makes. Now
1040	the dog all this while sheds not a tear nor speaks a
1041	word; but see how I lay the dust with my tears.
1042	
1043	[Enter PANTHINO]
1044	
1045	PANTHINO	Launce, away, away, aboard! thy master is shipped
1046	and thou art to post after with oars. What's the
1047	matter? why weepest thou, man? Away, ass! You'll
1048	lose the tide, if you tarry any longer.
1049	
1050	LAUNCE	It is no matter if the tied were lost; for it is the
1051	unkindest tied that ever any man tied.
1052	
1053	PANTHINO	What's the unkindest tide?
1054	
1055	LAUNCE	Why, he that's tied here, Crab, my dog.
1056	
1057	PANTHINO	Tut, man, I mean thou'lt lose the flood, and, in
1058	losing the flood, lose thy voyage, and, in losing
1059	thy voyage, lose thy master, and, in losing thy
1060	master, lose thy service, and, in losing thy
1061	service,--Why dost thou stop my mouth?
1062	
1063	LAUNCE	For fear thou shouldst lose thy tongue.
1064	
1065	PANTHINO	Where should I lose my tongue?
1066	
1067	LAUNCE	In thy tale.
1068	
1069	PANTHINO	In thy tail!
1070	
1071	LAUNCE	Lose the tide, and the voyage, and the master, and
1072	the service, and the tied! Why, man, if the river
1073	were dry, I am able to fill it with my tears; if the
1074	wind were down, I could drive the boat with my sighs.
1075	
1076	PANTHINO	Come, come away, man; I was sent to call thee.
1077	
1078	LAUNCE	Sir, call me what thou darest.
1079

1104	
1105	SPEED	Master, Sir Thurio frowns on you.
1106	
1107	VALENTINE	Ay, boy, it's for love.
1108	
1109	SPEED	Not of you.
1110	
1111	VALENTINE	Of my mistress, then.
1112	
1113	SPEED	'Twere good you knocked him.

1115	[Exit]
1116	
1117	SILVIA	Servant, you are sad.
1118	
1119	VALENTINE	Indeed, madam, I seem so.
1120	
1121	THURIO	Seem you that you are not?
1122	
1123	VALENTINE	Haply I do.
1124

1126	
1127	VALENTINE	So do you.
1128	
1129	THURIO	What seem I that I am not?
1130	
1131	VALENTINE	Wise.
1132	
1133	THURIO	What instance of the contrary?
1134	
1135	VALENTINE	Your folly.
1136	
1137	THURIO	And how quote you my folly?
1138	
1139	VALENTINE	I quote it in your jerkin.
1140	
1141	THURIO	My jerkin is a doublet.
1142

1144	
1145	THURIO	How?
1146	
1147	SILVIA	What, angry, Sir Thurio! do you change colour?
1148	
1149	VALENTINE	Give him leave, madam; he is a kind of chameleon.
1150	
1151	THURIO	That hath more mind to feed on your blood than live
1152	in your air.
1153	
1154	VALENTINE	You have said, sir.
1155	
1156	THURIO	Ay, sir, and done too, for this time.
1157	
1158	VALENTINE	I know it well, sir; you always end ere you begin.
1159	
1160	SILVIA	A fine volley of words, gentlemen, and quickly shot off.
1161	
1162	VALENTINE	'Tis indeed, madam; we thank the giver.
1163	
1164	SILVIA	Who is that, servant?
1165	
1166	VALENTINE	Yourself, sweet lady; for you gave the fire. Sir
1167	Thurio borrows his wit from your ladyship's looks,
1168	and spends what he borrows kindly in your company.
1169	
1170	THURIO	Sir, if you spend word for word with me, I shall
1171	make your wit bankrupt.
1172	
1173	VALENTINE	I know it well, sir; you have an exchequer of words,
1174	and, I think, no other treasure to give your
1175	followers, for it appears by their bare liveries,
1176	that they live by your bare words.
1177	
1178	SILVIA	No more, gentlemen, no more:--here comes my father.
1179	
1180	[Enter DUKE]
1181	
1182	DUKE	Now, daughter Silvia, you are hard beset.
1183	Sir Valentine, your father's in good health:
1184	What say you to a letter from your friends
1185	Of much good news?
1186	
1187	VALENTINE	                  My lord, I will be thankful.
1188	To any happy messenger from thence.
1189	
1190	DUKE	Know ye Don Antonio, your countryman?
1191	
1192	VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord, I know the gentleman
1193	To be of worth and worthy estimation
1194	And not without desert so well reputed.
1195	
1196	DUKE	Hath he not a son?
1197	
1198	VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord; a son that well deserves
1199	The honour and regard of such a father.
1200	
1201	DUKE	You know him well?
1202	
1203	VALENTINE	I know him as myself; for from our infancy
1204	We have conversed and spent our hours together:
1205	And though myself have been an idle truant,
1206	Omitting the sweet benefit of time
1207	To clothe mine age with angel-like perfection,
1208	Yet hath Sir Proteus, for that's his name,
1209	Made use and fair advantage of his days;
1210	His years but young, but his experience old;
1211	His head unmellow'd, but his judgment ripe;
1212	And, in a word, for far behind his worth
1213	Comes all the praises that I now bestow,
1214	He is complete in feature and in mind
1215	With all good grace to grace a gentleman.
1216	
1217	DUKE	Beshrew me, sir, but if he make this good,
1218	He is as worthy for an empress' love
1219	As meet to be an emperor's counsellor.
1220	Well, sir, this gentleman is come to me,
1221	With commendation from great potentates;
1222	And here he means to spend his time awhile:
1223	I think 'tis no unwelcome news to you.
1224	
1225	VALENTINE	Should I have wish'd a thing, it had been he.
1226	
1227	DUKE	Welcome him then according to his worth.
1228	Silvia, I speak to you, and you, Sir Thurio;
1229	For Valentine, I need not cite him to it:
1230	I will send him hither to you presently.
1231	
1232	[Exit]
1233	
1234	VALENTINE	This is the gentleman I told your ladyship
1235	Had come along with me, but that his mistress
1236	Did hold his eyes lock'd in her crystal looks.
1237	
1238	SILVIA	Belike that now she hath enfranchised them
1239	Upon some other pawn for fealty.
1240	
1241	VALENTINE	Nay, sure, I think she holds them prisoners still.
1242	
1243	SILVIA	Nay, then he should be blind; and, being blind
1244	How could he see his way to seek out you?
1245	
1246	VALENTINE	Why, lady, Love hath twenty pair of eyes.
1247	
1248	THURIO	They say that Love hath not an eye at all.
1249	
1250	VALENTINE	To see such lovers, Thurio, as yourself:
1251	Upon a homely object Love can wink.
1252	
1253	SILVIA	Have done, have done; here comes the gentleman.
1254	
1255	[Exit THURIO]
1256	
1257	[Enter PROTEUS]
1258	
1259	VALENTINE	Welcome, dear Proteus! Mistress, I beseech you,
1260	Confirm his welcome with some special favour.
1261	
1262	SILVIA	His worth is warrant for his welcome hither,
1263	If this be he you oft have wish'd to hear from.
1264	
1265	VALENTINE	Mistress, it is: sweet lady, entertain him
1266	To be my fellow-servant to your ladyship.
1267	
1268	SILVIA	Too low a mistress for so high a servant.
1269	
1270	PROTEUS	Not so, sweet lady: but too mean a servant
1271	To have a look of such a worthy mistress.
1272	
1273	VALENTINE	Leave off discourse of disability:
1274	Sweet lady, entertain him for your servant.
1275	
1276	PROTEUS	My duty will I boast of; nothing else.
1277	
1278	SILVIA	And duty never yet did want his meed:
1279	Servant, you are welcome to a worthless mistress.
1280	
1281	PROTEUS	I'll die on him that says so but yourself.
1282	
1283	SILVIA	That you are welcome?
1284	
1285	PROTEUS	That you are worthless.
1286	
1287	[Re-enter THURIO]
1288	
1289	THURIO	Madam, my lord your father would speak with you.
1290	
1291	SILVIA	I wait upon his pleasure. Come, Sir Thurio,
1292	Go with me. Once more, new servant, welcome:
1293	I'll leave you to confer of home affairs;
1294	When you have done, we look to hear from you.
1295	
1296	PROTEUS	We'll both attend upon your ladyship.
1297	
1298	[Exeunt SILVIA and THURIO]
1299	
1300	VALENTINE	Now, tell me, how do all from whence you came?
1301	
1302	PROTEUS	Your friends are well and have them much commended.
1303	
1304	VALENTINE	And how do yours?
1305	
1306	PROTEUS	                  I left them all in health.
1307	
1308	VALENTINE	How does your lady? and how thrives your love?
1309	
1310	PROTEUS	My tales of love were wont to weary you;
1311	I know you joy not in a love discourse.
1312	
1313	VALENTINE	Ay, Proteus, but that life is alter'd now:
1314	I have done penance for contemning Love,
1315	Whose high imperious thoughts have punish'd me
1316	With bitter fasts, with penitential groans,
1317	With nightly tears and daily heart-sore sighs;
1318	For in revenge of my contempt of love,
1319	Love hath chased sleep from my enthralled eyes
1320	And made them watchers of mine own heart's sorrow.
1321	O gentle Proteus, Love's a mighty lord,
1322	And hath so humbled me, as, I confess,
1323	There is no woe to his correction,
1324	Nor to his service no such joy on earth.
1325	Now no discourse, except it be of love;
1326	Now can I break my fast, dine, sup and sleep,
1327	Upon the very naked name of love.
1328	
1329	PROTEUS	Enough; I read your fortune in your eye.
1330	Was this the idol that you worship so?
1331	
1332	VALENTINE	Even she; and is she not a heavenly saint?
1333	
1334	PROTEUS	No; but she is an earthly paragon.
1335	
1336	VALENTINE	Call her divine.
1337	
1338	PROTEUS	                  I will not flatter her.
1339	
1340	VALENTINE	O, flatter me; for love delights in praises.
1341	
1342	PROTEUS	When I was sick, you gave me bitter pills,
1343	And I must minister the like to you.
1344	
1345	VALENTINE	Then speak the truth by her; if not divine,
1346	Yet let her be a principality,
1347	Sovereign to all the creatures on the earth.
1348	
1349	PROTEUS	Except my mistress.
1350	
1351	VALENTINE	Sweet, except not any;
1352	Except thou wilt except against my love.
1353	
1354	PROTEUS	Have I not reason to prefer mine own?
1355	
1356	VALENTINE	And I will help thee to prefer her too:
1357	She shall be dignified with this high honour--
1358	To bear my lady's train, lest the base earth
1359	Should from her vesture chance to steal a kiss
1360	And, of so great a favour growing proud,
1361	Disdain to root the summer-swelling flower
1362	And make rough winter everlastingly.
1363	
1364	PROTEUS	Why, Valentine, what braggardism is this?
1365	
1366	VALENTINE	Pardon me, Proteus: all I can is nothing
1367	To her whose worth makes other worthies nothing;
1368	She is alone.
1369	
1370	PROTEUS	                  Then let her alone.
1371	
1372	VALENTINE	Not for the world: why, man, she is mine own,
1373	And I as rich in having such a jewel
1374	As twenty seas, if all their sand were pearl,
1375	The water nectar and the rocks pure gold.
1376	Forgive me that I do not dream on thee,
1377	Because thou see'st me dote upon my love.
1378	My foolish rival, that her father likes
1379	Only for his possessions are so huge,
1380	Is gone with her along, and I must after,
1381	For love, thou know'st, is full of jealousy.
1382	
1383	PROTEUS	But she loves you?
1384	
1385	VALENTINE	Ay, and we are betroth'd: nay, more, our,
1386	marriage-hour,
1387	With all the cunning manner of our flight,
1388	Determined of; how I must climb her window,
1389	The ladder made of cords, and all the means
1390	Plotted and 'greed on for my happiness.
1391	Good Proteus, go with me to my chamber,
1392	In these affairs to aid me with thy counsel.
1393	
1394	PROTEUS	Go on before; I shall inquire you forth:
1395	I must unto the road, to disembark
1396	Some necessaries that I needs must use,
1397	And then I'll presently attend you.
1398	
1399	VALENTINE	Will you make haste?
1400	
1401	PROTEUS	I will.
1402	
1403	[Exit VALENTINE]
1404	
1405	Even as one heat another heat expels,
1406	Or as one nail by strength drives out another,
1407	So the remembrance of my former love
1408	Is by a newer object quite forgotten.
1409	Is it mine, or Valentine's praise,
1410	Her true perfection, or my false transgression,
1411	That makes me reasonless to reason thus?
1412	She is fair; and so is Julia that I love--
1413	That I did love, for now my love is thaw'd;
1414	Which, like a waxen image, 'gainst a fire,
1415	Bears no impression of the thing it was.
1416	Methinks my zeal to Valentine is cold,
1417	And that I love him not as I was wont.
1418	O, but I love his lady too too much,
1419	And that's the reason I love him so little.
1420	How shall I dote on her with more advice,
1421	That thus without advice begin to love her!
1422	'Tis but her picture I have yet beheld,
1423	And that hath dazzled my reason's light;
1424	But when I look on her perfections,
1425	There is no reason but I shall be blind.
1426	If I can cheque my erring love, I will;
1427	If not, to compass her I'll use my skill.

1437	ACT II
1438	
1439	
1440	
1441	SCENE V	The same. A street.
1442	
1443	
1444	[Enter SPEED and LAUNCE severally]
1445	
1446	SPEED	Launce! by mine honesty, welcome to Milan!
1447	
1448	LAUNCE	Forswear not thyself, sweet youth, for I am not
1449	welcome. I reckon this always, that a man is never
1450	undone till he be hanged, nor never welcome to a
1451	place till some certain shot be paid and the hostess
1452	say 'Welcome!'
1453	
1454	SPEED	Come on, you madcap, I'll to the alehouse with you
1455	presently; where, for one shot of five pence, thou
1456	shalt have five thousand welcomes. But, sirrah, how
1457	did thy master part with Madam Julia?
1458	
1459	LAUNCE	Marry, after they closed in earnest, they parted very
1460	fairly in jest.
1461	
1462	SPEED	But shall she marry him?
1463	
1464	LAUNCE	No.
1465	
1466	SPEED	How then? shall he marry her?
1467	
1468	LAUNCE	No, neither.
1469	
1470	SPEED	What, are they broken?
1471	
1472	LAUNCE	No, they are both as whole as a fish.
1473	
1474	SPEED	Why, then, how stands the matter with them?
1475	
1476	LAUNCE	Marry, thus: when it stands well with him, it
1477	stands well with her.
1478	
1479	SPEED	What an ass art thou! I understand thee not.
1480	
1481	LAUNCE	What a block art thou, that thou canst not! My
1482	staff understands me.
1483	
1484	SPEED	What thou sayest?
1485	
1486	LAUNCE	Ay, and what I do too: look thee, I'll but lean,
1487	and my staff understands me.
1488	
1489	SPEED	It stands under thee, indeed.
1490	
1491	LAUNCE	Why, stand-under and under-stand is all one.
1492	
1493	SPEED	But tell me true, will't be a match?
1494	
1495	LAUNCE	Ask my dog: if he say ay, it will! if he say no,
1496	it will; if he shake his tail and say nothing, it will.
1497	
1498	SPEED	The conclusion is then that it will.
1499	
1500	LAUNCE	Thou shalt never get such a secret from me but by a parable.
1501	
1502	SPEED	'Tis well that I get it so. But, Launce, how sayest
1503	thou, that my master is become a notable lover?
1504	
1505	LAUNCE	I never knew him otherwise.
1506	
1507	SPEED	Than how?
1508	
1509	LAUNCE	A notable lubber, as thou reportest him to be.
1510	
1511	SPEED	Why, thou whoreson ass, thou mistakest me.
1512	
1513	LAUNCE	Why, fool, I meant not thee; I meant thy master.
1514	
1515	SPEED	I tell thee, my master is become a hot lover.
1516	
1517	LAUNCE	Why, I tell thee, I care not though he burn himself
1518	in love. If thou wilt, go with me to the alehouse;
1519	if not, thou art an Hebrew, a Jew, and not worth the
1520	name of a Christian.
1521	
1522	SPEED	Why?
1523	
1524	LAUNCE	Because thou hast not so much charity in thee as to
1525	go to the ale with a Christian. Wilt thou go?
1526	
1527	SPEED	At thy service.

1539	
1540	
1541	SCENE VI	The same. The DUKE'S palace.
1542	
1543	
1544	[Enter PROTEUS]
1545	
1546	PROTEUS	To leave my Julia, shall I be forsworn;
1547	To love fair Silvia, shall I be forsworn;
1548	To wrong my friend, I shall be much forsworn;
1549	And even that power which gave me first my oath
1550	Provokes me to this threefold perjury;
1551	Love bade me swear and Love bids me forswear.
1552	O sweet-suggesting Love, if thou hast sinned,
1553	Teach me, thy tempted subject, to excuse it!
1554	At first I did adore a twinkling star,
1555	But now I worship a celestial sun.
1556	Unheedful vows may heedfully be broken,
1557	And he wants wit that wants resolved will
1558	To learn his wit to exchange the bad for better.
1559	Fie, fie, unreverend tongue! to call her bad,
1560	Whose sovereignty so oft thou hast preferr'd
1561	With twenty thousand soul-confirming oaths.
1562	I cannot leave to love, and yet I do;
1563	But there I leave to love where I should love.
1564	Julia I lose and Valentine I lose:
1565	If I keep them, I needs must lose myself;
1566	If I lose them, thus find I by their loss
1567	For Valentine myself, for Julia Silvia.
1568	I to myself am dearer than a friend,
1569	For love is still most precious in itself;
1570	And Silvia--witness Heaven, that made her fair!--
1571	Shows Julia but a swarthy Ethiope.
1572	I will forget that Julia is alive,
1573	Remembering that my love to her is dead;
1574	And Valentine I'll hold an enemy,
1575	Aiming at Silvia as a sweeter friend.
1576	I cannot now prove constant to myself,
1577	Without some treachery used to Valentine.
1578	This night he meaneth with a corded ladder
1579	To climb celestial Silvia's chamber-window,
1580	Myself in counsel, his competitor.
1581	Now presently I'll give her father notice
1582	Of their disguising and pretended flight;
1583	Who, all enraged, will banish Valentine;
1584	For Thurio, he intends, shall wed his daughter;
1585	But, Valentine being gone, I'll quickly cross
1586	By some sly trick blunt Thurio's dull proceeding.
1587	Love, lend me wings to make my purpose swift,
1588	As thou hast lent me wit to plot this drift!

1597	
1598	ACT II
1599	
1600	
1601	
1602	SCENE VII	Verona. JULIA'S house.
1603	
1604	
1605	[Enter JULIA and LUCETTA]
1606	
1607	JULIA	Counsel, Lucetta; gentle girl, assist me;
1608	And even in kind love I do conjure thee,
1609	Who art the table wherein all my thoughts
1610	Are visibly character'd and engraved,
1611	To lesson me and tell me some good mean
1612	How, with my honour, I may undertake
1613	A journey to my loving Proteus.
1614	
1615	LUCETTA	Alas, the way is wearisome and long!
1616	
1617	JULIA	A true-devoted pilgrim is not weary
1618	To measure kingdoms with his feeble steps;
1619	Much less shall she that hath Love's wings to fly,
1620	And when the flight is made to one so dear,
1621	Of such divine perfection, as Sir Proteus.
1622	
1623	LUCETTA	Better forbear till Proteus make return.
1624	
1625	JULIA	O, know'st thou not his looks are my soul's food?
1626	Pity the dearth that I have pined in,
1627	By longing for that food so long a time.
1628	Didst thou but know the inly touch of love,
1629	Thou wouldst as soon go kindle fire with snow
1630	As seek to quench the fire of love with words.
1631	
1632	LUCETTA	I do not seek to quench your love's hot fire,
1633	But qualify the fire's extreme rage,
1634	Lest it should burn above the bounds of reason.
1635	
1636	JULIA	The more thou damm'st it up, the more it burns.
1637	The current that with gentle murmur glides,
1638	Thou know'st, being stopp'd, impatiently doth rage;
1639	But when his fair course is not hindered,
1640	He makes sweet music with the enamell'ed stones,
1641	Giving a gentle kiss to every sedge
1642	He overtaketh in his pilgrimage,
1643	And so by many winding nooks he strays
1644	With willing sport to the wild ocean.
1645	Then let me go and hinder not my course
1646	I'll be as patient as a gentle stream
1647	And make a pastime of each weary step,
1648	Till the last step have brought me to my love;
1649	And there I'll rest, as after much turmoil
1650	A blessed soul doth in Elysium.
1651	
1652	LUCETTA	But in what habit will you go along?
1653	
1654	JULIA	Not like a woman; for I would prevent
1655	The loose encounters of lascivious men:
1656	Gentle Lucetta, fit me with such weeds
1657	As may beseem some well-reputed page.
1658	
1659	LUCETTA	Why, then, your ladyship must cut your hair.
1660	
1661	JULIA	No, girl, I'll knit it up in silken strings
1662	With twenty odd-conceited true-love knots.
1663	To be fantastic may become a youth
1664	Of greater time than I shall show to be.
1665	
1666	LUCETTA	What fashion, madam shall I make your breeches?
1667	
1668	JULIA	That fits as well as 'Tell me, good my lord,
1669	What compass will you wear your farthingale?'
1670	Why even what fashion thou best likest, Lucetta.
1671	
1672	LUCETTA	You must needs have them with a codpiece, madam.
1673	
1674	JULIA	Out, out, Lucetta! that would be ill-favour'd.
1675	
1676	LUCETTA	A round hose, madam, now's not worth a pin,
1677	Unless you have a codpiece to stick pins on.
1678	
1679	JULIA	Lucetta, as thou lovest me, let me have
1680	What thou thinkest meet and is most mannerly.
1681	But tell me, wench, how will the world repute me
1682	For undertaking so unstaid a journey?
1683	I fear me, it will make me scandalized.
1684	
1685	LUCETTA	If you think so, then stay at home and go not.
1686	
1687	JULIA	Nay, that I will not.
1688	
1689	LUCETTA	Then never dream on infamy, but go.
1690	If Proteus like your journey when you come,
1691	No matter who's displeased when you are gone:
1692	I fear me, he will scarce be pleased withal.
1693	
1694	JULIA	That is the least, Lucetta, of my fear:
1695	A thousand oaths, an ocean of his tears
1696	And instances of infinite of love
1697	Warrant me welcome to my Proteus.
1698	
1699	LUCETTA	All these are servants to deceitful men.
1700	
1701	JULIA	Base men, that use them to so base effect!
1702	But truer stars did govern Proteus' birth
1703	His words are bonds, his oaths are oracles,
1704	His love sincere, his thoughts immaculate,
1705	His tears pure messengers sent from his heart,
1706	His heart as far from fraud as heaven from earth.
1707	
1708	LUCETTA	Pray heaven he prove so, when you come to him!
1709	
1710	JULIA	Now, as thou lovest me, do him not that wrong
1711	To bear a hard opinion of his truth:
1712	Only deserve my love by loving him;
1713	And presently go with me to my chamber,
1714	To take a note of what I stand in need of,
1715	To furnish me upon my longing journey.
1716	All that is mine I leave at thy dispose,
1717	My goods, my lands, my reputation;
1718	Only, in lieu thereof, dispatch me hence.
1719	Come, answer not, but to it presently!
1720	I am impatient of my tarriance.
1721	
1722	[Exeunt]
1723

1726	
1727	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
1728	
1729	
1730	ACT III
1731	
1732	
1733	
1734	SCENE I	Milan. The DUKE's palace.
1735	
1736	
1737	[Enter DUKE, THURIO, and PROTEUS]
1738	
1739	DUKE	Sir Thurio, give us leave, I pray, awhile;
1740	We have some secrets to confer about.
1741	
1742	[Exit THURIO]
1743	
1744	Now, tell me, Proteus, what's your will with me?
1745	
1746	PROTEUS	My gracious lord, that which I would discover
1747	The law of friendship bids me to conceal;
1748	But when I call to mind your gracious favours
1749	Done to me, undeserving as I am,
1750	My duty pricks me on to utter that
1751	Which else no worldly good should draw from me.
1752	Know, worthy prince, Sir Valentine, my friend,
1753	This night intends to steal away your daughter:
1754	Myself am one made privy to the plot.
1755	I know you have determined to bestow her
1756	On Thurio, whom your gentle daughter hates;
1757	And should she thus be stol'n away from you,
1758	It would be much vexation to your age.
1759	Thus, for my duty's sake, I rather chose
1760	To cross my friend in his intended drift
1761	Than, by concealing it, heap on your head
1762	A pack of sorrows which would press you down,
1763	Being unprevented, to your timeless grave.
1764	
1765	DUKE	Proteus, I thank thee for thine honest care;
1766	Which to requite, command me while I live.
1767	This love of theirs myself have often seen,
1768	Haply when they have judged me fast asleep,
1769	And oftentimes have purposed to forbid
1770	Sir Valentine her company and my court:
1771	But fearing lest my jealous aim might err
1772	And so unworthily disgrace the man,
1773	A rashness that I ever yet have shunn'd,
1774	I gave him gentle looks, thereby to find
1775	That which thyself hast now disclosed to me.
1776	And, that thou mayst perceive my fear of this,
1777	Knowing that tender youth is soon suggested,
1778	I nightly lodge her in an upper tower,
1779	The key whereof myself have ever kept;
1780	And thence she cannot be convey'd away.
1781	
1782	PROTEUS	Know, noble lord, they have devised a mean
1783	How he her chamber-window will ascend
1784	And with a corded ladder fetch her down;
1785	For which the youthful lover now is gone
1786	And this way comes he with it presently;
1787	Where, if it please you, you may intercept him.
1788	But, good my Lord, do it so cunningly
1789	That my discovery be not aimed at;
1790	For love of you, not hate unto my friend,
1791	Hath made me publisher of this pretence.
1792	
1793	DUKE	Upon mine honour, he shall never know
1794	That I had any light from thee of this.
1795	
1796	PROTEUS	Adieu, my Lord; Sir Valentine is coming.
1797	
1798	[Exit]
1799	
1800	[Enter VALENTINE]
1801	
1802	DUKE	Sir Valentine, whither away so fast?
1803	
1804	VALENTINE	Please it your grace, there is a messenger
1805	That stays to bear my letters to my friends,
1806	And I am going to deliver them.
1807	
1808	DUKE	Be they of much import?
1809	
1810	VALENTINE	The tenor of them doth but signify
1811	My health and happy being at your court.
1812	
1813	DUKE	Nay then, no matter; stay with me awhile;
1814	I am to break with thee of some affairs
1815	That touch me near, wherein thou must be secret.
1816	'Tis not unknown to thee that I have sought
1817	To match my friend Sir Thurio to my daughter.
1818	
1819	VALENTINE	I know it well, my Lord; and, sure, the match
1820	Were rich and honourable; besides, the gentleman
1821	Is full of virtue, bounty, worth and qualities
1822	Beseeming such a wife as your fair daughter:
1823	Cannot your Grace win her to fancy him?
1824	
1825	DUKE	No, trust me; she is peevish, sullen, froward,
1826	Proud, disobedient, stubborn, lacking duty,
1827	Neither regarding that she is my child
1828	Nor fearing me as if I were her father;
1829	And, may I say to thee, this pride of hers,
1830	Upon advice, hath drawn my love from her;
1831	And, where I thought the remnant of mine age
1832	Should have been cherish'd by her child-like duty,
1833	I now am full resolved to take a wife
1834	And turn her out to who will take her in:
1835	Then let her beauty be her wedding-dower;
1836	For me and my possessions she esteems not.
1837	
1838	VALENTINE	What would your Grace have me to do in this?
1839	
1840	DUKE	There is a lady in Verona here
1841	Whom I affect; but she is nice and coy
1842	And nought esteems my aged eloquence:
1843	Now therefore would I have thee to my tutor--
1844	For long agone I have forgot to court;
1845	Besides, the fashion of the time is changed--
1846	How and which way I may bestow myself
1847	To be regarded in her sun-bright eye.
1848	
1849	VALENTINE	Win her with gifts, if she respect not words:
1850	Dumb jewels often in their silent kind
1851	More than quick words do move a woman's mind.
1852	
1853	DUKE	But she did scorn a present that I sent her.
1854	
1855	VALENTINE	A woman sometimes scorns what best contents her.
1856	Send her another; never give her o'er;
1857	For scorn at first makes after-love the more.
1858	If she do frown, 'tis not in hate of you,
1859	But rather to beget more love in you:
1860	If she do chide, 'tis not to have you gone;
1861	For why, the fools are mad, if left alone.
1862	Take no repulse, whatever she doth say;
1863	For 'get you gone,' she doth not mean 'away!'
1864	Flatter and praise, commend, extol their graces;
1865	Though ne'er so black, say they have angels' faces.
1866	That man that hath a tongue, I say, is no man,
1867	If with his tongue he cannot win a woman.
1868	
1869	DUKE	But she I mean is promised by her friends
1870	Unto a youthful gentleman of worth,
1871	And kept severely from resort of men,
1872	That no man hath access by day to her.
1873	
1874	VALENTINE	Why, then, I would resort to her by night.
1875	
1876	DUKE	Ay, but the doors be lock'd and keys kept safe,
1877	That no man hath recourse to her by night.
1878	
1879	VALENTINE	What lets but one may enter at her window?
1880	
1881	DUKE	Her chamber is aloft, far from the ground,
1882	And built so shelving that one cannot climb it
1883	Without apparent hazard of his life.
1884	
1885	VALENTINE	Why then, a ladder quaintly made of cords,
1886	To cast up, with a pair of anchoring hooks,
1887	Would serve to scale another Hero's tower,
1888	So bold Leander would adventure it.
1889	
1890	DUKE	Now, as thou art a gentleman of blood,
1891	Advise me where I may have such a ladder.
1892	
1893	VALENTINE	When would you use it? pray, sir, tell me that.
1894	
1895	DUKE	This very night; for Love is like a child,
1896	That longs for every thing that he can come by.
1897	
1898	VALENTINE	By seven o'clock I'll get you such a ladder.
1899	
1900	DUKE	But, hark thee; I will go to her alone:
1901	How shall I best convey the ladder thither?
1902	
1903	VALENTINE	It will be light, my lord, that you may bear it
1904	Under a cloak that is of any length.
1905	
1906	DUKE	A cloak as long as thine will serve the turn?
1907	
1908	VALENTINE	Ay, my good lord.
1909	
1910	DUKE	                  Then let me see thy cloak:
1911	I'll get me one of such another length.
1912	
1913	VALENTINE	Why, any cloak will serve the turn, my lord.
1914	
1915	DUKE	How shall I fashion me to wear a cloak?
1916	I pray thee, let me feel thy cloak upon me.
1917	What letter is this same? What's here? 'To Silvia'!
1918	And here an engine fit for my proceeding.
1919	I'll be so bold to break the seal for once.
1920	
1921	[Reads]
1922	
1923	'My thoughts do harbour with my Silvia nightly,
1924	And slaves they are to me that send them flying:
1925	O, could their master come and go as lightly,
1926	Himself would lodge where senseless they are lying!
1927	My herald thoughts in thy pure bosom rest them:
1928	While I, their king, that hither them importune,
1929	Do curse the grace that with such grace hath bless'd them,
1930	Because myself do want my servants' fortune:
1931	I curse myself, for they are sent by me,
1932	That they should harbour where their lord would be.'
1933	What's here?
1934	'Silvia, this night I will enfranchise thee.'
1935	'Tis so; and here's the ladder for the purpose.
1936	Why, Phaeton,--for thou art Merops' son,--
1937	Wilt thou aspire to guide the heavenly car
1938	And with thy daring folly burn the world?
1939	Wilt thou reach stars, because they shine on thee?
1940	Go, base intruder! overweening slave!
1941	Bestow thy fawning smiles on equal mates,
1942	And think my patience, more than thy desert,
1943	Is privilege for thy departure hence:
1944	Thank me for this more than for all the favours
1945	Which all too much I have bestow'd on thee.
1946	But if thou linger in my territories
1947	Longer than swiftest expedition
1948	Will give thee time to leave our royal court,
1949	By heaven! my wrath shall far exceed the love
1950	I ever bore my daughter or thyself.
1951	Be gone! I will not hear thy vain excuse;
1952	But, as thou lovest thy life, make speed from hence.
1953	
1954	[Exit]
1955	
1956	VALENTINE	And why not death rather than living torment?
1957	To die is to be banish'd from myself;
1958	And Silvia is myself: banish'd from her
1959	Is self from self: a deadly banishment!
1960	What light is light, if Silvia be not seen?
1961	What joy is joy, if Silvia be not by?
1962	Unless it be to think that she is by
1963	And feed upon the shadow of perfection
1964	Except I be by Silvia in the night,
1965	There is no music in the nightingale;
1966	Unless I look on Silvia in the day,
1967	There is no day for me to look upon;
1968	She is my essence, and I leave to be,
1969	If I be not by her fair influence
1970	Foster'd, illumined, cherish'd, kept alive.
1971	I fly not death, to fly his deadly doom:
1972	Tarry I here, I but attend on death:
1973	But, fly I hence, I fly away from life.
1974	
1975	[Enter PROTEUS and LAUNCE]
1976	
1977	PROTEUS	Run, boy, run, run, and seek him out.
1978	
1979	LAUNCE	Soho, soho!
1980	
1981	PROTEUS	What seest thou?
1982	
1983	LAUNCE	Him we go to find: there's not a hair on's head
1984	but 'tis a Valentine.
1985	
1986	PROTEUS	Valentine?
1987	
1988	VALENTINE	No.
1989	
1990	PROTEUS	Who then? his spirit?
1991	
1992	VALENTINE	Neither.
1993	
1994	PROTEUS	What then?
1995	
1996	VALENTINE	Nothing.
1997	
1998	LAUNCE	Can nothing speak? Master, shall I strike?
1999	
2000	PROTEUS	Who wouldst thou strike?
2001	
2002	LAUNCE	Nothing.
2003	
2004	PROTEUS	Villain, forbear.
2005	
2006	LAUNCE	Why, sir, I'll strike nothing: I pray you,--
2007	
2008	PROTEUS	Sirrah, I say, forbear. Friend Valentine, a word.
2009	
2010	VALENTINE	My ears are stopt and cannot hear good news,
2011	So much of bad already hath possess'd them.
2012	
2013	PROTEUS	Then in dumb silence will I bury mine,
2014	For they are harsh, untuneable and bad.
2015	
2016	VALENTINE	Is Silvia dead?
2017	
2018	PROTEUS	No, Valentine.
2019	
2020	VALENTINE	No Valentine, indeed, for sacred Silvia.
2021	Hath she forsworn me?
2022	
2023	PROTEUS	No, Valentine.
2024	
2025	VALENTINE	No Valentine, if Silvia have forsworn me.
2026	What is your news?
2027	
2028	LAUNCE	Sir, there is a proclamation that you are vanished.
2029	
2030	PROTEUS	That thou art banished--O, that's the news!--
2031	From hence, from Silvia and from me thy friend.
2032	
2033	VALENTINE	O, I have fed upon this woe already,
2034	And now excess of it will make me surfeit.
2035	Doth Silvia know that I am banished?
2036	
2037	PROTEUS	Ay, ay; and she hath offer'd to the doom--
2038	Which, unreversed, stands in effectual force--
2039	A sea of melting pearl, which some call tears:
2040	Those at her father's churlish feet she tender'd;
2041	With them, upon her knees, her humble self;
2042	Wringing her hands, whose whiteness so became them
2043	As if but now they waxed pale for woe:
2044	But neither bended knees, pure hands held up,
2045	Sad sighs, deep groans, nor silver-shedding tears,
2046	Could penetrate her uncompassionate sire;
2047	But Valentine, if he be ta'en, must die.
2048	Besides, her intercession chafed him so,
2049	When she for thy repeal was suppliant,
2050	That to close prison he commanded her,
2051	With many bitter threats of biding there.
2052	
2053	VALENTINE	No more; unless the next word that thou speak'st
2054	Have some malignant power upon my life:
2055	If so, I pray thee, breathe it in mine ear,
2056	As ending anthem of my endless dolour.
2057	
2058	PROTEUS	Cease to lament for that thou canst not help,
2059	And study help for that which thou lament'st.
2060	Time is the nurse and breeder of all good.
2061	Here if thou stay, thou canst not see thy love;
2062	Besides, thy staying will abridge thy life.
2063	Hope is a lover's staff; walk hence with that
2064	And manage it against despairing thoughts.
2065	Thy letters may be here, though thou art hence;
2066	Which, being writ to me, shall be deliver'd
2067	Even in the milk-white bosom of thy love.
2068	The time now serves not to expostulate:
2069	Come, I'll convey thee through the city-gate;
2070	And, ere I part with thee, confer at large
2071	Of all that may concern thy love-affairs.
2072	As thou lovest Silvia, though not for thyself,
2073	Regard thy danger, and along with me!
2074	
2075	VALENTINE	I pray thee, Launce, an if thou seest my boy,
2076	Bid him make haste and meet me at the North-gate.
2077	
2078	PROTEUS	Go, sirrah, find him out. Come, Valentine.
2079	
2080	VALENTINE	O my dear Silvia! Hapless Valentine!
2081	
2082	[Exeunt VALENTINE and PROTEUS]
2083	
2084	LAUNCE	I am but a fool, look you; and yet I have the wit to
2085	think my master is a kind of a knave: but that's
2086	all one, if he be but one knave. He lives not now
2087	that knows me to be in love; yet I am in love; but a
2088	team of horse shall not pluck that from me; nor who
2089	'tis I love; and yet 'tis a woman; but what woman, I
2090	will not tell myself; and yet 'tis a milkmaid; yet
2091	'tis not a maid, for she hath had gossips; yet 'tis
2092	a maid, for she is her master's maid, and serves for
2093	wages. She hath more qualities than a water-spaniel;
2094	which is much in a bare Christian.
2095	
2096	[Pulling out a paper]
2097	
2098	Here is the cate-log of her condition.
2099	'Imprimis: She can fetch and carry.' Why, a horse
2100	can do no more: nay, a horse cannot fetch, but only
2101	carry; therefore is she better than a jade. 'Item:
2102	She can milk;' look you, a sweet virtue in a maid
2103	with clean hands.
2104	
2105	[Enter SPEED]
2106	
2107	SPEED	How now, Signior Launce! what news with your
2108	mastership?
2109	
2110	LAUNCE	With my master's ship? why, it is at sea.
2111	
2112	SPEED	Well, your old vice still; mistake the word. What
2113	news, then, in your paper?
2114	
2115	LAUNCE	The blackest news that ever thou heardest.
2116	
2117	SPEED	Why, man, how black?
2118	
2119	LAUNCE	Why, as black as ink.
2120	
2121	SPEED	Let me read them.
2122	
2123	LAUNCE	Fie on thee, jolt-head! thou canst not read.
2124	
2125	SPEED	Thou liest; I can.
2126	
2127	LAUNCE	I will try thee. Tell me this: who begot thee?
2128	
2129	SPEED	Marry, the son of my grandfather.
2130	
2131	LAUNCE	O illiterate loiterer! it was the son of thy
2132	grandmother: this proves that thou canst not read.
2133	
2134	SPEED	Come, fool, come; try me in thy paper.
2135	
2136	LAUNCE	There; and St. Nicholas be thy speed!
2137	
2138	SPEED	[Reads]  'Imprimis: She can milk.'
2139	
2140	LAUNCE	Ay, that she can.
2141	
2142	SPEED	'Item: She brews good ale.'
2143	
2144	LAUNCE	And thereof comes the proverb: 'Blessing of your
2145	heart, you brew good ale.'
2146	
2147	SPEED	'Item: She can sew.'
2148	
2149	LAUNCE	That's as much as to say, Can she so?
2150	
2151	SPEED	'Item: She can knit.'
2152	
2153	LAUNCE	What need a man care for a stock with a wench, when
2154	she can knit him a stock?
2155	
2156	SPEED	'Item: She can wash and scour.'
2157	
2158	LAUNCE	A special virtue: for then she need not be washed
2159	and scoured.
2160	
2161	SPEED	'Item: She can spin.'
2162	
2163	LAUNCE	Then may I set the world on wheels, when she can
2164	spin for her living.
2165	
2166	SPEED	'Item: She hath many nameless virtues.'
2167	
2168	LAUNCE	That's as much as to say, bastard virtues; that,
2169	indeed, know not their fathers and therefore have no names.
2170	
2171	SPEED	'Here follow her vices.'
2172	
2173	LAUNCE	Close at the heels of her virtues.
2174	
2175	SPEED	'Item: She is not to be kissed fasting in respect
2176	of her breath.'
2177	
2178	LAUNCE	Well, that fault may be mended with a breakfast. Read on.
2179	
2180	SPEED	'Item: She hath a sweet mouth.'
2181	
2182	LAUNCE	That makes amends for her sour breath.
2183	
2184	SPEED	'Item: She doth talk in her sleep.'
2185	
2186	LAUNCE	It's no matter for that, so she sleep not in her talk.
2187	
2188	SPEED	'Item: She is slow in words.'
2189	
2190	LAUNCE	O villain, that set this down among her vices! To
2191	be slow in words is a woman's only virtue: I pray
2192	thee, out with't, and place it for her chief virtue.
2193	
2194	SPEED	'Item: She is proud.'
2195	
2196	LAUNCE	Out with that too; it was Eve's legacy, and cannot
2197	be ta'en from her.
2198	
2199	SPEED	'Item: She hath no teeth.'
2200	
2201	LAUNCE	I care not for that neither, because I love crusts.
2202	
2203	SPEED	'Item: She is curst.'
2204	
2205	LAUNCE	Well, the best is, she hath no teeth to bite.
2206	
2207	SPEED	'Item: She will often praise her liquor.'
2208	
2209	LAUNCE	If her liquor be good, she shall: if she will not, I
2210	will; for good things should be praised.
2211	
2212	SPEED	'Item: She is too liberal.'
2213	
2214	LAUNCE	Of her tongue she cannot, for that's writ down she
2215	is slow of; of her purse she shall not, for that
2216	I'll keep shut: now, of another thing she may, and
2217	that cannot I help. Well, proceed.
2218	
2219	SPEED	'Item: She hath more hair than wit, and more faults
2220	than hairs, and more wealth than faults.'
2221	
2222	LAUNCE	Stop there; I'll have her: she was mine, and not
2223	mine, twice or thrice in that last article.
2224	Rehearse that once more.
2225	
2226	SPEED	'Item: She hath more hair than wit,'--
2227	
2228	LAUNCE	More hair than wit? It may be; I'll prove it. The
2229	cover of the salt hides the salt, and therefore it
2230	is more than the salt; the hair that covers the wit
2231	is more than the wit, for the greater hides the
2232	less. What's next?
2233	
2234	SPEED	'And more faults than hairs,'--
2235	
2236	LAUNCE	That's monstrous: O, that that were out!
2237	
2238	SPEED	'And more wealth than faults.'
2239	
2240	LAUNCE	Why, that word makes the faults gracious. Well,
2241	I'll have her; and if it be a match, as nothing is
2242	impossible,--
2243	
2244	SPEED	What then?
2245	
2246	LAUNCE	Why, then will I tell thee--that thy master stays
2247	for thee at the North-gate.
2248	
2249	SPEED	For me?
2250	
2251	LAUNCE	For thee! ay, who art thou? he hath stayed for a
2252	better man than thee.
2253	
2254	SPEED	And must I go to him?
2255	
2256	LAUNCE	Thou must run to him, for thou hast stayed so long
2257	that going will scarce serve the turn.
2258	
2259	SPEED	Why didst not tell me sooner? pox of your love letters!
2260	
2261	[Exit]
2262	
2263	LAUNCE	Now will he be swinged for reading my letter; an
2264	unmannerly slave, that will thrust himself into
2265	secrets! I'll after, to rejoice in the boy's correction.
2266	
2267	[Exit]

2272	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
2273	
2274	
2275	ACT III
2276	
2277	
2278	
2279	SCENE II	The same. The DUKE's palace.
2280	
2281	
2282	[Enter DUKE and THURIO]
2283	
2284	DUKE	Sir Thurio, fear not but that she will love you,
2285	Now Valentine is banish'd from her sight.
2286	
2287	THURIO	Since his exile she hath despised me most,
2288	Forsworn my company and rail'd at me,
2289	That I am desperate of obtaining her.
2290	
2291	DUKE	This weak impress of love is as a figure
2292	Trenched in ice, which with an hour's heat
2293	Dissolves to water and doth lose his form.
2294	A little time will melt her frozen thoughts
2295	And worthless Valentine shall be forgot.
2296	
2297	[Enter PROTEUS]
2298	
2299	How now, Sir Proteus! Is your countryman
2300	According to our proclamation gone?
2301	
2302	PROTEUS	Gone, my good lord.
2303	
2304	DUKE	My daughter takes his going grievously.
2305	
2306	PROTEUS	A little time, my lord, will kill that grief.
2307	
2308	DUKE	So I believe; but Thurio thinks not so.
2309	Proteus, the good conceit I hold of thee--
2310	For thou hast shown some sign of good desert--
2311	Makes me the better to confer with thee.
2312	
2313	PROTEUS	Longer than I prove loyal to your grace
2314	Let me not live to look upon your grace.
2315	
2316	DUKE	Thou know'st how willingly I would effect
2317	The match between Sir Thurio and my daughter.
2318	
2319	PROTEUS	I do, my lord.
2320	
2321	DUKE	And also, I think, thou art not ignorant
2322	How she opposes her against my will
2323	
2324	PROTEUS	She did, my lord, when Valentine was here.
2325	
2326	DUKE	Ay, and perversely she persevers so.
2327	What might we do to make the girl forget
2328	The love of Valentine and love Sir Thurio?
2329	
2330	PROTEUS	The best way is to slander Valentine
2331	With falsehood, cowardice and poor descent,
2332	Three things that women highly hold in hate.
2333	
2334	DUKE	Ay, but she'll think that it is spoke in hate.
2335	
2336	PROTEUS	Ay, if his enemy deliver it:
2337	Therefore it must with circumstance be spoken
2338	By one whom she esteemeth as his friend.
2339	
2340	DUKE	Then you must undertake to slander him.
2341	
2342	PROTEUS	And that, my lord, I shall be loath to do:
2343	'Tis an ill office for a gentleman,
2344	Especially against his very friend.
2345	
2346	DUKE	Where your good word cannot advantage him,
2347	Your slander never can endamage him;
2348	Therefore the office is indifferent,
2349	Being entreated to it by your friend.
2350	
2351	PROTEUS	You have prevail'd, my lord; if I can do it
2352	By ought that I can speak in his dispraise,
2353	She shall not long continue love to him.
2354	But say this weed her love from Valentine,
2355	It follows not that she will love Sir Thurio.
2356	
2357	THURIO	Therefore, as you unwind her love from him,
2358	Lest it should ravel and be good to none,
2359	You must provide to bottom it on me;
2360	Which must be done by praising me as much
2361	As you in worth dispraise Sir Valentine.
2362	
2363	DUKE	And, Proteus, we dare trust you in this kind,
2364	Because we know, on Valentine's report,
2365	You are already Love's firm votary
2366	And cannot soon revolt and change your mind.
2367	Upon this warrant shall you have access
2368	Where you with Silvia may confer at large;
2369	For she is lumpish, heavy, melancholy,
2370	And, for your friend's sake, will be glad of you;
2371	Where you may temper her by your persuasion
2372	To hate young Valentine and love my friend.
2373	
2374	PROTEUS	As much as I can do, I will effect:
2375	But you, Sir Thurio, are not sharp enough;
2376	You must lay lime to tangle her desires
2377	By wailful sonnets, whose composed rhymes
2378	Should be full-fraught with serviceable vows.
2379	
2380	DUKE	Ay,
2381	Much is the force of heaven-bred poesy.
2382	
2383	PROTEUS	Say that upon the altar of her beauty
2384	You sacrifice your tears, your sighs, your heart:
2385	Write till your ink be dry, and with your tears
2386	Moist it again, and frame some feeling line
2387	That may discover such integrity:
2388	For Orpheus' lute was strung with poets' sinews,
2389	Whose golden touch could soften steel and stones,
2390	Make tigers tame and huge leviathans
2391	Forsake unsounded deeps to dance on sands.
2392	After your dire-lamenting elegies,
2393	Visit by night your lady's chamber-window
2394	With some sweet concert; to their instruments
2395	Tune a deploring dump: the night's dead silence
2396	Will well become such sweet-complaining grievance.
2397	This, or else nothing, will inherit her.
2398	
2399	DUKE	This discipline shows thou hast been in love.
2400	
2401	THURIO	And thy advice this night I'll put in practise.
2402	Therefore, sweet Proteus, my direction-giver,
2403	Let us into the city presently
2404	To sort some gentlemen well skill'd in music.
2405	I have a sonnet that will serve the turn
2406	To give the onset to thy good advice.
2407	
2408	DUKE	About it, gentlemen!
2409	
2410	PROTEUS	We'll wait upon your grace till after supper,
2411	And afterward determine our proceedings.
2412	
2413	DUKE	Even now about it! I will pardon you.
2414	
2415	[Exeunt]

2420	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
2421	
2422	
2423	ACT IV
2424	
2425	
2426	
2427	SCENE I	The frontiers of Mantua. A forest.
2428	
2429	
2430	[Enter certain Outlaws]
2431	
2432	First Outlaw	Fellows, stand fast; I see a passenger.
2433	
2434	Second Outlaw	If there be ten, shrink not, but down with 'em.
2435	
2436	[Enter VALENTINE and SPEED]
2437	
2438	Third Outlaw	Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about ye:
2439	If not: we'll make you sit and rifle you.
2440	
2441	SPEED	Sir, we are undone; these are the villains
2442	That all the travellers do fear so much.
2443	
2444	VALENTINE	My friends,--
2445	
2446	First Outlaw	That's not so, sir: we are your enemies.
2447	
2448	Second Outlaw	Peace! we'll hear him.
2449	
2450	Third Outlaw	Ay, by my beard, will we, for he's a proper man.
2451	
2452	VALENTINE	Then know that I have little wealth to lose:
2453	A man I am cross'd with adversity;
2454	My riches are these poor habiliments,
2455	Of which if you should here disfurnish me,
2456	You take the sum and substance that I have.
2457	
2458	Second Outlaw	Whither travel you?
2459	
2460	VALENTINE	To Verona.
2461	
2462	First Outlaw	Whence came you?
2463	
2464	VALENTINE	From Milan.
2465	
2466	Third Outlaw	Have you long sojourned there?
2467	
2468	VALENTINE	Some sixteen months, and longer might have stay'd,
2469	If crooked fortune had not thwarted me.
2470	
2471	First Outlaw	What, were you banish'd thence?
2472	
2473	VALENTINE	I was.
2474	
2475	Second Outlaw	For what offence?
2476	
2477	VALENTINE	For that which now torments me to rehearse:
2478	I kill'd a man, whose death I much repent;
2479	But yet I slew him manfully in fight,
2480	Without false vantage or base treachery.
2481	
2482	First Outlaw	Why, ne'er repent it, if it were done so.
2483	But were you banish'd for so small a fault?
2484	
2485	VALENTINE	I was, and held me glad of such a doom.
2486	
2487	Second Outlaw	Have you the tongues?
2488	
2489	VALENTINE	My youthful travel therein made me happy,
2490	Or else I often had been miserable.
2491	
2492	Third Outlaw	By the bare scalp of Robin Hood's fat friar,
2493	This fellow were a king for our wild faction!
2494	
2495	First Outlaw	We'll have him. Sirs, a word.
2496	
2497	SPEED	Master, be one of them; it's an honourable kind of thievery.
2498	
2499	VALENTINE	Peace, villain!
2500	
2501	Second Outlaw	Tell us this: have you any thing to take to?
2502	
2503	VALENTINE	Nothing but my fortune.
2504	
2505	Third Outlaw	Know, then, that some of us are gentlemen,
2506	Such as the fury of ungovern'd youth
2507	Thrust from the company of awful men:
2508	Myself was from Verona banished
2509	For practising to steal away a lady,
2510	An heir, and near allied unto the duke.
2511	
2512	Second Outlaw	And I from Mantua, for a gentleman,
2513	Who, in my mood, I stabb'd unto the heart.
2514	
2515	First Outlaw	And I for such like petty crimes as these,
2516	But to the purpose--for we cite our faults,
2517	That they may hold excus'd our lawless lives;
2518	And partly, seeing you are beautified
2519	With goodly shape and by your own report
2520	A linguist and a man of such perfection
2521	As we do in our quality much want--
2522	
2523	Second Outlaw	Indeed, because you are a banish'd man,
2524	Therefore, above the rest, we parley to you:
2525	Are you content to be our general?
2526	To make a virtue of necessity
2527	And live, as we do, in this wilderness?
2528	
2529	Third Outlaw	What say'st thou? wilt thou be of our consort?
2530	Say ay, and be the captain of us all:
2531	We'll do thee homage and be ruled by thee,
2532	Love thee as our commander and our king.
2533	
2534	First Outlaw	But if thou scorn our courtesy, thou diest.
2535	
2536	Second Outlaw	Thou shalt not live to brag what we have offer'd.
2537	
2538	VALENTINE	I take your offer and will live with you,
2539	Provided that you do no outrages
2540	On silly women or poor passengers.
2541	
2542	Third Outlaw	No, we detest such vile base practises.
2543	Come, go with us, we'll bring thee to our crews,
2544	And show thee all the treasure we have got,
2545	Which, with ourselves, all rest at thy dispose.
2546	
2547	[Exeunt]

2552	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
2553	
2554	
2555	ACT IV
2556	
2557	
2558	
2559	SCENE II	Milan. Outside the DUKE's palace, under SILVIA's chamber.
2560	
2561	
2562	[Enter PROTEUS]
2563	
2564	PROTEUS	Already have I been false to Valentine
2565	And now I must be as unjust to Thurio.
2566	Under the colour of commending him,
2567	I have access my own love to prefer:
2568	But Silvia is too fair, too true, too holy,
2569	To be corrupted with my worthless gifts.
2570	When I protest true loyalty to her,
2571	She twits me with my falsehood to my friend;
2572	When to her beauty I commend my vows,
2573	She bids me think how I have been forsworn
2574	In breaking faith with Julia whom I loved:
2575	And notwithstanding all her sudden quips,
2576	The least whereof would quell a lover's hope,
2577	Yet, spaniel-like, the more she spurns my love,
2578	The more it grows and fawneth on her still.
2579	But here comes Thurio: now must we to her window,
2580	And give some evening music to her ear.
2581	
2582	[Enter THURIO and Musicians]
2583	
2584	THURIO	How now, Sir Proteus, are you crept before us?
2585	
2586	PROTEUS	Ay, gentle Thurio: for you know that love
2587	Will creep in service where it cannot go.
2588	
2589	THURIO	Ay, but I hope, sir, that you love not here.
2590	
2591	PROTEUS	Sir, but I do; or else I would be hence.
2592	
2593	THURIO	Who? Silvia?
2594	
2595	PROTEUS	                  Ay, Silvia; for your sake.
2596	
2597	THURIO	I thank you for your own. Now, gentlemen,
2598	Let's tune, and to it lustily awhile.
2599	
2600	[Enter, at a distance, Host, and JULIA in boy's clothes]
2601	
2602	Host	Now, my young guest, methinks you're allycholly: I
2603	pray you, why is it?
2604	
2605	JULIA	Marry, mine host, because I cannot be merry.
2606	
2607	Host	Come, we'll have you merry: I'll bring you where
2608	you shall hear music and see the gentleman that you asked for.
2609	
2610	JULIA	But shall I hear him speak?
2611	
2612	Host	Ay, that you shall.
2613	
2614	JULIA	That will be music.
2615	
2616	[Music plays]
2617	
2618	Host	Hark, hark!
2619	
2620	JULIA	Is he among these?
2621	
2622	Host	Ay: but, peace! let's hear 'em.
2623	
2624	SONG.
2625	Who is Silvia? what is she,
2626	That all our swains commend her?
2627	Holy, fair and wise is she;
2628	The heaven such grace did lend her,
2629	That she might admired be.
2630	
2631	Is she kind as she is fair?
2632	For beauty lives with kindness.
2633	Love doth to her eyes repair,
2634	To help him of his blindness,
2635	And, being help'd, inhabits there.
2636	
2637	Then to Silvia let us sing,
2638	That Silvia is excelling;
2639	She excels each mortal thing
2640	Upon the dull earth dwelling:
2641	To her let us garlands bring.
2642	
2643	Host	How now! are you sadder than you were before? How
2644	do you, man? the music likes you not.
2645	
2646	JULIA	You mistake; the musician likes me not.
2647	
2648	Host	Why, my pretty youth?
2649	
2650	JULIA	He plays false, father.
2651	
2652	Host	How? out of tune on the strings?
2653	
2654	JULIA	Not so; but yet so false that he grieves my very
2655	heart-strings.
2656	
2657	Host	You have a quick ear.
2658	
2659	JULIA	Ay, I would I were deaf; it makes me have a slow heart.
2660	
2661	Host	I perceive you delight not in music.
2662	
2663	JULIA	Not a whit, when it jars so.
2664	
2665	Host	Hark, what fine change is in the music!
2666	
2667	JULIA	Ay, that change is the spite.
2668	
2669	Host	You would have them always play but one thing?
2670	
2671	JULIA	I would always have one play but one thing.
2672	But, host, doth this Sir Proteus that we talk on
2673	Often resort unto this gentlewoman?
2674	
2675	Host	I tell you what Launce, his man, told me: he loved
2676	her out of all nick.
2677	
2678	JULIA	Where is Launce?
2679	
2680	Host	Gone to seek his dog; which tomorrow, by his
2681	master's command, he must carry for a present to his lady.
2682	
2683	JULIA	Peace! stand aside: the company parts.
2684	
2685	PROTEUS	Sir Thurio, fear not you: I will so plead
2686	That you shall say my cunning drift excels.
2687	
2688	THURIO	Where meet we?
2689	
2690	PROTEUS	                  At Saint Gregory's well.
2691	
2692	THURIO	Farewell.
2693	
2694	[Exeunt THURIO and Musicians]
2695	
2696	[Enter SILVIA above]
2697	
2698	PROTEUS	Madam, good even to your ladyship.
2699	
2700	SILVIA	I thank you for your music, gentlemen.
2701	Who is that that spake?
2702	
2703	PROTEUS	One, lady, if you knew his pure heart's truth,
2704	You would quickly learn to know him by his voice.
2705	
2706	SILVIA	Sir Proteus, as I take it.
2707	
2708	PROTEUS	Sir Proteus, gentle lady, and your servant.
2709	
2710	SILVIA	What's your will?
2711	
2712	PROTEUS	                  That I may compass yours.
2713	
2714	SILVIA	You have your wish; my will is even this:
2715	That presently you hie you home to bed.
2716	Thou subtle, perjured, false, disloyal man!
2717	Think'st thou I am so shallow, so conceitless,
2718	To be seduced by thy flattery,
2719	That hast deceived so many with thy vows?
2720	Return, return, and make thy love amends.
2721	For me, by this pale queen of night I swear,
2722	I am so far from granting thy request
2723	That I despise thee for thy wrongful suit,
2724	And by and by intend to chide myself
2725	Even for this time I spend in talking to thee.
2726	
2727	PROTEUS	I grant, sweet love, that I did love a lady;
2728	But she is dead.
2729	
2730	JULIA	[Aside]        'Twere false, if I should speak it;
2731	For I am sure she is not buried.
2732	
2733	SILVIA	Say that she be; yet Valentine thy friend
2734	Survives; to whom, thyself art witness,
2735	I am betroth'd: and art thou not ashamed
2736	To wrong him with thy importunacy?
2737	
2738	PROTEUS	I likewise hear that Valentine is dead.
2739	
2740	SILVIA	And so suppose am I; for in his grave
2741	Assure thyself my love is buried.
2742	
2743	PROTEUS	Sweet lady, let me rake it from the earth.
2744	
2745	SILVIA	Go to thy lady's grave and call hers thence,
2746	Or, at the least, in hers sepulchre thine.
2747	
2748	JULIA	[Aside]  He heard not that.
2749	
2750	PROTEUS	Madam, if your heart be so obdurate,
2751	Vouchsafe me yet your picture for my love,
2752	The picture that is hanging in your chamber;
2753	To that I'll speak, to that I'll sigh and weep:
2754	For since the substance of your perfect self
2755	Is else devoted, I am but a shadow;
2756	And to your shadow will I make true love.
2757	
2758	JULIA	[Aside]  If 'twere a substance, you would, sure,
2759	deceive it,
2760	And make it but a shadow, as I am.
2761	
2762	SILVIA	I am very loath to be your idol, sir;
2763	But since your falsehood shall become you well
2764	To worship shadows and adore false shapes,
2765	Send to me in the morning and I'll send it:
2766	And so, good rest.
2767	
2768	PROTEUS	                  As wretches have o'ernight
2769	That wait for execution in the morn.
2770	
2771	[Exeunt PROTEUS and SILVIA severally]
2772	
2773	JULIA	Host, will you go?
2774	
2775	Host	By my halidom, I was fast asleep.
2776	
2777	JULIA	Pray you, where lies Sir Proteus?
2778	
2779	Host	Marry, at my house. Trust me, I think 'tis almost
2780	day.
2781	
2782	JULIA	Not so; but it hath been the longest night
2783	That e'er I watch'd and the most heaviest.

2799	
2800	[Enter EGLAMOUR]
2801	
2802	EGLAMOUR	This is the hour that Madam Silvia
2803	Entreated me to call and know her mind:
2804	There's some great matter she'ld employ me in.
2805	Madam, madam!
2806	
2807	[Enter SILVIA above]
2808	
2809	SILVIA	                  Who calls?
2810	
2811	EGLAMOUR	Your servant and your friend;
2812	One that attends your ladyship's command.
2813	
2814	SILVIA	Sir Eglamour, a thousand times good morrow.
2815	
2816	EGLAMOUR	As many, worthy lady, to yourself:
2817	According to your ladyship's impose,
2818	I am thus early come to know what service
2819	It is your pleasure to command me in.
2820	
2821	SILVIA	O Eglamour, thou art a gentleman--
2822	Think not I flatter, for I swear I do not--
2823	Valiant, wise, remorseful, well accomplish'd:
2824	Thou art not ignorant what dear good will
2825	I bear unto the banish'd Valentine,
2826	Nor how my father would enforce me marry
2827	Vain Thurio, whom my very soul abhors.
2828	Thyself hast loved; and I have heard thee say
2829	No grief did ever come so near thy heart
2830	As when thy lady and thy true love died,
2831	Upon whose grave thou vow'dst pure chastity.
2832	Sir Eglamour, I would to Valentine,
2833	To Mantua, where I hear he makes abode;
2834	And, for the ways are dangerous to pass,
2835	I do desire thy worthy company,
2836	Upon whose faith and honour I repose.
2837	Urge not my father's anger, Eglamour,
2838	But think upon my grief, a lady's grief,
2839	And on the justice of my flying hence,
2840	To keep me from a most unholy match,
2841	Which heaven and fortune still rewards with plagues.
2842	I do desire thee, even from a heart
2843	As full of sorrows as the sea of sands,
2844	To bear me company and go with me:
2845	If not, to hide what I have said to thee,
2846	That I may venture to depart alone.
2847	
2848	EGLAMOUR	Madam, I pity much your grievances;
2849	Which since I know they virtuously are placed,
2850	I give consent to go along with you,
2851	Recking as little what betideth me
2852	As much I wish all good befortune you.
2853	When will you go?
2854	
2855	SILVIA	                  This evening coming.
2856	
2857	EGLAMOUR	Where shall I meet you?
2858	
2859	SILVIA	At Friar Patrick's cell,
2860	Where I intend holy confession.
2861	
2862	EGLAMOUR	I will not fail your ladyship. Good morrow, gentle lady.
2863	
2864	SILVIA	Good morrow, kind Sir Eglamour.

2872	
2873	
2874	ACT IV
2875	
2876	
2877	
2878	SCENE IV	The same.
2879	
2880	
2881	[Enter LAUNCE, with his his Dog]
2882	
2883	LAUNCE	When a man's servant shall play the cur with him,
2884	look you, it goes hard: one that I brought up of a
2885	puppy; one that I saved from drowning, when three or
2886	four of his blind brothers and sisters went to it.
2887	I have taught him, even as one would say precisely,
2888	'thus I would teach a dog.' I was sent to deliver
2889	him as a present to Mistress Silvia from my master;
2890	and I came no sooner into the dining-chamber but he
2891	steps me to her trencher and steals her capon's leg:
2892	O, 'tis a foul thing when a cur cannot keep himself
2893	in all companies! I would have, as one should say,
2894	one that takes upon him to be a dog indeed, to be,
2895	as it were, a dog at all things. If I had not had
2896	more wit than he, to take a fault upon me that he did,
2897	I think verily he had been hanged for't; sure as I
2898	live, he had suffered for't; you shall judge. He
2899	thrusts me himself into the company of three or four
2900	gentlemanlike dogs under the duke's table: he had
2901	not been there--bless the mark!--a pissing while, but
2902	all the chamber smelt him. 'Out with the dog!' says
2903	one: 'What cur is that?' says another: 'Whip him
2904	out' says the third: 'Hang him up' says the duke.
2905	I, having been acquainted with the smell before,
2906	knew it was Crab, and goes me to the fellow that
2907	whips the dogs: 'Friend,' quoth I, 'you mean to whip
2908	the dog?' 'Ay, marry, do I,' quoth he. 'You do him
2909	the more wrong,' quoth I; ''twas I did the thing you
2910	wot of.' He makes me no more ado, but whips me out
2911	of the chamber. How many masters would do this for
2912	his servant? Nay, I'll be sworn, I have sat in the
2913	stocks for puddings he hath stolen, otherwise he had
2914	been executed; I have stood on the pillory for geese
2915	he hath killed, otherwise he had suffered for't.
2916	Thou thinkest not of this now. Nay, I remember the
2917	trick you served me when I took my leave of Madam
2918	Silvia: did not I bid thee still mark me and do as I
2919	do? when didst thou see me heave up my leg and make
2920	water against a gentlewoman's farthingale? didst
2921	thou ever see me do such a trick?
2922	
2923	[Enter PROTEUS and JULIA]
2924	
2925	PROTEUS	Sebastian is thy name? I like thee well
2926	And will employ thee in some service presently.
2927	
2928	JULIA	In what you please: I'll do what I can.
2929	
2930	PROTEUS	I hope thou wilt.
2931	
2932	[To LAUNCE]
2933	
2934	How now, you whoreson peasant!
2935	Where have you been these two days loitering?
2936	
2937	LAUNCE	Marry, sir, I carried Mistress Silvia the dog you bade me.
2938	
2939	PROTEUS	And what says she to my little jewel?
2940	
2941	LAUNCE	Marry, she says your dog was a cur, and tells you
2942	currish thanks is good enough for such a present.
2943	
2944	PROTEUS	But she received my dog?
2945	
2946	LAUNCE	No, indeed, did she not: here have I brought him
2947	back again.
2948	
2949	PROTEUS	What, didst thou offer her this from me?
2950	
2951	LAUNCE	Ay, sir: the other squirrel was stolen from me by
2952	the hangman boys in the market-place: and then I
2953	offered her mine own, who is a dog as big as ten of
2954	yours, and therefore the gift the greater.
2955	
2956	PROTEUS	Go get thee hence, and find my dog again,
2957	Or ne'er return again into my sight.
2958	Away, I say! stay'st thou to vex me here?
2959	
2960	[Exit LAUNCE]
2961	
2962	A slave, that still an end turns me to shame!
2963	Sebastian, I have entertained thee,
2964	Partly that I have need of such a youth
2965	That can with some discretion do my business,
2966	For 'tis no trusting to yond foolish lout,
2967	But chiefly for thy face and thy behavior,
2968	Which, if my augury deceive me not,
2969	Witness good bringing up, fortune and truth:
2970	Therefore know thou, for this I entertain thee.
2971	Go presently and take this ring with thee,
2972	Deliver it to Madam Silvia:
2973	She loved me well deliver'd it to me.
2974	
2975	JULIA	It seems you loved not her, to leave her token.
2976	She is dead, belike?
2977	
2978	PROTEUS	Not so; I think she lives.
2979	
2980	JULIA	Alas!
2981	
2982	PROTEUS	Why dost thou cry 'alas'?
2983	
2984	JULIA	I cannot choose
2985	But pity her.
2986	
2987	PROTEUS	                  Wherefore shouldst thou pity her?
2988	
2989	JULIA	Because methinks that she loved you as well
2990	As you do love your lady Silvia:
2991	She dreams of him that has forgot her love;
2992	You dote on her that cares not for your love.
2993	'Tis pity love should be so contrary;
2994	And thinking of it makes me cry 'alas!'
2995	
2996	PROTEUS	Well, give her that ring and therewithal
2997	This letter. That's her chamber. Tell my lady
2998	I claim the promise for her heavenly picture.
2999	Your message done, hie home unto my chamber,
3000	Where thou shalt find me, sad and solitary.
3001	
3002	[Exit]
3003	
3004	JULIA	How many women would do such a message?
3005	Alas, poor Proteus! thou hast entertain'd
3006	A fox to be the shepherd of thy lambs.
3007	Alas, poor fool! why do I pity him
3008	That with his very heart despiseth me?
3009	Because he loves her, he despiseth me;
3010	Because I love him I must pity him.
3011	This ring I gave him when he parted from me,
3012	To bind him to remember my good will;
3013	And now am I, unhappy messenger,
3014	To plead for that which I would not obtain,
3015	To carry that which I would have refused,
3016	To praise his faith which I would have dispraised.
3017	I am my master's true-confirmed love;
3018	But cannot be true servant to my master,
3019	Unless I prove false traitor to myself.
3020	Yet will I woo for him, but yet so coldly
3021	As, heaven it knows, I would not have him speed.
3022	
3023	[Enter SILVIA, attended]
3024	
3025	Gentlewoman, good day! I pray you, be my mean
3026	To bring me where to speak with Madam Silvia.
3027	
3028	SILVIA	What would you with her, if that I be she?
3029	
3030	JULIA	If you be she, I do entreat your patience
3031	To hear me speak the message I am sent on.
3032	
3033	SILVIA	From whom?
3034	
3035	JULIA	From my master, Sir Proteus, madam.
3036	
3037	SILVIA	O, he sends you for a picture.
3038	
3039	JULIA	Ay, madam.
3040	
3041	SILVIA	Ursula, bring my picture here.
3042	Go give your master this: tell him from me,
3043	One Julia, that his changing thoughts forget,
3044	Would better fit his chamber than this shadow.
3045	
3046	JULIA	Madam, please you peruse this letter.--
3047	Pardon me, madam; I have unadvised
3048	Deliver'd you a paper that I should not:
3049	This is the letter to your ladyship.
3050	
3051	SILVIA	I pray thee, let me look on that again.
3052	
3053	JULIA	It may not be; good madam, pardon me.
3054	
3055	SILVIA	There, hold!
3056	I will not look upon your master's lines:
3057	I know they are stuff'd with protestations
3058	And full of new-found oaths; which he will break
3059	As easily as I do tear his paper.
3060	
3061	JULIA	Madam, he sends your ladyship this ring.
3062	
3063	SILVIA	The more shame for him that he sends it me;
3064	For I have heard him say a thousand times
3065	His Julia gave it him at his departure.
3066	Though his false finger have profaned the ring,
3067	Mine shall not do his Julia so much wrong.
3068	
3069	JULIA	She thanks you.
3070	
3071	SILVIA	What say'st thou?
3072	
3073	JULIA	I thank you, madam, that you tender her.
3074	Poor gentlewoman! my master wrongs her much.
3075	
3076	SILVIA	Dost thou know her?
3077	
3078	JULIA	Almost as well as I do know myself:
3079	To think upon her woes I do protest
3080	That I have wept a hundred several times.
3081	
3082	SILVIA	Belike she thinks that Proteus hath forsook her.
3083	
3084	JULIA	I think she doth; and that's her cause of sorrow.
3085	
3086	SILVIA	Is she not passing fair?
3087	
3088	JULIA	She hath been fairer, madam, than she is:
3089	When she did think my master loved her well,
3090	She, in my judgment, was as fair as you:
3091	But since she did neglect her looking-glass
3092	And threw her sun-expelling mask away,
3093	The air hath starved the roses in her cheeks
3094	And pinch'd the lily-tincture of her face,
3095	That now she is become as black as I.
3096	
3097	SILVIA	How tall was she?
3098	
3099	JULIA	About my stature; for at Pentecost,
3100	When all our pageants of delight were play'd,
3101	Our youth got me to play the woman's part,
3102	And I was trimm'd in Madam Julia's gown,
3103	Which served me as fit, by all men's judgments,
3104	As if the garment had been made for me:
3105	Therefore I know she is about my height.
3106	And at that time I made her weep agood,
3107	For I did play a lamentable part:
3108	Madam, 'twas Ariadne passioning
3109	For Theseus' perjury and unjust flight;
3110	Which I so lively acted with my tears
3111	That my poor mistress, moved therewithal,
3112	Wept bitterly; and would I might be dead
3113	If I in thought felt not her very sorrow!
3114	
3115	SILVIA	She is beholding to thee, gentle youth.
3116	Alas, poor lady, desolate and left!
3117	I weep myself to think upon thy words.
3118	Here, youth, there is my purse; I give thee this
3119	For thy sweet mistress' sake, because thou lovest her.
3120	Farewell.
3121	
3122	[Exit SILVIA, with attendants]
3123	
3124	JULIA	And she shall thank you for't, if e'er you know her.
3125	A virtuous gentlewoman, mild and beautiful
3126	I hope my master's suit will be but cold,
3127	Since she respects my mistress' love so much.
3128	Alas, how love can trifle with itself!
3129	Here is her picture: let me see; I think,
3130	If I had such a tire, this face of mine
3131	Were full as lovely as is this of hers:
3132	And yet the painter flatter'd her a little,
3133	Unless I flatter with myself too much.
3134	Her hair is auburn, mine is perfect yellow:
3135	If that be all the difference in his love,
3136	I'll get me such a colour'd periwig.
3137	Her eyes are grey as glass, and so are mine:
3138	Ay, but her forehead's low, and mine's as high.
3139	What should it be that he respects in her
3140	But I can make respective in myself,
3141	If this fond Love were not a blinded god?
3142	Come, shadow, come and take this shadow up,
3143	For 'tis thy rival. O thou senseless form,
3144	Thou shalt be worshipp'd, kiss'd, loved and adored!
3145	And, were there sense in his idolatry,
3146	My substance should be statue in thy stead.
3147	I'll use thee kindly for thy mistress' sake,
3148	That used me so; or else, by Jove I vow,
3149	I should have scratch'd out your unseeing eyes
3150	To make my master out of love with thee!

3169	EGLAMOUR	The sun begins to gild the western sky;
3170	And now it is about the very hour
3171	That Silvia, at Friar Patrick's cell, should meet me.
3172	She will not fail, for lovers break not hours,
3173	Unless it be to come before their time;
3174	So much they spur their expedition.
3175	See where she comes.
3176	
3177	[Enter SILVIA]
3178	
3179	Lady, a happy evening!
3180	
3181	SILVIA	Amen, amen! Go on, good Eglamour,
3182	Out at the postern by the abbey-wall:
3183	I fear I am attended by some spies.
3184	
3185	EGLAMOUR	Fear not: the forest is not three leagues off;

3201	
3202	
3203	[Enter THURIO, PROTEUS, and JULIA]
3204	
3205	THURIO	Sir Proteus, what says Silvia to my suit?
3206	
3207	PROTEUS	O, sir, I find her milder than she was;
3208	And yet she takes exceptions at your person.
3209	
3210	THURIO	What, that my leg is too long?
3211	
3212	PROTEUS	No; that it is too little.
3213	
3214	THURIO	I'll wear a boot, to make it somewhat rounder.
3215	
3216	JULIA	[Aside]  But love will not be spurr'd to what
3217	it loathes.
3218	
3219	THURIO	What says she to my face?
3220	
3221	PROTEUS	She says it is a fair one.
3222	
3223	THURIO	Nay then, the wanton lies; my face is black.
3224	
3225	PROTEUS	But pearls are fair; and the old saying is,
3226	Black men are pearls in beauteous ladies' eyes.
3227	
3228	JULIA	[Aside]  'Tis true; such pearls as put out
3229	ladies' eyes;
3230	For I had rather wink than look on them.
3231	
3232	THURIO	How likes she my discourse?
3233	
3234	PROTEUS	Ill, when you talk of war.
3235	
3236	THURIO	But well, when I discourse of love and peace?
3237	
3238	JULIA	[Aside]  But better, indeed, when you hold your peace.
3239	
3240	THURIO	What says she to my valour?
3241	
3242	PROTEUS	O, sir, she makes no doubt of that.
3243	
3244	JULIA	[Aside]  She needs not, when she knows it cowardice.
3245	
3246	THURIO	What says she to my birth?
3247	
3248	PROTEUS	That you are well derived.
3249	
3250	JULIA	[Aside]  True; from a gentleman to a fool.
3251	
3252	THURIO	Considers she my possessions?
3253	
3254	PROTEUS	O, ay; and pities them.
3255	
3256	THURIO	Wherefore?
3257	
3258	JULIA	[Aside]  That such an ass should owe them.
3259	
3260	PROTEUS	That they are out by lease.
3261

3271	PROTEUS	     Nor I.
3272	
3273	DUKE	          Saw you my daughter?
3274	
3275	PROTEUS	Neither.
3276	
3277	DUKE	Why then,
3278	She's fled unto that peasant Valentine;
3279	And Eglamour is in her company.
3280	'Tis true; for Friar Laurence met them both,
3281	As he in penance wander'd through the forest;
3282	Him he knew well, and guess'd that it was she,
3283	But, being mask'd, he was not sure of it;
3284	Besides, she did intend confession
3285	At Patrick's cell this even; and there she was not;
3286	These likelihoods confirm her flight from hence.
3287	Therefore, I pray you, stand not to discourse,
3288	But mount you presently and meet with me
3289	Upon the rising of the mountain-foot
3290	That leads towards Mantua, whither they are fled:
3291	Dispatch, sweet gentlemen, and follow me.
3292	
3293	[Exit]
3294	
3295	THURIO	Why, this it is to be a peevish girl,
3296	That flies her fortune when it follows her.
3297	I'll after, more to be revenged on Eglamour
3298	Than for the love of reckless Silvia.
3299	
3300	[Exit]
3301	
3302	PROTEUS	And I will follow, more for Silvia's love
3303	Than hate of Eglamour that goes with her.
3304	
3305	[Exit]
3306	
3307	JULIA	And I will follow, more to cross that love
3308	Than hate for Silvia that is gone for love.
3309	
3310	[Exit]
3311	
3312	
3313	
3314	
3315	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
3316	
3317	
3318	ACT V
3319	
3320	
3321	
3322	SCENE III	The frontiers of Mantua. The forest.
3323	
3324	
3325	[Enter Outlaws with SILVIA]
3326	
3327	First Outlaw	Come, come,
3328	Be patient; we must bring you to our captain.
3329	
3330	SILVIA	A thousand more mischances than this one
3331	Have learn'd me how to brook this patiently.
3332	
3333	Second Outlaw	Come, bring her away.
3334	
3335	First Outlaw	Where is the gentleman that was with her?
3336	
3337	Third Outlaw	Being nimble-footed, he hath outrun us,
3338	But Moyses and Valerius follow him.
3339	Go thou with her to the west end of the wood;
3340	There is our captain: we'll follow him that's fled;
3341	The thicket is beset; he cannot 'scape.
3342	
3343	First Outlaw	Come, I must bring you to our captain's cave:
3344	Fear not; he bears an honourable mind,
3345	And will not use a woman lawlessly.
3346	
3347	SILVIA	O Valentine, this I endure for thee!
3348	
3349	[Exeunt]
3350	
3351	
3352	
3353	
3354	THE TWO GENTLEMEN OF VERONA
3355	
3356	
3357	ACT V
3358	
3359	
3360	
3361	SCENE IV	Another part of the forest.
3362	
3363	
3364	[Enter VALENTINE]
3365	
3366	VALENTINE	How use doth breed a habit in a man!
3367	This shadowy desert, unfrequented woods,
3368	I better brook than flourishing peopled towns:
3369	Here can I sit alone, unseen of any,
3370	And to the nightingale's complaining notes
3371	Tune my distresses and record my woes.
3372	O thou that dost inhabit in my breast,
3373	Leave not the mansion so long tenantless,
3374	Lest, growing ruinous, the building fall
3375	And leave no memory of what it was!
3376	Repair me with thy presence, Silvia;
3377	Thou gentle nymph, cherish thy forlorn swain!
3378	What halloing and what stir is this to-day?
3379	These are my mates, that make their wills their law,
3380	Have some unhappy passenger in chase.
3381	They love me well; yet I have much to do
3382	To keep them from uncivil outrages.
3383	Withdraw thee, Valentine: who's this comes here?
3384	
3385	[Enter PROTEUS, SILVIA, and JULIA]
3386	
3387	PROTEUS	Madam, this service I have done for you,
3388	Though you respect not aught your servant doth,
3389	To hazard life and rescue you from him
3390	That would have forced your honour and your love;
3391	Vouchsafe me, for my meed, but one fair look;
3392	A smaller boon than this I cannot beg
3393	And less than this, I am sure, you cannot give.
3394	
3395	VALENTINE	[Aside]  How like a dream is this I see and hear!
3396	Love, lend me patience to forbear awhile.
3397	
3398	SILVIA	O miserable, unhappy that I am!
3399	
3400	PROTEUS	Unhappy were you, madam, ere I came;
3401	But by my coming I have made you happy.
3402	
3403	SILVIA	By thy approach thou makest me most unhappy.
3404	
3405	JULIA	[Aside]  And me, when he approacheth to your presence.
3406	
3407	SILVIA	Had I been seized by a hungry lion,
3408	I would have been a breakfast to the beast,
3409	Rather than have false Proteus rescue me.
3410	O, Heaven be judge how I love Valentine,
3411	Whose life's as tender to me as my soul!
3412	And full as much, for more there cannot be,
3413	I do detest false perjured Proteus.
3414	Therefore be gone; solicit me no more.
3415	
3416	PROTEUS	What dangerous action, stood it next to death,
3417	Would I not undergo for one calm look!
3418	O, 'tis the curse in love, and still approved,
3419	When women cannot love where they're beloved!
3420	
3421	SILVIA	When Proteus cannot love where he's beloved.
3422	Read over Julia's heart, thy first best love,
3423	For whose dear sake thou didst then rend thy faith
3424	Into a thousand oaths; and all those oaths
3425	Descended into perjury, to love me.
3426	Thou hast no faith left now, unless thou'dst two;
3427	And that's far worse than none; better have none
3428	Than plural faith which is too much by one:
3429	Thou counterfeit to thy true friend!
3430	
3431	PROTEUS	In love
3432	Who respects friend?
3433	
3434	SILVIA	All men but Proteus.
3435	
3436	PROTEUS	Nay, if the gentle spirit of moving words
3437	Can no way change you to a milder form,
3438	I'll woo you like a soldier, at arms' end,
3439	And love you 'gainst the nature of love,--force ye.
3440	
3441	SILVIA	O heaven!
3442	
3443	PROTEUS	        I'll force thee yield to my desire.
3444	
3445	VALENTINE	Ruffian, let go that rude uncivil touch,
3446	Thou friend of an ill fashion!
3447	
3448	PROTEUS	Valentine!
3449	
3450	VALENTINE	Thou common friend, that's without faith or love,
3451	For such is a friend now; treacherous man!
3452	Thou hast beguiled my hopes; nought but mine eye
3453	Could have persuaded me: now I dare not say
3454	I have one friend alive; thou wouldst disprove me.
3455	Who should be trusted, when one's own right hand
3456	Is perjured to the bosom? Proteus,
3457	I am sorry I must never trust thee more,
3458	But count the world a stranger for thy sake.
3459	The private wound is deepest: O time most accurst,
3460	'Mongst all foes that a friend should be the worst!
3461	
3462	PROTEUS	My shame and guilt confounds me.
3463	Forgive me, Valentine: if hearty sorrow
3464	Be a sufficient ransom for offence,
3465	I tender 't here; I do as truly suffer
3466	As e'er I did commit.
3467	
3468	VALENTINE	Then I am paid;
3469	And once again I do receive thee honest.
3470	Who by repentance is not satisfied
3471	Is nor of heaven nor earth, for these are pleased.
3472	By penitence the Eternal's wrath's appeased:
3473	And, that my love may appear plain and free,
3474	All that was mine in Silvia I give thee.
3475	
3476	JULIA	O me unhappy!
3477	
3478	[Swoons]
3479	
3480	PROTEUS	Look to the boy.
3481	
3482	VALENTINE	Why, boy! why, wag! how now! what's the matter?
3483	Look up; speak.
3484	
3485	JULIA	O good sir, my master charged me to deliver a ring
3486	to Madam Silvia, which, out of my neglect, was never done.
3487	
3488	PROTEUS	Where is that ring, boy?
3489	
3490	JULIA	Here 'tis; this is it.
3491	
3492	PROTEUS	How! let me see:
3493	Why, this is the ring I gave to Julia.
3494	
3495	JULIA	O, cry you mercy, sir, I have mistook:
3496	This is the ring you sent to Silvia.
3497	
3498	PROTEUS	But how camest thou by this ring? At my depart
3499	I gave this unto Julia.
3500	
3501	JULIA	And Julia herself did give it me;
3502	And Julia herself hath brought it hither.
3503	
3504	PROTEUS	How! Julia!
3505	
3506	JULIA	Behold her that gave aim to all thy oaths,
3507	And entertain'd 'em deeply in her heart.
3508	How oft hast thou with perjury cleft the root!
3509	O Proteus, let this habit make thee blush!
3510	Be thou ashamed that I have took upon me
3511	Such an immodest raiment, if shame live
3512	In a disguise of love:
3513	It is the lesser blot, modesty finds,
3514	Women to change their shapes than men their minds.
3515	
3516	PROTEUS	Than men their minds! 'tis true.
3517	O heaven! were man
3518	But constant, he were perfect. That one error
3519	Fills him with faults; makes him run through all the sins:
3520	Inconstancy falls off ere it begins.
3521	What is in Silvia's face, but I may spy
3522	More fresh in Julia's with a constant eye?
3523	
3524	VALENTINE	Come, come, a hand from either:
3525	Let me be blest to make this happy close;
3526	'Twere pity two such friends should be long foes.
3527	
3528	PROTEUS	Bear witness, Heaven, I have my wish for ever.
3529	
3530	JULIA	And I mine.
3531	
3532	[Enter Outlaws, with DUKE and THURIO]
3533	
3534	Outlaws	A prize, a prize, a prize!
3535	
3536	VALENTINE	Forbear, forbear, I say! it is my lord the duke.
3537	Your grace is welcome to a man disgraced,
3538	Banished Valentine.
3539	
3540	DUKE	Sir Valentine!
3541	
3542	THURIO	Yonder is Silvia; and Silvia's mine.
3543	
3544	VALENTINE	Thurio, give back, or else embrace thy death;
3545	Come not within the measure of my wrath;
3546	Do not name Silvia thine; if once again,
3547	Verona shall not hold thee. Here she stands;
3548	Take but possession of her with a touch:
3549	I dare thee but to breathe upon my love.
3550	
3551	THURIO	Sir Valentine, I care not for her, I;
3552	I hold him but a fool that will endanger
3553	His body for a girl that loves him not:
3554	I claim her not, and therefore she is thine.
3555	
3556	DUKE	The more degenerate and base art thou,
3557	To make such means for her as thou hast done
3558	And leave her on such slight conditions.
3559	Now, by the honour of my ancestry,
3560	I do applaud thy spirit, Valentine,
3561	And think thee worthy of an empress' love:
3562	Know then, I here forget all former griefs,
3563	Cancel all grudge, repeal thee home again,
3564	Plead a new state in thy unrivall'd merit,
3565	To which I thus subscribe: Sir Valentine,
3566	Thou art a gentleman and well derived;
3567	Take thou thy Silvia, for thou hast deserved her.
3568	
3569	VALENTINE	I thank your grace; the gift hath made me happy.
3570	I now beseech you, for your daughter's sake,
3571	To grant one boom that I shall ask of you.
3572	
3573	DUKE	I grant it, for thine own, whate'er it be.
3574	
3575	VALENTINE	These banish'd men that I have kept withal
3576	Are men endued with worthy qualities:
3577	Forgive them what they have committed here
3578	And let them be recall'd from their exile:
3579	They are reformed, civil, full of good
3580	And fit for great employment, worthy lord.
3581	
3582	DUKE	Thou hast prevail'd; I pardon them and thee:
3583	Dispose of them as thou know'st their deserts.
3584	Come, let us go: we will include all jars
3585	With triumphs, mirth and rare solemnity.
3586	
3587	VALENTINE	And, as we walk along, I dare be bold
3588	With our discourse to make your grace to smile.
3589	What think you of this page, my lord?
3590	
3591	DUKE	I think the boy hath grace in him; he blushes.
3592	
3593	VALENTINE	I warrant you, my lord, more grace than boy.
3594	
3595	DUKE	What mean you by that saying?
3596	
3597	VALENTINE	Please you, I'll tell you as we pass along,
3598	That you will wonder what hath fortuned.
3599	Come, Proteus; 'tis your penance but to hear
3600	The story of your loves discovered:
3601	That done, our day of marriage shall be yours;
3602	One feast, one house, one mutual happiness.
3603	
3604	[Exeunt]

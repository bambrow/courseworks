126	INDUCTION
127	
128	
129	[Warkworth. Before the castle]
130	
131	[Enter RUMOUR, painted full of tongues]
132	
133	RUMOUR	Open your ears; for which of you will stop
134	The vent of hearing when loud Rumour speaks?
135	I, from the orient to the drooping west,
136	Making the wind my post-horse, still unfold
137	The acts commenced on this ball of earth:
138	Upon my tongues continual slanders ride,
139	The which in every language I pronounce,
140	Stuffing the ears of men with false reports.
141	I speak of peace, while covert enmity
142	Under the smile of safety wounds the world:
143	And who but Rumour, who but only I,
144	Make fearful musters and prepared defence,
145	Whiles the big year, swoln with some other grief,
146	Is thought with child by the stern tyrant war,
147	And no such matter? Rumour is a pipe
148	Blown by surmises, jealousies, conjectures
149	And of so easy and so plain a stop
150	That the blunt monster with uncounted heads,
151	The still-discordant wavering multitude,
152	Can play upon it. But what need I thus
153	My well-known body to anatomize
154	Among my household? Why is Rumour here?
155	I run before King Harry's victory;
156	Who in a bloody field by Shrewsbury
157	Hath beaten down young Hotspur and his troops,
158	Quenching the flame of bold rebellion
159	Even with the rebel's blood. But what mean I
160	To speak so true at first? my office is
161	To noise abroad that Harry Monmouth fell
162	Under the wrath of noble Hotspur's sword,
163	And that the king before the Douglas' rage
164	Stoop'd his anointed head as low as death.
165	This have I rumour'd through the peasant towns
166	Between that royal field of Shrewsbury
167	And this worm-eaten hold of ragged stone,
168	Where Hotspur's father, old Northumberland,
169	Lies crafty-sick: the posts come tiring on,
170	And not a man of them brings other news
171	Than they have learn'd of me: from Rumour's tongues
172	They bring smooth comforts false, worse than
173	true wrongs.

183	ACT I
184	
185	
186	
187	SCENE I	The same.
188	
189	
190	[Enter LORD BARDOLPH]
191	
192	LORD BARDOLPH	Who keeps the gate here, ho?
193	
194	[The Porter opens the gate]
195	
196	Where is the earl?
197	
198	Porter	What shall I say you are?
199	
200	LORD BARDOLPH	Tell thou the earl
201	That the Lord Bardolph doth attend him here.
202	
203	Porter	His lordship is walk'd forth into the orchard;
204	Please it your honour, knock but at the gate,
205	And he himself wilt answer.
206	
207	[Enter NORTHUMBERLAND]
208	
209	LORD BARDOLPH	Here comes the earl.
210	
211	[Exit Porter]
212	
213	NORTHUMBERLAND	What news, Lord Bardolph? every minute now
214	Should be the father of some stratagem:
215	The times are wild: contention, like a horse
216	Full of high feeding, madly hath broke loose
217	And bears down all before him.
218	
219	LORD BARDOLPH	Noble earl,
220	I bring you certain news from Shrewsbury.
221	
222	NORTHUMBERLAND	Good, an God will!
223	
224	LORD BARDOLPH	                  As good as heart can wish:
225	The king is almost wounded to the death;
226	And, in the fortune of my lord your son,
227	Prince Harry slain outright; and both the Blunts
228	Kill'd by the hand of Douglas; young Prince John
229	And Westmoreland and Stafford fled the field;
230	And Harry Monmouth's brawn, the hulk Sir John,
231	Is prisoner to your son: O, such a day,
232	So fought, so follow'd and so fairly won,
233	Came not till now to dignify the times,
234	Since Caesar's fortunes!
235	
236	NORTHUMBERLAND	How is this derived?
237	Saw you the field? came you from Shrewsbury?
238	
239	LORD BARDOLPH	I spake with one, my lord, that came from thence,
240	A gentleman well bred and of good name,
241	That freely render'd me these news for true.
242	
243	NORTHUMBERLAND	Here comes my servant Travers, whom I sent
244	On Tuesday last to listen after news.
245	
246	[Enter TRAVERS]
247	
248	LORD BARDOLPH	My lord, I over-rode him on the way;
249	And he is furnish'd with no certainties
250	More than he haply may retail from me.
251	
252	NORTHUMBERLAND	Now, Travers, what good tidings comes with you?
253	
254	TRAVERS	My lord, Sir John Umfrevile turn'd me back
255	With joyful tidings; and, being better horsed,
256	Out-rode me. After him came spurring hard
257	A gentleman, almost forspent with speed,
258	That stopp'd by me to breathe his bloodied horse.
259	He ask'd the way to Chester; and of him
260	I did demand what news from Shrewsbury:
261	He told me that rebellion had bad luck
262	And that young Harry Percy's spur was cold.
263	With that, he gave his able horse the head,
264	And bending forward struck his armed heels
265	Against the panting sides of his poor jade
266	Up to the rowel-head, and starting so
267	He seem'd in running to devour the way,
268	Staying no longer question.
269	
270	NORTHUMBERLAND	Ha! Again:
271	Said he young Harry Percy's spur was cold?
272	Of Hotspur Coldspur? that rebellion
273	Had met ill luck?
274	
275	LORD BARDOLPH	                  My lord, I'll tell you what;
276	If my young lord your son have not the day,
277	Upon mine honour, for a silken point
278	I'll give my barony: never talk of it.
279	
280	NORTHUMBERLAND	Why should that gentleman that rode by Travers
281	Give then such instances of loss?
282	
283	LORD BARDOLPH	Who, he?
284	He was some hilding fellow that had stolen
285	The horse he rode on, and, upon my life,
286	Spoke at a venture. Look, here comes more news.
287	
288	[Enter MORTON]
289	
290	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yea, this man's brow, like to a title-leaf,
291	Foretells the nature of a tragic volume:
292	So looks the strand whereon the imperious flood
293	Hath left a witness'd usurpation.
294	Say, Morton, didst thou come from Shrewsbury?
295	
296	MORTON	I ran from Shrewsbury, my noble lord;
297	Where hateful death put on his ugliest mask
298	To fright our party.
299	
300	NORTHUMBERLAND	How doth my son and brother?
301	Thou tremblest; and the whiteness in thy cheek
302	Is apter than thy tongue to tell thy errand.
303	Even such a man, so faint, so spiritless,
304	So dull, so dead in look, so woe-begone,
305	Drew Priam's curtain in the dead of night,
306	And would have told him half his Troy was burnt;
307	But Priam found the fire ere he his tongue,
308	And I my Percy's death ere thou report'st it.
309	This thou wouldst say, 'Your son did thus and thus;
310	Your brother thus: so fought the noble Douglas:'
311	Stopping my greedy ear with their bold deeds:
312	But in the end, to stop my ear indeed,
313	Thou hast a sigh to blow away this praise,
314	Ending with 'Brother, son, and all are dead.'
315	
316	MORTON	Douglas is living, and your brother, yet;
317	But, for my lord your son--
318	
319	NORTHUMBERLAND	Why, he is dead.
320	See what a ready tongue suspicion hath!
321	He that but fears the thing he would not know
322	Hath by instinct knowledge from others' eyes
323	That what he fear'd is chanced. Yet speak, Morton;
324	Tell thou an earl his divination lies,
325	And I will take it as a sweet disgrace
326	And make thee rich for doing me such wrong.
327	
328	MORTON	You are too great to be by me gainsaid:
329	Your spirit is too true, your fears too certain.
330	
331	NORTHUMBERLAND	Yet, for all this, say not that Percy's dead.
332	I see a strange confession in thine eye:
333	Thou shakest thy head and hold'st it fear or sin
334	To speak a truth. If he be slain, say so;
335	The tongue offends not that reports his death:
336	And he doth sin that doth belie the dead,
337	Not he which says the dead is not alive.
338	Yet the first bringer of unwelcome news
339	Hath but a losing office, and his tongue
340	Sounds ever after as a sullen bell,
341	Remember'd tolling a departing friend.
342	
343	LORD BARDOLPH	I cannot think, my lord, your son is dead.
344	
345	MORTON	I am sorry I should force you to believe
346	That which I would to God I had not seen;
347	But these mine eyes saw him in bloody state,
348	Rendering faint quittance, wearied and out-breathed,
349	To Harry Monmouth; whose swift wrath beat down
350	The never-daunted Percy to the earth,
351	From whence with life he never more sprung up.
352	In few, his death, whose spirit lent a fire
353	Even to the dullest peasant in his camp,
354	Being bruited once, took fire and heat away
355	From the best temper'd courage in his troops;
356	For from his metal was his party steel'd;
357	Which once in him abated, all the rest
358	Turn'd on themselves, like dull and heavy lead:
359	And as the thing that's heavy in itself,
360	Upon enforcement flies with greatest speed,
361	So did our men, heavy in Hotspur's loss,
362	Lend to this weight such lightness with their fear
363	That arrows fled not swifter toward their aim
364	Than did our soldiers, aiming at their safety,
365	Fly from the field. Then was the noble Worcester
366	Too soon ta'en prisoner; and that furious Scot,
367	The bloody Douglas, whose well-labouring sword
368	Had three times slain the appearance of the king,
369	'Gan vail his stomach and did grace the shame
370	Of those that turn'd their backs, and in his flight,
371	Stumbling in fear, was took. The sum of all
372	Is that the king hath won, and hath sent out
373	A speedy power to encounter you, my lord,
374	Under the conduct of young Lancaster
375	And Westmoreland. This is the news at full.
376	
377	NORTHUMBERLAND	For this I shall have time enough to mourn.
378	In poison there is physic; and these news,
379	Having been well, that would have made me sick,
380	Being sick, have in some measure made me well:
381	And as the wretch, whose fever-weaken'd joints,
382	Like strengthless hinges, buckle under life,
383	Impatient of his fit, breaks like a fire
384	Out of his keeper's arms, even so my limbs,
385	Weaken'd with grief, being now enraged with grief,
386	Are thrice themselves. Hence, therefore, thou nice crutch!
387	A scaly gauntlet now with joints of steel
388	Must glove this hand: and hence, thou sickly quoif!
389	Thou art a guard too wanton for the head
390	Which princes, flesh'd with conquest, aim to hit.
391	Now bind my brows with iron; and approach
392	The ragged'st hour that time and spite dare bring
393	To frown upon the enraged Northumberland!
394	Let heaven kiss earth! now let not Nature's hand
395	Keep the wild flood confined! let order die!
396	And let this world no longer be a stage
397	To feed contention in a lingering act;
398	But let one spirit of the first-born Cain
399	Reign in all bosoms, that, each heart being set
400	On bloody courses, the rude scene may end,
401	And darkness be the burier of the dead!
402	
403	TRAVERS	This strained passion doth you wrong, my lord.
404	
405	LORD BARDOLPH	Sweet earl, divorce not wisdom from your honour.
406	
407	MORTON	The lives of all your loving complices
408	Lean on your health; the which, if you give o'er
409	To stormy passion, must perforce decay.
410	You cast the event of war, my noble lord,
411	And summ'd the account of chance, before you said
412	'Let us make head.' It was your presurmise,
413	That, in the dole of blows, your son might drop:
414	You knew he walk'd o'er perils, on an edge,
415	More likely to fall in than to get o'er;
416	You were advised his flesh was capable
417	Of wounds and scars and that his forward spirit
418	Would lift him where most trade of danger ranged:
419	Yet did you say 'Go forth;' and none of this,
420	Though strongly apprehended, could restrain
421	The stiff-borne action: what hath then befallen,
422	Or what hath this bold enterprise brought forth,
423	More than that being which was like to be?
424	
425	LORD BARDOLPH	We all that are engaged to this loss
426	Knew that we ventured on such dangerous seas
427	That if we wrought our life 'twas ten to one;
428	And yet we ventured, for the gain proposed
429	Choked the respect of likely peril fear'd;
430	And since we are o'erset, venture again.
431	Come, we will all put forth, body and goods.
432	
433	MORTON	'Tis more than time: and, my most noble lord,
434	I hear for certain, and do speak the truth,
435	The gentle Archbishop of York is up
436	With well-appointed powers: he is a man
437	Who with a double surety binds his followers.
438	My lord your son had only but the corpse,
439	But shadows and the shows of men, to fight;
440	For that same word, rebellion, did divide
441	The action of their bodies from their souls;
442	And they did fight with queasiness, constrain'd,
443	As men drink potions, that their weapons only
444	Seem'd on our side; but, for their spirits and souls,
445	This word, rebellion, it had froze them up,
446	As fish are in a pond. But now the bishop
447	Turns insurrection to religion:
448	Supposed sincere and holy in his thoughts,
449	He's followed both with body and with mind;
450	And doth enlarge his rising with the blood
451	Of fair King Richard, scraped from Pomfret stones;
452	Derives from heaven his quarrel and his cause;
453	Tells them he doth bestride a bleeding land,
454	Gasping for life under great Bolingbroke;
455	And more and less do flock to follow him.
456	
457	NORTHUMBERLAND	I knew of this before; but, to speak truth,
458	This present grief had wiped it from my mind.
459	Go in with me; and counsel every man
460	The aptest way for safety and revenge:
461	Get posts and letters, and make friends with speed:
462	Never so few, and never yet more need.
463	
464	[Exeunt]

470	
471	
472	ACT I
473	
474	
475	
476	SCENE II	London. A street.
477	
478	
479	[Enter FALSTAFF, with his Page bearing his sword
480	and buckler]
481	
482	FALSTAFF	Sirrah, you giant, what says the doctor to my water?
483	
484	Page	He said, sir, the water itself was a good healthy
485	water; but, for the party that owed it, he might
486	have more diseases than he knew for.
487	
488	FALSTAFF	Men of all sorts take a pride to gird at me: the
489	brain of this foolish-compounded clay, man, is not
490	able to invent anything that tends to laughter, more
491	than I invent or is invented on me: I am not only
492	witty in myself, but the cause that wit is in other
493	men. I do here walk before thee like a sow that
494	hath overwhelmed all her litter but one. If the
495	prince put thee into my service for any other reason
496	than to set me off, why then I have no judgment.
497	Thou whoreson mandrake, thou art fitter to be worn
498	in my cap than to wait at my heels. I was never
499	manned with an agate till now: but I will inset you
500	neither in gold nor silver, but in vile apparel, and
501	send you back again to your master, for a jewel,--
502	the juvenal, the prince your master, whose chin is
503	not yet fledged. I will sooner have a beard grow in
504	the palm of my hand than he shall get one on his
505	cheek; and yet he will not stick to say his face is
506	a face-royal: God may finish it when he will, 'tis
507	not a hair amiss yet: he may keep it still at a
508	face-royal, for a barber shall never earn sixpence
509	out of it; and yet he'll be crowing as if he had
510	writ man ever since his father was a bachelor. He
511	may keep his own grace, but he's almost out of mine,
512	I can assure him. What said Master Dombledon about
513	the satin for my short cloak and my slops?
514	
515	Page	He said, sir, you should procure him better
516	assurance than Bardolph: he would not take his
517	band and yours; he liked not the security.
518	
519	FALSTAFF	Let him be damned, like the glutton! pray God his
520	tongue be hotter! A whoreson Achitophel! a rascally
521	yea-forsooth knave! to bear a gentleman in hand,
522	and then stand upon security! The whoreson
523	smooth-pates do now wear nothing but high shoes, and
524	bunches of keys at their girdles; and if a man is
525	through with them in honest taking up, then they
526	must stand upon security. I had as lief they would
527	put ratsbane in my mouth as offer to stop it with
528	security. I looked a' should have sent me two and
529	twenty yards of satin, as I am a true knight, and he
530	sends me security. Well, he may sleep in security;
531	for he hath the horn of abundance, and the lightness
532	of his wife shines through it: and yet cannot he
533	see, though he have his own lanthorn to light him.
534	Where's Bardolph?
535	
536	Page	He's gone into Smithfield to buy your worship a horse.
537	
538	FALSTAFF	I bought him in Paul's, and he'll buy me a horse in
539	Smithfield: an I could get me but a wife in the
540	stews, I were manned, horsed, and wived.
541	
542	[Enter the Lord Chief-Justice and Servant]
543	
544	Page	Sir, here comes the nobleman that committed the
545	Prince for striking him about Bardolph.
546	
547	FALSTAFF	Wait, close; I will not see him.
548	
549	Lord Chief-Justice	What's he that goes there?
550	
551	Servant	Falstaff, an't please your lordship.
552	
553	Lord Chief-Justice	He that was in question for the robbery?
554	
555	Servant	He, my lord: but he hath since done good service at
556	Shrewsbury; and, as I hear, is now going with some
557	charge to the Lord John of Lancaster.
558	
559	Lord Chief-Justice	What, to York? Call him back again.
560	
561	Servant	Sir John Falstaff!
562	
563	FALSTAFF	Boy, tell him I am deaf.
564	
565	Page	You must speak louder; my master is deaf.
566	
567	Lord Chief-Justice	I am sure he is, to the hearing of any thing good.
568	Go, pluck him by the elbow; I must speak with him.
569	
570	Servant	Sir John!
571	
572	FALSTAFF	What! a young knave, and begging! Is there not
573	wars? is there not employment? doth not the king
574	lack subjects? do not the rebels need soldiers?
575	Though it be a shame to be on any side but one, it
576	is worse shame to beg than to be on the worst side,
577	were it worse than the name of rebellion can tell
578	how to make it.
579	
580	Servant	You mistake me, sir.
581	
582	FALSTAFF	Why, sir, did I say you were an honest man? setting
583	my knighthood and my soldiership aside, I had lied
584	in my throat, if I had said so.
585	
586	Servant	I pray you, sir, then set your knighthood and our
587	soldiership aside; and give me leave to tell you,
588	you lie in your throat, if you say I am any other
589	than an honest man.
590	
591	FALSTAFF	I give thee leave to tell me so! I lay aside that
592	which grows to me! if thou gettest any leave of me,
593	hang me; if thou takest leave, thou wert better be
594	hanged. You hunt counter: hence! avaunt!
595	
596	Servant	Sir, my lord would speak with you.
597	
598	Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John Falstaff, a word with you.
599	
600	FALSTAFF	My good lord! God give your lordship good time of
601	day. I am glad to see your lordship abroad: I heard
602	say your lordship was sick: I hope your lordship
603	goes abroad by advice. Your lordship, though not
604	clean past your youth, hath yet some smack of age in
605	you, some relish of the saltness of time; and I must
606	humbly beseech your lordship to have a reverent care
607	of your health.
608	
609	Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, I sent for you before your expedition to
610	Shrewsbury.
611	
612	FALSTAFF	An't please your lordship, I hear his majesty is
613	returned with some discomfort from Wales.
614	
615	Lord Chief-Justice	I talk not of his majesty: you would not come when
616	I sent for you.
617	
618	FALSTAFF	And I hear, moreover, his highness is fallen into
619	this same whoreson apoplexy.
620	
621	Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God mend him! I pray you, let me speak with
622	you.
623	
624	FALSTAFF	This apoplexy is, as I take it, a kind of lethargy,
625	an't please your lordship; a kind of sleeping in the
626	blood, a whoreson tingling.
627	
628	Lord Chief-Justice	What tell you me of it? be it as it is.
629	
630	FALSTAFF	It hath its original from much grief, from study and
631	perturbation of the brain: I have read the cause of
632	his effects in Galen: it is a kind of deafness.
633	
634	Lord Chief-Justice	I think you are fallen into the disease; for you
635	hear not what I say to you.
636	
637	FALSTAFF	Very well, my lord, very well: rather, an't please
638	you, it is the disease of not listening, the malady
639	of not marking, that I am troubled withal.
640	
641	Lord Chief-Justice	To punish you by the heels would amend the
642	attention of your ears; and I care not if I do
643	become your physician.
644	
645	FALSTAFF	I am as poor as Job, my lord, but not so patient:
646	your lordship may minister the potion of
647	imprisonment to me in respect of poverty; but how
648	should I be your patient to follow your
649	prescriptions, the wise may make some dram of a
650	scruple, or indeed a scruple itself.
651	
652	Lord Chief-Justice	I sent for you, when there were matters against you
653	for your life, to come speak with me.
654	
655	FALSTAFF	As I was then advised by my learned counsel in the
656	laws of this land-service, I did not come.
657	
658	Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the truth is, Sir John, you live in great infamy.
659	
660	FALSTAFF	He that buckles him in my belt cannot live in less.
661	
662	Lord Chief-Justice	Your means are very slender, and your waste is great.
663	
664	FALSTAFF	I would it were otherwise; I would my means were
665	greater, and my waist slenderer.
666	
667	Lord Chief-Justice	You have misled the youthful prince.
668	
669	FALSTAFF	The young prince hath misled me: I am the fellow
670	with the great belly, and he my dog.
671	
672	Lord Chief-Justice	Well, I am loath to gall a new-healed wound: your
673	day's service at Shrewsbury hath a little gilded
674	over your night's exploit on Gad's-hill: you may
675	thank the unquiet time for your quiet o'er-posting
676	that action.
677	
678	FALSTAFF	My lord?
679	
680	Lord Chief-Justice	But since all is well, keep it so: wake not a
681	sleeping wolf.
682	
683	FALSTAFF	To wake a wolf is as bad as to smell a fox.
684	
685	Lord Chief-Justice	What! you are as a candle, the better part burnt
686	out.
687	
688	FALSTAFF	A wassail candle, my lord, all tallow: if I did say
689	of wax, my growth would approve the truth.
690	
691	Lord Chief-Justice	There is not a white hair on your face but should
692	have his effect of gravity.
693	
694	FALSTAFF	His effect of gravy, gravy, gravy.
695	
696	Lord Chief-Justice	You follow the young prince up and down, like his
697	ill angel.
698	
699	FALSTAFF	Not so, my lord; your ill angel is light; but I hope
700	he that looks upon me will take me without weighing:
701	and yet, in some respects, I grant, I cannot go: I
702	cannot tell. Virtue is of so little regard in these
703	costermonger times that true valour is turned
704	bear-herd: pregnancy is made a tapster, and hath
705	his quick wit wasted in giving reckonings: all the
706	other gifts appertinent to man, as the malice of
707	this age shapes them, are not worth a gooseberry.
708	You that are old consider not the capacities of us
709	that are young; you do measure the heat of our
710	livers with the bitterness of your galls: and we
711	that are in the vaward of our youth, I must confess,
712	are wags too.
713	
714	Lord Chief-Justice	Do you set down your name in the scroll of youth,
715	that are written down old with all the characters of
716	age? Have you not a moist eye? a dry hand? a
717	yellow cheek? a white beard? a decreasing leg? an
718	increasing belly? is not your voice broken? your
719	wind short? your chin double? your wit single? and
720	every part about you blasted with antiquity? and
721	will you yet call yourself young? Fie, fie, fie, Sir John!
722	
723	FALSTAFF	My lord, I was born about three of the clock in the
724	afternoon, with a white head and something a round
725	belly. For my voice, I have lost it with halloing
726	and singing of anthems. To approve my youth
727	further, I will not: the truth is, I am only old in
728	judgment and understanding; and he that will caper
729	with me for a thousand marks, let him lend me the
730	money, and have at him! For the box of the ear that
731	the prince gave you, he gave it like a rude prince,
732	and you took it like a sensible lord. I have
733	chequed him for it, and the young lion repents;
734	marry, not in ashes and sackcloth, but in new silk
735	and old sack.
736	
737	Lord Chief-Justice	Well, God send the prince a better companion!
738	
739	FALSTAFF	God send the companion a better prince! I cannot
740	rid my hands of him.
741	
742	Lord Chief-Justice	Well, the king hath severed you and Prince Harry: I
743	hear you are going with Lord John of Lancaster
744	against the Archbishop and the Earl of
745	Northumberland.
746	
747	FALSTAFF	Yea; I thank your pretty sweet wit for it. But look
748	you pray, all you that kiss my lady Peace at home,
749	that our armies join not in a hot day; for, by the
750	Lord, I take but two shirts out with me, and I mean
751	not to sweat extraordinarily: if it be a hot day,
752	and I brandish any thing but a bottle, I would I
753	might never spit white again. There is not a
754	dangerous action can peep out his head but I am
755	thrust upon it: well, I cannot last ever: but it
756	was alway yet the trick of our English nation, if
757	they have a good thing, to make it too common. If
758	ye will needs say I am an old man, you should give
759	me rest. I would to God my name were not so
760	terrible to the enemy as it is: I were better to be
761	eaten to death with a rust than to be scoured to
762	nothing with perpetual motion.
763	
764	Lord Chief-Justice	Well, be honest, be honest; and God bless your
765	expedition!
766	
767	FALSTAFF	Will your lordship lend me a thousand pound to
768	furnish me forth?
769	
770	Lord Chief-Justice	Not a penny, not a penny; you are too impatient to
771	bear crosses. Fare you well: commend me to my
772	cousin Westmoreland.
773	
774	[Exeunt Chief-Justice and Servant]
775	
776	FALSTAFF	If I do, fillip me with a three-man beetle. A man
777	can no more separate age and covetousness than a'
778	can part young limbs and lechery: but the gout
779	galls the one, and the pox pinches the other; and
780	so both the degrees prevent my curses. Boy!
781	
782	Page	Sir?
783	
784	FALSTAFF	What money is in my purse?
785	
786	Page	Seven groats and two pence.
787	
788	FALSTAFF	I can get no remedy against this consumption of the
789	purse: borrowing only lingers and lingers it out,
790	but the disease is incurable. Go bear this letter
791	to my Lord of Lancaster; this to the prince; this
792	to the Earl of Westmoreland; and this to old
793	Mistress Ursula, whom I have weekly sworn to marry
794	since I perceived the first white hair on my chin.
795	About it: you know where to find me.
796	
797	[Exit Page]
798	
799	A pox of this gout! or, a gout of this pox! for
800	the one or the other plays the rogue with my great
801	toe. 'Tis no matter if I do halt; I have the wars
802	for my colour, and my pension shall seem the more
803	reasonable. A good wit will make use of any thing:
804	I will turn diseases to commodity.

811	2 KING HENRY IV
812	
813	
814	ACT I
815	
816	
817	
818	SCENE III	York. The Archbishop's palace.
819	
820	
821	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, the Lords HASTINGS,
822	MOWBRAY, and BARDOLPH]
823	
824	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Thus have you heard our cause and known our means;
825	And, my most noble friends, I pray you all,
826	Speak plainly your opinions of our hopes:
827	And first, lord marshal, what say you to it?
828	
829	MOWBRAY	I well allow the occasion of our arms;
830	But gladly would be better satisfied
831	How in our means we should advance ourselves
832	To look with forehead bold and big enough
833	Upon the power and puissance of the king.
834	
835	HASTINGS	Our present musters grow upon the file
836	To five and twenty thousand men of choice;
837	And our supplies live largely in the hope
838	Of great Northumberland, whose bosom burns
839	With an incensed fire of injuries.
840	
841	LORD BARDOLPH	The question then, Lord Hastings, standeth thus;
842	Whether our present five and twenty thousand
843	May hold up head without Northumberland?
844	
845	HASTINGS	With him, we may.
846	
847	LORD BARDOLPH	                  Yea, marry, there's the point:
848	But if without him we be thought too feeble,
849	My judgment is, we should not step too far
850	Till we had his assistance by the hand;
851	For in a theme so bloody-faced as this
852	Conjecture, expectation, and surmise
853	Of aids incertain should not be admitted.
854	
855	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	'Tis very true, Lord Bardolph; for indeed
856	It was young Hotspur's case at Shrewsbury.
857	
858	LORD BARDOLPH	It was, my lord; who lined himself with hope,
859	Eating the air on promise of supply,
860	Flattering himself in project of a power
861	Much smaller than the smallest of his thoughts:
862	And so, with great imagination
863	Proper to madmen, led his powers to death
864	And winking leap'd into destruction.
865	
866	HASTINGS	But, by your leave, it never yet did hurt
867	To lay down likelihoods and forms of hope.
868	
869	LORD BARDOLPH	Yes, if this present quality of war,
870	Indeed the instant action: a cause on foot
871	Lives so in hope as in an early spring
872	We see the appearing buds; which to prove fruit,
873	Hope gives not so much warrant as despair
874	That frosts will bite them. When we mean to build,
875	We first survey the plot, then draw the model;
876	And when we see the figure of the house,
877	Then must we rate the cost of the erection;
878	Which if we find outweighs ability,
879	What do we then but draw anew the model
880	In fewer offices, or at last desist
881	To build at all? Much more, in this great work,
882	Which is almost to pluck a kingdom down
883	And set another up, should we survey
884	The plot of situation and the model,
885	Consent upon a sure foundation,
886	Question surveyors, know our own estate,
887	How able such a work to undergo,
888	To weigh against his opposite; or else
889	We fortify in paper and in figures,
890	Using the names of men instead of men:
891	Like one that draws the model of a house
892	Beyond his power to build it; who, half through,
893	Gives o'er and leaves his part-created cost
894	A naked subject to the weeping clouds
895	And waste for churlish winter's tyranny.
896	
897	HASTINGS	Grant that our hopes, yet likely of fair birth,
898	Should be still-born, and that we now possess'd
899	The utmost man of expectation,
900	I think we are a body strong enough,
901	Even as we are, to equal with the king.
902	
903	LORD BARDOLPH	What, is the king but five and twenty thousand?
904	
905	HASTINGS	To us no more; nay, not so much, Lord Bardolph.
906	For his divisions, as the times do brawl,
907	Are in three heads: one power against the French,
908	And one against Glendower; perforce a third
909	Must take up us: so is the unfirm king
910	In three divided; and his coffers sound
911	With hollow poverty and emptiness.
912	
913	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	That he should draw his several strengths together
914	And come against us in full puissance,
915	Need not be dreaded.
916	
917	HASTINGS	If he should do so,
918	He leaves his back unarm'd, the French and Welsh
919	Baying him at the heels: never fear that.
920	
921	LORD BARDOLPH	Who is it like should lead his forces hither?
922	
923	HASTINGS	The Duke of Lancaster and Westmoreland;
924	Against the Welsh, himself and Harry Monmouth:
925	But who is substituted 'gainst the French,
926	I have no certain notice.
927	
928	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Let us on,
929	And publish the occasion of our arms.
930	The commonwealth is sick of their own choice;
931	Their over-greedy love hath surfeited:
932	An habitation giddy and unsure
933	Hath he that buildeth on the vulgar heart.
934	O thou fond many, with what loud applause
935	Didst thou beat heaven with blessing Bolingbroke,
936	Before he was what thou wouldst have him be!
937	And being now trimm'd in thine own desires,
938	Thou, beastly feeder, art so full of him,
939	That thou provokest thyself to cast him up.
940	So, so, thou common dog, didst thou disgorge
941	Thy glutton bosom of the royal Richard;
942	And now thou wouldst eat thy dead vomit up,
943	And howl'st to find it. What trust is in
944	these times?
945	They that, when Richard lived, would have him die,
946	Are now become enamour'd on his grave:
947	Thou, that threw'st dust upon his goodly head
948	When through proud London he came sighing on
949	After the admired heels of Bolingbroke,
950	Criest now 'O earth, yield us that king again,
951	And take thou this!' O thoughts of men accursed!
952	Past and to come seems best; things present worst.
953	
954	MOWBRAY	Shall we go draw our numbers and set on?
955	
956	HASTINGS	We are time's subjects, and time bids be gone.
957

965	
966	ACT II
967	
968	
969	
970	SCENE I	London. A street.
971	
972	
973	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY, FANG and his Boy with her,
974	and SNARE following.
975	
976	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Master Fang, have you entered the action?
977	
978	FANG	It is entered.
979	
980	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Where's your yeoman? Is't a lusty yeoman? will a'
981	stand to 't?
982	
983	FANG	Sirrah, where's Snare?
984	
985	MISTRESS QUICKLY	O Lord, ay! good Master Snare.
986	
987	SNARE	Here, here.
988	
989	FANG	Snare, we must arrest Sir John Falstaff.
990	
991	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Yea, good Master Snare; I have entered him and all.
992	
993	SNARE	It may chance cost some of us our lives, for he will stab.
994	
995	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Alas the day! take heed of him; he stabbed me in
996	mine own house, and that most beastly: in good
997	faith, he cares not what mischief he does. If his
998	weapon be out: he will foin like any devil; he will
999	spare neither man, woman, nor child.
1000	
1001	FANG	If I can close with him, I care not for his thrust.
1002	
1003	MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, nor I neither: I'll be at your elbow.
1004	
1005	FANG	An I but fist him once; an a' come but within my vice,--
1006	
1007	MISTRESS QUICKLY	I am undone by his going; I warrant you, he's an
1008	infinitive thing upon my score. Good Master Fang,
1009	hold him sure: good Master Snare, let him not
1010	'scape. A' comes continuantly to Pie-corner--saving
1011	your manhoods--to buy a saddle; and he is indited to
1012	dinner to the Lubber's-head in Lumbert street, to
1013	Master Smooth's the silkman: I pray ye, since my
1014	exion is entered and my case so openly known to the
1015	world, let him be brought in to his answer. A
1016	hundred mark is a long one for a poor lone woman to
1017	bear: and I have borne, and borne, and borne, and
1018	have been fubbed off, and fubbed off, and fubbed
1019	off, from this day to that day, that it is a shame
1020	to be thought on. There is no honesty in such
1021	dealing; unless a woman should be made an ass and a
1022	beast, to bear every knave's wrong. Yonder he
1023	comes; and that errant malmsey-nose knave, Bardolph,
1024	with him. Do your offices, do your offices: Master
1025	Fang and Master Snare, do me, do me, do me your offices.
1026	
1027	[Enter FALSTAFF, Page, and BARDOLPH]
1028	
1029	FALSTAFF	How now! whose mare's dead? what's the matter?
1030	
1031	FANG	Sir John, I arrest you at the suit of Mistress Quickly.
1032	
1033	FALSTAFF	Away, varlets! Draw, Bardolph: cut me off the
1034	villain's head: throw the quean in the channel.
1035	
1036	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Throw me in the channel! I'll throw thee in the
1037	channel. Wilt thou? wilt thou? thou bastardly
1038	rogue! Murder, murder! Ah, thou honeysuckle
1039	villain! wilt thou kill God's officers and the
1040	king's? Ah, thou honey-seed rogue! thou art a
1041	honey-seed, a man-queller, and a woman-queller.
1042	
1043	FALSTAFF	Keep them off, Bardolph.
1044	
1045	FANG	A rescue! a rescue!
1046	
1047	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good people, bring a rescue or two. Thou wo't, wo't
1048	thou? Thou wo't, wo't ta? do, do, thou rogue! do,
1049	thou hemp-seed!
1050	
1051	FALSTAFF	Away, you scullion! you rampallion! You
1052	fustilarian! I'll tickle your catastrophe.
1053	
1054	[Enter the Lord Chief-Justice, and his men]
1055	
1056	Lord Chief-Justice	What is the matter? keep the peace here, ho!
1057	
1058	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good my lord, be good to me. I beseech you, stand to me.
1059	
1060	Lord Chief-Justice	How now, Sir John! what are you brawling here?
1061	Doth this become your place, your time and business?
1062	You should have been well on your way to York.
1063	Stand from him, fellow: wherefore hang'st upon him?
1064	
1065	MISTRESS QUICKLY	O most worshipful lord, an't please your grace, I am
1066	a poor widow of Eastcheap, and he is arrested at my suit.
1067	
1068	Lord Chief-Justice	For what sum?
1069	
1070	MISTRESS QUICKLY	It is more than for some, my lord; it is for all,
1071	all I have. He hath eaten me out of house and home;
1072	he hath put all my substance into that fat belly of
1073	his: but I will have some of it out again, or I
1074	will ride thee o' nights like the mare.
1075	
1076	FALSTAFF	I think I am as like to ride the mare, if I have
1077	any vantage of ground to get up.
1078	
1079	Lord Chief-Justice	How comes this, Sir John? Fie! what man of good
1080	temper would endure this tempest of exclamation?
1081	Are you not ashamed to enforce a poor widow to so
1082	rough a course to come by her own?
1083	
1084	FALSTAFF	What is the gross sum that I owe thee?
1085	
1086	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Marry, if thou wert an honest man, thyself and the
1087	money too. Thou didst swear to me upon a
1088	parcel-gilt goblet, sitting in my Dolphin-chamber,
1089	at the round table, by a sea-coal fire, upon
1090	Wednesday in Wheeson week, when the prince broke
1091	thy head for liking his father to a singing-man of
1092	Windsor, thou didst swear to me then, as I was
1093	washing thy wound, to marry me and make me my lady
1094	thy wife. Canst thou deny it? Did not goodwife
1095	Keech, the butcher's wife, come in then and call me
1096	gossip Quickly? coming in to borrow a mess of
1097	vinegar; telling us she had a good dish of prawns;
1098	whereby thou didst desire to eat some; whereby I
1099	told thee they were ill for a green wound? And
1100	didst thou not, when she was gone down stairs,
1101	desire me to be no more so familiarity with such
1102	poor people; saying that ere long they should call
1103	me madam? And didst thou not kiss me and bid me
1104	fetch thee thirty shillings? I put thee now to thy
1105	book-oath: deny it, if thou canst.
1106	
1107	FALSTAFF	My lord, this is a poor mad soul; and she says up
1108	and down the town that the eldest son is like you:
1109	she hath been in good case, and the truth is,
1110	poverty hath distracted her. But for these foolish
1111	officers, I beseech you I may have redress against them.
1112	
1113	Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, Sir John, I am well acquainted with your
1114	manner of wrenching the true cause the false way. It
1115	is not a confident brow, nor the throng of words
1116	that come with such more than impudent sauciness
1117	from you, can thrust me from a level consideration:
1118	you have, as it appears to me, practised upon the
1119	easy-yielding spirit of this woman, and made her
1120	serve your uses both in purse and in person.
1121	
1122	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Yea, in truth, my lord.
1123	
1124	Lord Chief-Justice	Pray thee, peace. Pay her the debt you owe her, and
1125	unpay the villany you have done her: the one you
1126	may do with sterling money, and the other with
1127	current repentance.
1128	
1129	FALSTAFF	My lord, I will not undergo this sneap without
1130	reply. You call honourable boldness impudent
1131	sauciness: if a man will make courtesy and say
1132	nothing, he is virtuous: no, my lord, my humble
1133	duty remembered, I will not be your suitor. I say
1134	to you, I do desire deliverance from these officers,
1135	being upon hasty employment in the king's affairs.
1136	
1137	Lord Chief-Justice	You speak as having power to do wrong: but answer
1138	in the effect of your reputation, and satisfy this
1139	poor woman.
1140	
1141	FALSTAFF	Come hither, hostess.
1142	
1143	[Enter GOWER]
1144	
1145	Lord Chief-Justice	Now, Master Gower, what news?
1146	
1147	GOWER	The king, my lord, and Harry Prince of Wales
1148	Are near at hand: the rest the paper tells.
1149	
1150	FALSTAFF	As I am a gentleman.
1151	
1152	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Faith, you said so before.
1153	
1154	FALSTAFF	As I am a gentleman. Come, no more words of it.
1155	
1156	MISTRESS QUICKLY	By this heavenly ground I tread on, I must be fain
1157	to pawn both my plate and the tapestry of my
1158	dining-chambers.
1159	
1160	FALSTAFF	Glasses, glasses is the only drinking: and for thy
1161	walls, a pretty slight drollery, or the story of
1162	the Prodigal, or the German hunting in water-work,
1163	is worth a thousand of these bed-hangings and these
1164	fly-bitten tapestries. Let it be ten pound, if thou
1165	canst. Come, an 'twere not for thy humours, there's
1166	not a better wench in England. Go, wash thy face,
1167	and draw the action. Come, thou must not be in
1168	this humour with me; dost not know me? come, come, I
1169	know thou wast set on to this.
1170	
1171	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Pray thee, Sir John, let it be but twenty nobles: i'
1172	faith, I am loath to pawn my plate, so God save me,
1173	la!
1174	
1175	FALSTAFF	Let it alone; I'll make other shift: you'll be a
1176	fool still.
1177	
1178	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, you shall have it, though I pawn my gown. I
1179	hope you'll come to supper. You'll pay me all together?
1180	
1181	FALSTAFF	Will I live?
1182	
1183	[To BARDOLPH]
1184	
1185	Go, with her, with her; hook on, hook on.
1186	
1187	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Will you have Doll Tearsheet meet you at supper?
1188	
1189	FALSTAFF	No more words; let's have her.
1190	
1191	[Exeunt MISTRESS QUICKLY, BARDOLPH, Officers and Boy]
1192	
1193	Lord Chief-Justice	I have heard better news.
1194	
1195	FALSTAFF	What's the news, my lord?
1196	
1197	Lord Chief-Justice	Where lay the king last night?
1198	
1199	GOWER	At Basingstoke, my lord.
1200	
1201	FALSTAFF	I hope, my lord, all's well: what is the news, my lord?
1202	
1203	Lord Chief-Justice	Come all his forces back?
1204	
1205	GOWER	No; fifteen hundred foot, five hundred horse,
1206	Are marched up to my lord of Lancaster,
1207	Against Northumberland and the Archbishop.
1208	
1209	FALSTAFF	Comes the king back from Wales, my noble lord?
1210	
1211	Lord Chief-Justice	You shall have letters of me presently:
1212	Come, go along with me, good Master Gower.
1213	
1214	FALSTAFF	My lord!
1215	
1216	Lord Chief-Justice	What's the matter?
1217	
1218	FALSTAFF	Master Gower, shall I entreat you with me to dinner?
1219	
1220	GOWER	I must wait upon my good lord here; I thank you,
1221	good Sir John.
1222	
1223	Lord Chief-Justice	Sir John, you loiter here too long, being you are to
1224	take soldiers up in counties as you go.
1225	
1226	FALSTAFF	Will you sup with me, Master Gower?
1227	
1228	Lord Chief-Justice	What foolish master taught you these manners, Sir John?
1229	
1230	FALSTAFF	Master Gower, if they become me not, he was a fool
1231	that taught them me. This is the right fencing
1232	grace, my lord; tap for tap, and so part fair.
1233	
1234	Lord Chief-Justice	Now the Lord lighten thee! thou art a great fool.

1246	
1247	
1248	SCENE II	London. Another street.
1249	
1250	
1251	[Enter PRINCE HENRY and POINS]
1252	
1253	PRINCE HENRY	Before God, I am exceeding weary.
1254	
1255	POINS	Is't come to that? I had thought weariness durst not
1256	have attached one of so high blood.
1257	
1258	PRINCE HENRY	Faith, it does me; though it discolours the
1259	complexion of my greatness to acknowledge it. Doth
1260	it not show vilely in me to desire small beer?
1261	
1262	POINS	Why, a prince should not be so loosely studied as
1263	to remember so weak a composition.
1264	
1265	PRINCE HENRY	Belike then my appetite was not princely got; for,
1266	by my troth, I do now remember the poor creature,
1267	small beer. But, indeed, these humble
1268	considerations make me out of love with my
1269	greatness. What a disgrace is it to me to remember
1270	thy name! or to know thy face to-morrow! or to
1271	take note how many pair of silk stockings thou
1272	hast, viz. these, and those that were thy
1273	peach-coloured ones! or to bear the inventory of thy
1274	shirts, as, one for superfluity, and another for
1275	use! But that the tennis-court-keeper knows better
1276	than I; for it is a low ebb of linen with thee when
1277	thou keepest not racket there; as thou hast not done
1278	a great while, because the rest of thy low
1279	countries have made a shift to eat up thy holland:
1280	and God knows, whether those that bawl out the ruins
1281	of thy linen shall inherit his kingdom: but the
1282	midwives say the children are not in the fault;
1283	whereupon the world increases, and kindreds are
1284	mightily strengthened.
1285	
1286	POINS	How ill it follows, after you have laboured so hard,
1287	you should talk so idly! Tell me, how many good
1288	young princes would do so, their fathers being so
1289	sick as yours at this time is?
1290	
1291	PRINCE HENRY	Shall I tell thee one thing, Poins?
1292	
1293	POINS	Yes, faith; and let it be an excellent good thing.
1294	
1295	PRINCE HENRY	It shall serve among wits of no higher breeding than thine.
1296	
1297	POINS	Go to; I stand the push of your one thing that you
1298	will tell.
1299	
1300	PRINCE HENRY	Marry, I tell thee, it is not meet that I should be
1301	sad, now my father is sick: albeit I could tell
1302	thee, as to one it pleases me, for fault of a
1303	better, to call my friend, I could be sad, and sad
1304	indeed too.
1305	
1306	POINS	Very hardly upon such a subject.
1307	
1308	PRINCE HENRY	By this hand thou thinkest me as far in the devil's
1309	book as thou and Falstaff for obduracy and
1310	persistency: let the end try the man. But I tell
1311	thee, my heart bleeds inwardly that my father is so
1312	sick: and keeping such vile company as thou art
1313	hath in reason taken from me all ostentation of sorrow.
1314	
1315	POINS	The reason?
1316	
1317	PRINCE HENRY	What wouldst thou think of me, if I should weep?
1318	
1319	POINS	I would think thee a most princely hypocrite.
1320	
1321	PRINCE HENRY	It would be every man's thought; and thou art a
1322	blessed fellow to think as every man thinks: never
1323	a man's thought in the world keeps the road-way
1324	better than thine: every man would think me an
1325	hypocrite indeed. And what accites your most
1326	worshipful thought to think so?
1327	
1328	POINS	Why, because you have been so lewd and so much
1329	engraffed to Falstaff.
1330	
1331	PRINCE HENRY	And to thee.
1332	
1333	POINS	By this light, I am well spoke on; I can hear it
1334	with my own ears: the worst that they can say of
1335	me is that I am a second brother and that I am a
1336	proper fellow of my hands; and those two things, I
1337	confess, I cannot help. By the mass, here comes Bardolph.
1338	
1339	[Enter BARDOLPH and Page]
1340	
1341	PRINCE HENRY	And the boy that I gave Falstaff: a' had him from
1342	me Christian; and look, if the fat villain have not
1343	transformed him ape.
1344	
1345	BARDOLPH	God save your grace!
1346	
1347	PRINCE HENRY	And yours, most noble Bardolph!
1348	
1349	BARDOLPH	Come, you virtuous ass, you bashful fool, must you
1350	be blushing? wherefore blush you now? What a
1351	maidenly man-at-arms are you become! Is't such a
1352	matter to get a pottle-pot's maidenhead?
1353	
1354	Page	A' calls me e'en now, my lord, through a red
1355	lattice, and I could discern no part of his face
1356	from the window: at last I spied his eyes, and
1357	methought he had made two holes in the ale-wife's
1358	new petticoat and so peeped through.
1359	
1360	PRINCE HENRY	Has not the boy profited?
1361	
1362	BARDOLPH	Away, you whoreson upright rabbit, away!
1363	
1364	Page	Away, you rascally Althaea's dream, away!
1365	
1366	PRINCE HENRY	Instruct us, boy; what dream, boy?
1367	
1368	Page	Marry, my lord, Althaea dreamed she was delivered
1369	of a fire-brand; and therefore I call him her dream.
1370	
1371	PRINCE HENRY	A crown's worth of good interpretation: there 'tis,
1372	boy.
1373	
1374	POINS	O, that this good blossom could be kept from
1375	cankers! Well, there is sixpence to preserve thee.
1376	
1377	BARDOLPH	An you do not make him hanged among you, the
1378	gallows shall have wrong.
1379	
1380	PRINCE HENRY	And how doth thy master, Bardolph?
1381	
1382	BARDOLPH	Well, my lord. He heard of your grace's coming to
1383	town: there's a letter for you.
1384	
1385	POINS	Delivered with good respect. And how doth the
1386	martlemas, your master?
1387	
1388	BARDOLPH	In bodily health, sir.
1389	
1390	POINS	Marry, the immortal part needs a physician; but
1391	that moves not him: though that be sick, it dies
1392	not.
1393	
1394	PRINCE HENRY	I do allow this wen to be as familiar with me as my
1395	dog; and he holds his place; for look you how be writes.
1396	
1397	POINS	[Reads]  'John Falstaff, knight,'--every man must
1398	know that, as oft as he has occasion to name
1399	himself: even like those that are kin to the king;
1400	for they never prick their finger but they say,
1401	'There's some of the king's blood spilt.' 'How
1402	comes that?' says he, that takes upon him not to
1403	conceive. The answer is as ready as a borrower's
1404	cap, 'I am the king's poor cousin, sir.'
1405	
1406	PRINCE HENRY	Nay, they will be kin to us, or they will fetch it
1407	from Japhet. But to the letter.
1408	
1409	POINS	[Reads]  'Sir John Falstaff, knight, to the son of
1410	the king, nearest his father, Harry Prince of
1411	Wales, greeting.' Why, this is a certificate.
1412	
1413	PRINCE HENRY	Peace!
1414	
1415	POINS	[Reads]  'I will imitate the honourable Romans in
1416	brevity:' he sure means brevity in breath,
1417	short-winded. 'I commend me to thee, I commend
1418	thee, and I leave thee. Be not too familiar with
1419	Poins; for he misuses thy favours so much, that he
1420	swears thou art to marry his sister Nell. Repent
1421	at idle times as thou mayest; and so, farewell.
1422	Thine, by yea and no, which is as much as to
1423	say, as thou usest him, JACK FALSTAFF with my
1424	familiars, JOHN with my brothers and sisters,
1425	and SIR JOHN with all Europe.'
1426	My lord, I'll steep this letter in sack and make him eat it.
1427	
1428	PRINCE HENRY	That's to make him eat twenty of his words. But do
1429	you use me thus, Ned? must I marry your sister?
1430	
1431	POINS	God send the wench no worse fortune! But I never said so.
1432	
1433	PRINCE HENRY	Well, thus we play the fools with the time, and the
1434	spirits of the wise sit in the clouds and mock us.
1435	Is your master here in London?
1436	
1437	BARDOLPH	Yea, my lord.
1438	
1439	PRINCE HENRY	Where sups he? doth the old boar feed in the old frank?
1440	
1441	BARDOLPH	At the old place, my lord, in Eastcheap.
1442	
1443	PRINCE HENRY	What company?
1444	
1445	Page	Ephesians, my lord, of the old church.
1446	
1447	PRINCE HENRY	Sup any women with him?
1448	
1449	Page	None, my lord, but old Mistress Quickly and
1450	Mistress Doll Tearsheet.
1451	
1452	PRINCE HENRY	What pagan may that be?
1453	
1454	Page	A proper gentlewoman, sir, and a kinswoman of my master's.
1455	
1456	PRINCE HENRY	Even such kin as the parish heifers are to the town
1457	bull. Shall we steal upon them, Ned, at supper?
1458	
1459	POINS	I am your shadow, my lord; I'll follow you.
1460	
1461	PRINCE HENRY	Sirrah, you boy, and Bardolph, no word to your
1462	master that I am yet come to town: there's for
1463	your silence.
1464	
1465	BARDOLPH	I have no tongue, sir.
1466	
1467	Page	And for mine, sir, I will govern it.
1468	
1469	PRINCE HENRY	Fare you well; go.
1470	
1471	[Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page]
1472	
1473	This Doll Tearsheet should be some road.
1474	
1475	POINS	I warrant you, as common as the way between Saint
1476	Alban's and London.
1477	
1478	PRINCE HENRY	How might we see Falstaff bestow himself to-night
1479	in his true colours, and not ourselves be seen?
1480	
1481	POINS	Put on two leathern jerkins and aprons, and wait
1482	upon him at his table as drawers.
1483	
1484	PRINCE HENRY	From a God to a bull? a heavy decension! it was
1485	Jove's case. From a prince to a prentice? a low
1486	transformation! that shall be mine; for in every
1487	thing the purpose must weigh with the folly.

1506	
1507	NORTHUMBERLAND	I pray thee, loving wife, and gentle daughter,
1508	Give even way unto my rough affairs:
1509	Put not you on the visage of the times
1510	And be like them to Percy troublesome.
1511	
1512	LADY
1513	NORTHUMBERLAND	I have given over, I will speak no more:
1514	Do what you will; your wisdom be your guide.
1515	
1516	NORTHUMBERLAND	Alas, sweet wife, my honour is at pawn;
1517	And, but my going, nothing can redeem it.
1518	
1519	LADY PERCY	O yet, for God's sake, go not to these wars!
1520	The time was, father, that you broke your word,
1521	When you were more endeared to it than now;
1522	When your own Percy, when my heart's dear Harry,
1523	Threw many a northward look to see his father
1524	Bring up his powers; but he did long in vain.
1525	Who then persuaded you to stay at home?
1526	There were two honours lost, yours and your son's.
1527	For yours, the God of heaven brighten it!
1528	For his, it stuck upon him as the sun
1529	In the grey vault of heaven, and by his light
1530	Did all the chivalry of England move
1531	To do brave acts: he was indeed the glass
1532	Wherein the noble youth did dress themselves:
1533	He had no legs that practised not his gait;
1534	And speaking thick, which nature made his blemish,
1535	Became the accents of the valiant;
1536	For those that could speak low and tardily
1537	Would turn their own perfection to abuse,
1538	To seem like him: so that in speech, in gait,
1539	In diet, in affections of delight,
1540	In military rules, humours of blood,
1541	He was the mark and glass, copy and book,
1542	That fashion'd others. And him, O wondrous him!
1543	O miracle of men! him did you leave,
1544	Second to none, unseconded by you,
1545	To look upon the hideous god of war
1546	In disadvantage; to abide a field
1547	Where nothing but the sound of Hotspur's name
1548	Did seem defensible: so you left him.
1549	Never, O never, do his ghost the wrong
1550	To hold your honour more precise and nice
1551	With others than with him! let them alone:
1552	The marshal and the archbishop are strong:
1553	Had my sweet Harry had but half their numbers,
1554	To-day might I, hanging on Hotspur's neck,
1555	Have talk'd of Monmouth's grave.
1556	
1557	NORTHUMBERLAND	Beshrew your heart,
1558	Fair daughter, you do draw my spirits from me
1559	With new lamenting ancient oversights.
1560	But I must go and meet with danger there,
1561	Or it will seek me in another place
1562	And find me worse provided.
1563	
1564	LADY
1565	NORTHUMBERLAND	O, fly to Scotland,
1566	Till that the nobles and the armed commons
1567	Have of their puissance made a little taste.
1568	
1569	LADY PERCY	If they get ground and vantage of the king,
1570	Then join you with them, like a rib of steel,
1571	To make strength stronger; but, for all our loves,
1572	First let them try themselves. So did your son;
1573	He was so suffer'd: so came I a widow;
1574	And never shall have length of life enough
1575	To rain upon remembrance with mine eyes,
1576	That it may grow and sprout as high as heaven,
1577	For recordation to my noble husband.
1578	
1579	NORTHUMBERLAND	Come, come, go in with me. 'Tis with my mind
1580	As with the tide swell'd up unto his height,
1581	That makes a still-stand, running neither way:
1582	Fain would I go to meet the archbishop,
1583	But many thousand reasons hold me back.

1600	
1601	
1602	[Enter two Drawers]
1603	
1604	First Drawer	What the devil hast thou brought there? apple-johns?
1605	thou knowest Sir John cannot endure an apple-john.
1606	
1607	Second Drawer	Mass, thou sayest true. The prince once set a dish
1608	of apple-johns before him, and told him there were
1609	five more Sir Johns, and, putting off his hat, said
1610	'I will now take my leave of these six dry, round,
1611	old, withered knights.' It angered him to the
1612	heart: but he hath forgot that.
1613	
1614	First Drawer	Why, then, cover, and set them down: and see if
1615	thou canst find out Sneak's noise; Mistress
1616	Tearsheet would fain hear some music. Dispatch: the
1617	room where they supped is too hot; they'll come in straight.
1618	
1619	Second Drawer	Sirrah, here will be the prince and Master Poins
1620	anon; and they will put on two of our jerkins and
1621	aprons; and Sir John must not know of it: Bardolph
1622	hath brought word.
1623	
1624	First Drawer	By the mass, here will be old Utis: it will be an
1625	excellent stratagem.
1626	
1627	Second Drawer	I'll see if I can find out Sneak.
1628	
1629	[Exit]
1630	
1631	[Enter MISTRESS QUICKLY and DOLL TEARSHEET]
1632	
1633	MISTRESS QUICKLY	I' faith, sweetheart, methinks now you are in an
1634	excellent good temperality: your pulsidge beats as
1635	extraordinarily as heart would desire; and your
1636	colour, I warrant you, is as red as any rose, in good
1637	truth, la! But, i' faith, you have drunk too much
1638	canaries; and that's a marvellous searching wine,
1639	and it perfumes the blood ere one can say 'What's
1640	this?' How do you now?
1641	
1642	DOLL TEARSHEET	Better than I was: hem!
1643	
1644	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Why, that's well said; a good heart's worth gold.
1645	Lo, here comes Sir John.
1646	
1647	[Enter FALSTAFF]
1648	
1649	FALSTAFF	[Singing]  'When Arthur first in court,'
1650	--Empty the jordan.
1651	
1652	[Exit First Drawer]
1653	
1654	[Singing]
1655	
1656	--'And was a worthy king.' How now, Mistress Doll!
1657	
1658	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Sick of a calm; yea, good faith.
1659	
1660	FALSTAFF	So is all her sect; an they be once in a calm, they are sick.
1661	
1662	DOLL TEARSHEET	You muddy rascal, is that all the comfort you give me?
1663	
1664	FALSTAFF	You make fat rascals, Mistress Doll.
1665	
1666	DOLL TEARSHEET	I make them! gluttony and diseases make them; I
1667	make them not.
1668	
1669	FALSTAFF	If the cook help to make the gluttony, you help to
1670	make the diseases, Doll: we catch of you, Doll, we
1671	catch of you; grant that, my poor virtue grant that.
1672	
1673	DOLL TEARSHEET	Yea, joy, our chains and our jewels.
1674	
1675	FALSTAFF	'Your broaches, pearls, and ouches:' for to serve
1676	bravely is to come halting off, you know: to come
1677	off the breach with his pike bent bravely, and to
1678	surgery bravely; to venture upon the charged
1679	chambers bravely,--
1680	
1681	DOLL TEARSHEET	Hang yourself, you muddy conger, hang yourself!
1682	
1683	MISTRESS QUICKLY	By my troth, this is the old fashion; you two never
1684	meet but you fall to some discord: you are both,
1685	i' good truth, as rheumatic as two dry toasts; you
1686	cannot one bear with another's confirmities. What
1687	the good-year! one must bear, and that must be
1688	you: you are the weaker vessel, as they say, the
1689	emptier vessel.
1690	
1691	DOLL TEARSHEET	Can a weak empty vessel bear such a huge full
1692	hogshead? there's a whole merchant's venture of
1693	Bourdeaux stuff in him; you have not seen a hulk
1694	better stuffed in the hold. Come, I'll be friends
1695	with thee, Jack: thou art going to the wars; and
1696	whether I shall ever see thee again or no, there is
1697	nobody cares.
1698	
1699	[Re-enter First Drawer]
1700	
1701	First Drawer	Sir, Ancient Pistol's below, and would speak with
1702	you.
1703	
1704	DOLL TEARSHEET	Hang him, swaggering rascal! let him not come
1705	hither: it is the foul-mouthed'st rogue in England.
1706	
1707	MISTRESS QUICKLY	If he swagger, let him not come here: no, by my
1708	faith; I must live among my neighbours: I'll no
1709	swaggerers: I am in good name and fame with the
1710	very best: shut the door; there comes no swaggerers
1711	here: I have not lived all this while, to have
1712	swaggering now: shut the door, I pray you.
1713	
1714	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear, hostess?
1715	
1716	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Pray ye, pacify yourself, Sir John: there comes no
1717	swaggerers here.
1718	
1719	FALSTAFF	Dost thou hear? it is mine ancient.
1720	
1721	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Tilly-fally, Sir John, ne'er tell me: your ancient
1722	swaggerer comes not in my doors. I was before Master
1723	Tisick, the debuty, t'other day; and, as he said to
1724	me, 'twas no longer ago than Wednesday last, 'I'
1725	good faith, neighbour Quickly,' says he; Master
1726	Dumbe, our minister, was by then; 'neighbour
1727	Quickly,' says he, 'receive those that are civil;
1728	for,' said he, 'you are in an ill name:' now a'
1729	said so, I can tell whereupon; 'for,' says he, 'you
1730	are an honest woman, and well thought on; therefore
1731	take heed what guests you receive: receive,' says
1732	he, 'no swaggering companions.' There comes none
1733	here: you would bless you to hear what he said:
1734	no, I'll no swaggerers.
1735	
1736	FALSTAFF	He's no swaggerer, hostess; a tame cheater, i'
1737	faith; you may stroke him as gently as a puppy
1738	greyhound: he'll not swagger with a Barbary hen, if
1739	her feathers turn back in any show of resistance.
1740	Call him up, drawer.
1741	
1742	[Exit First Drawer]
1743	
1744	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Cheater, call you him? I will bar no honest man my
1745	house, nor no cheater: but I do not love
1746	swaggering, by my troth; I am the worse, when one
1747	says swagger: feel, masters, how I shake; look you,
1748	I warrant you.
1749	
1750	DOLL TEARSHEET	So you do, hostess.
1751	
1752	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Do I? yea, in very truth, do I, an 'twere an aspen
1753	leaf: I cannot abide swaggerers.
1754	
1755	[Enter PISTOL, BARDOLPH, and Page]
1756	
1757	PISTOL	God save you, Sir John!
1758	
1759	FALSTAFF	Welcome, Ancient Pistol. Here, Pistol, I charge
1760	you with a cup of sack: do you discharge upon mine hostess.
1761	
1762	PISTOL	I will discharge upon her, Sir John, with two bullets.
1763	
1764	FALSTAFF	She is Pistol-proof, sir; you shall hardly offend
1765	her.
1766	
1767	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Come, I'll drink no proofs nor no bullets: I'll
1768	drink no more than will do me good, for no man's
1769	pleasure, I.
1770	
1771	PISTOL	Then to you, Mistress Dorothy; I will charge you.
1772	
1773	DOLL TEARSHEET	Charge me! I scorn you, scurvy companion. What!
1774	you poor, base, rascally, cheating, lack-linen
1775	mate! Away, you mouldy rogue, away! I am meat for
1776	your master.
1777	
1778	PISTOL	I know you, Mistress Dorothy.
1779	
1780	DOLL TEARSHEET	Away, you cut-purse rascal! you filthy bung, away!
1781	by this wine, I'll thrust my knife in your mouldy
1782	chaps, an you play the saucy cuttle with me. Away,
1783	you bottle-ale rascal! you basket-hilt stale
1784	juggler, you! Since when, I pray you, sir? God's
1785	light, with two points on your shoulder? much!
1786	
1787	PISTOL	God let me not live, but I will murder your ruff for this.
1788	
1789	FALSTAFF	No more, Pistol; I would not have you go off here:
1790	discharge yourself of our company, Pistol.
1791	
1792	MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, Good Captain Pistol; not here, sweet captain.
1793	
1794	DOLL TEARSHEET	Captain! thou abominable damned cheater, art thou
1795	not ashamed to be called captain? An captains were
1796	of my mind, they would truncheon you out, for
1797	taking their names upon you before you have earned
1798	them. You a captain! you slave, for what? for
1799	tearing a poor whore's ruff in a bawdy-house? He a
1800	captain! hang him, rogue! he lives upon mouldy
1801	stewed prunes and dried cakes. A captain! God's
1802	light, these villains will make the word as odious
1803	as the word 'occupy;' which was an excellent good
1804	word before it was ill sorted: therefore captains
1805	had need look to 't.
1806	
1807	BARDOLPH	Pray thee, go down, good ancient.
1808	
1809	FALSTAFF	Hark thee hither, Mistress Doll.
1810	
1811	PISTOL	Not I	I tell thee what, Corporal Bardolph, I could
1812	tear her: I'll be revenged of her.
1813	
1814	Page	Pray thee, go down.
1815	
1816	PISTOL	I'll see her damned first; to Pluto's damned lake,
1817	by this hand, to the infernal deep, with Erebus and
1818	tortures vile also. Hold hook and line, say I.
1819	Down, down, dogs! down, faitors! Have we not
1820	Hiren here?
1821	
1822	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Good Captain Peesel, be quiet; 'tis very late, i'
1823	faith: I beseek you now, aggravate your choler.
1824	
1825	PISTOL	These be good humours, indeed! Shall pack-horses
1826	And hollow pamper'd jades of Asia,
1827	Which cannot go but thirty mile a-day,
1828	Compare with Caesars, and with Cannibals,
1829	And Trojan Greeks? nay, rather damn them with
1830	King Cerberus; and let the welkin roar.
1831	Shall we fall foul for toys?
1832	
1833	MISTRESS QUICKLY	By my troth, captain, these are very bitter words.
1834	
1835	BARDOLPH	Be gone, good ancient: this will grow to abrawl anon.
1836	
1837	PISTOL	Die men like dogs! give crowns like pins! Have we
1838	not Heren here?
1839	
1840	MISTRESS QUICKLY	O' my word, captain, there's none such here. What
1841	the good-year! do you think I would deny her? For
1842	God's sake, be quiet.
1843	
1844	PISTOL	Then feed, and be fat, my fair Calipolis.
1845	Come, give's some sack.
1846	'Si fortune me tormente, sperato me contento.'
1847	Fear we broadsides? no, let the fiend give fire:
1848	Give me some sack: and, sweetheart, lie thou there.
1849	
1850	[Laying down his sword]
1851	
1852	Come we to full points here; and are etceteras nothing?
1853	
1854	FALSTAFF	Pistol, I would be quiet.
1855	
1856	PISTOL	Sweet knight, I kiss thy neaf: what! we have seen
1857	the seven stars.
1858	
1859	DOLL TEARSHEET	For God's sake, thrust him down stairs: I cannot
1860	endure such a fustian rascal.
1861	
1862	PISTOL	Thrust him down stairs! know we not Galloway nags?
1863	
1864	FALSTAFF	Quoit him down, Bardolph, like a shove-groat
1865	shilling: nay, an a' do nothing but speak nothing,
1866	a' shall be nothing here.
1867	
1868	BARDOLPH	Come, get you down stairs.
1869	
1870	PISTOL	What! shall we have incision? shall we imbrue?
1871	
1872	[Snatching up his sword]
1873	
1874	Then death rock me asleep, abridge my doleful days!
1875	Why, then, let grievous, ghastly, gaping wounds
1876	Untwine the Sisters Three! Come, Atropos, I say!
1877	
1878	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Here's goodly stuff toward!
1879	
1880	FALSTAFF	Give me my rapier, boy.
1881	
1882	DOLL TEARSHEET	I pray thee, Jack, I pray thee, do not draw.
1883	
1884	FALSTAFF	Get you down stairs.
1885	
1886	[Drawing, and driving PISTOL out]
1887	
1888	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Here's a goodly tumult! I'll forswear keeping
1889	house, afore I'll be in these tirrits and frights.
1890	So; murder, I warrant now. Alas, alas! put up
1891	your naked weapons, put up your naked weapons.
1892	
1893	[Exeunt PISTOL and BARDOLPH]
1894	
1895	DOLL TEARSHEET	I pray thee, Jack, be quiet; the rascal's gone.
1896	Ah, you whoreson little valiant villain, you!
1897	
1898	MISTRESS QUICKLY	He you not hurt i' the groin? methought a' made a
1899	shrewd thrust at your belly.
1900	
1901	[Re-enter BARDOLPH]
1902	
1903	FALSTAFF	Have you turned him out o' doors?
1904	
1905	BARDOLPH	Yea, sir. The rascal's drunk: you have hurt him,
1906	sir, i' the shoulder.
1907	
1908	FALSTAFF	A rascal! to brave me!
1909	
1910	DOLL TEARSHEET	Ah, you sweet little rogue, you! alas, poor ape,
1911	how thou sweatest! come, let me wipe thy face;
1912	come on, you whoreson chops: ah, rogue! i'faith, I
1913	love thee: thou art as valorous as Hector of Troy,
1914	worth five of Agamemnon, and ten times better than
1915	the Nine Worthies: ah, villain!
1916	
1917	FALSTAFF	A rascally slave! I will toss the rogue in a blanket.
1918	
1919	DOLL TEARSHEET	Do, an thou darest for thy heart: an thou dost,
1920	I'll canvass thee between a pair of sheets.
1921	
1922	[Enter Music]
1923	
1924	Page	The music is come, sir.
1925	
1926	FALSTAFF	Let them play. Play, sirs. Sit on my knee, Doll.
1927	A rascal bragging slave! the rogue fled from me
1928	like quicksilver.
1929	
1930	DOLL TEARSHEET	I' faith, and thou followedst him like a church.
1931	Thou whoreson little tidy Bartholomew boar-pig,
1932	when wilt thou leave fighting o' days and foining
1933	o' nights, and begin to patch up thine old body for heaven?
1934	
1935	[Enter, behind, PRINCE HENRY and POINS, disguised]
1936	
1937	FALSTAFF	Peace, good Doll! do not speak like a death's-head;
1938	do not bid me remember mine end.
1939	
1940	DOLL TEARSHEET	Sirrah, what humour's the prince of?
1941	
1942	FALSTAFF	A good shallow young fellow: a' would have made a
1943	good pantler, a' would ha' chipp'd bread well.
1944	
1945	DOLL TEARSHEET	They say Poins has a good wit.
1946	
1947	FALSTAFF	He a good wit? hang him, baboon! his wit's as thick
1948	as Tewksbury mustard; there's no more conceit in him
1949	than is in a mallet.
1950	
1951	DOLL TEARSHEET	Why does the prince love him so, then?
1952	
1953	FALSTAFF	Because their legs are both of a bigness, and a'
1954	plays at quoits well, and eats conger and fennel,
1955	and drinks off candles' ends for flap-dragons, and
1956	rides the wild-mare with the boys, and jumps upon
1957	joined-stools, and swears with a good grace, and
1958	wears his boots very smooth, like unto the sign of
1959	the leg, and breeds no bate with telling of discreet
1960	stories; and such other gambol faculties a' has,
1961	that show a weak mind and an able body, for the
1962	which the prince admits him: for the prince himself
1963	is such another; the weight of a hair will turn the
1964	scales between their avoirdupois.
1965	
1966	PRINCE HENRY	Would not this nave of a wheel have his ears cut off?
1967	
1968	POINS	Let's beat him before his whore.
1969	
1970	PRINCE HENRY	Look, whether the withered elder hath not his poll
1971	clawed like a parrot.
1972	
1973	POINS	Is it not strange that desire should so many years
1974	outlive performance?
1975	
1976	FALSTAFF	Kiss me, Doll.
1977	
1978	PRINCE HENRY	Saturn and Venus this year in conjunction! what
1979	says the almanac to that?
1980	
1981	POINS	And look, whether the fiery Trigon, his man, be not
1982	lisping to his master's old tables, his note-book,
1983	his counsel-keeper.
1984	
1985	FALSTAFF	Thou dost give me flattering busses.
1986	
1987	DOLL TEARSHEET	By my troth, I kiss thee with a most constant heart.
1988	
1989	FALSTAFF	I am old, I am old.
1990	
1991	DOLL TEARSHEET	I love thee better than I love e'er a scurvy young
1992	boy of them all.
1993	
1994	FALSTAFF	What stuff wilt have a kirtle of? I shall receive
1995	money o' Thursday: shalt have a cap to-morrow. A
1996	merry song, come: it grows late; we'll to bed.
1997	Thou'lt forget me when I am gone.
1998	
1999	DOLL TEARSHEET	By my troth, thou'lt set me a-weeping, an thou
2000	sayest so: prove that ever I dress myself handsome
2001	till thy return: well, harken at the end.
2002	
2003	FALSTAFF	Some sack, Francis.
2004	
2005	
2006	PRINCE HENRY	|
2007	|  Anon, anon, sir.
2008	POINS	|
2009	
2010	
2011	[Coming forward]
2012	
2013	FALSTAFF	Ha! a bastard son of the king's? And art not thou
2014	Poins his brother?
2015	
2016	PRINCE HENRY	Why, thou globe of sinful continents! what a life
2017	dost thou lead!
2018	
2019	FALSTAFF	A better than thou: I am a gentleman; thou art a drawer.
2020	
2021	PRINCE HENRY	Very true, sir; and I come to draw you out by the ears.
2022	
2023	MISTRESS QUICKLY	O, the Lord preserve thy good grace! by my troth,
2024	welcome to London. Now, the Lord bless that sweet
2025	face of thine! O, Jesu, are you come from Wales?
2026	
2027	FALSTAFF	Thou whoreson mad compound of majesty, by this light
2028	flesh and corrupt blood, thou art welcome.
2029	
2030	DOLL TEARSHEET	How, you fat fool! I scorn you.
2031	
2032	POINS	My lord, he will drive you out of your revenge and
2033	turn all to a merriment, if you take not the heat.
2034	
2035	PRINCE HENRY	You whoreson candle-mine, you, how vilely did you
2036	speak of me even now before this honest, virtuous,
2037	civil gentlewoman!
2038	
2039	MISTRESS QUICKLY	God's blessing of your good heart! and so she is,
2040	by my troth.
2041	
2042	FALSTAFF	Didst thou hear me?
2043	
2044	PRINCE HENRY	Yea, and you knew me, as you did when you ran away
2045	by Gad's-hill: you knew I was at your back, and
2046	spoke it on purpose to try my patience.
2047	
2048	FALSTAFF	No, no, no; not so; I did not think thou wast within hearing.
2049	
2050	PRINCE HENRY	I shall drive you then to confess the wilful abuse;
2051	and then I know how to handle you.
2052	
2053	FALSTAFF	No abuse, Hal, o' mine honour, no abuse.
2054	
2055	PRINCE HENRY	Not to dispraise me, and call me pantier and
2056	bread-chipper and I know not what?
2057	
2058	FALSTAFF	No abuse, Hal.
2059	
2060	POINS	No abuse?
2061	
2062	FALSTAFF	No abuse, Ned, i' the world; honest Ned, none. I
2063	dispraised him before the wicked, that the wicked
2064	might not fall in love with him; in which doing, I
2065	have done the part of a careful friend and a true
2066	subject, and thy father is to give me thanks for it.
2067	No abuse, Hal: none, Ned, none: no, faith, boys, none.
2068	
2069	PRINCE HENRY	See now, whether pure fear and entire cowardice doth
2070	not make thee wrong this virtuous gentlewoman to
2071	close with us? is she of the wicked? is thine
2072	hostess here of the wicked? or is thy boy of the
2073	wicked? or honest Bardolph, whose zeal burns in his
2074	nose, of the wicked?
2075	
2076	POINS	Answer, thou dead elm, answer.
2077	
2078	FALSTAFF	The fiend hath pricked down Bardolph irrecoverable;
2079	and his face is Lucifer's privy-kitchen, where he
2080	doth nothing but roast malt-worms. For the boy,
2081	there is a good angel about him; but the devil
2082	outbids him too.
2083	
2084	PRINCE HENRY	For the women?
2085	
2086	FALSTAFF	For one of them, she is in hell already, and burns
2087	poor souls. For the other, I owe her money, and
2088	whether she be damned for that, I know not.
2089	
2090	MISTRESS QUICKLY	No, I warrant you.
2091	
2092	FALSTAFF	No, I think thou art not; I think thou art quit for
2093	that. Marry, there is another indictment upon thee,
2094	for suffering flesh to be eaten in thy house,
2095	contrary to the law; for the which I think thou wilt howl.
2096	
2097	MISTRESS QUICKLY	All victuallers do so; what's a joint of mutton or
2098	two in a whole Lent?
2099	
2100	PRINCE HENRY	You, gentlewoman,-
2101	
2102	DOLL TEARSHEET	What says your grace?
2103	
2104	FALSTAFF	His grace says that which his flesh rebels against.
2105	
2106	[Knocking within]
2107	
2108	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Who knocks so loud at door? Look to the door there, Francis.
2109	
2110	[Enter PETO]
2111	
2112	PRINCE HENRY	Peto, how now! what news?
2113	
2114	PETO	The king your father is at Westminster:
2115	And there are twenty weak and wearied posts
2116	Come from the north: and, as I came along,
2117	I met and overtook a dozen captains,
2118	Bare-headed, sweating, knocking at the taverns,
2119	And asking every one for Sir John Falstaff.
2120	
2121	PRINCE HENRY	By heaven, Poins, I feel me much to blame,
2122	So idly to profane the precious time,
2123	When tempest of commotion, like the south
2124	Borne with black vapour, doth begin to melt
2125	And drop upon our bare unarmed heads.
2126	Give me my sword and cloak. Falstaff, good night.
2127	
2128	[Exeunt PRINCE HENRY, POINS, PETO and BARDOLPH]
2129	
2130	FALSTAFF	Now comes in the sweetest morsel of the night, and
2131	we must hence and leave it unpicked.
2132	
2133	[Knocking within]
2134	
2135	More knocking at the door!
2136	
2137	[Re-enter BARDOLPH]
2138	
2139	How now! what's the matter?
2140	
2141	BARDOLPH	You must away to court, sir, presently;
2142	A dozen captains stay at door for you.
2143	
2144	FALSTAFF	[To the Page]  Pay the musicians, sirrah. Farewell,
2145	hostess; farewell, Doll. You see, my good wenches,
2146	how men of merit are sought after: the undeserver
2147	may sleep, when the man of action is called on.
2148	Farewell good wenches: if I be not sent away post,
2149	I will see you again ere I go.
2150	
2151	DOLL TEARSHEET	I cannot speak; if my heart be not read to burst,--
2152	well, sweet Jack, have a care of thyself.
2153	
2154	FALSTAFF	Farewell, farewell.
2155	
2156	[Exeunt FALSTAFF and BARDOLPH]
2157	
2158	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Well, fare thee well: I have known thee these
2159	twenty-nine years, come peascod-time; but an
2160	honester and truer-hearted man,--well, fare thee well.
2161	
2162	BARDOLPH	[Within]  Mistress Tearsheet!
2163	
2164	MISTRESS QUICKLY	What's the matter?
2165	
2166	BARDOLPH	[Within]  Good Mistress Tearsheet, come to my master.
2167	
2168	MISTRESS QUICKLY	O, run, Doll, run; run, good Doll: come.
2169	
2170	[She comes blubbered]
2171	
2172	Yea, will you come, Doll?
2173	
2174	[Exeunt]

2179	2 KING HENRY IV
2180	
2181	
2182	ACT III
2183	
2184	
2185	
2186	SCENE I	Westminster. The palace.
2187	
2188	
2189	[Enter KING HENRY IV in his nightgown, with a Page]
2190	
2191	KING HENRY IV	Go call the Earls of Surrey and of Warwick;
2192	But, ere they come, bid them o'er-read these letters,
2193	And well consider of them; make good speed.
2194	
2195	[Exit Page]
2196	
2197	How many thousand of my poorest subjects
2198	Are at this hour asleep! O sleep, O gentle sleep,
2199	Nature's soft nurse, how have I frighted thee,
2200	That thou no more wilt weigh my eyelids down
2201	And steep my senses in forgetfulness?
2202	Why rather, sleep, liest thou in smoky cribs,
2203	Upon uneasy pallets stretching thee
2204	And hush'd with buzzing night-flies to thy slumber,
2205	Than in the perfumed chambers of the great,
2206	Under the canopies of costly state,
2207	And lull'd with sound of sweetest melody?
2208	O thou dull god, why liest thou with the vile
2209	In loathsome beds, and leavest the kingly couch
2210	A watch-case or a common 'larum-bell?
2211	Wilt thou upon the high and giddy mast
2212	Seal up the ship-boy's eyes, and rock his brains
2213	In cradle of the rude imperious surge
2214	And in the visitation of the winds,
2215	Who take the ruffian billows by the top,
2216	Curling their monstrous heads and hanging them
2217	With deafening clamour in the slippery clouds,
2218	That, with the hurly, death itself awakes?
2219	Canst thou, O partial sleep, give thy repose
2220	To the wet sea-boy in an hour so rude,
2221	And in the calmest and most stillest night,
2222	With all appliances and means to boot,
2223	Deny it to a king? Then happy low, lie down!
2224	Uneasy lies the head that wears a crown.
2225	
2226	[Enter WARWICK and SURREY]
2227	
2228	WARWICK	Many good morrows to your majesty!
2229	
2230	KING HENRY IV	Is it good morrow, lords?
2231	
2232	WARWICK	'Tis one o'clock, and past.
2233	
2234	KING HENRY IV	Why, then, good morrow to you all, my lords.
2235	Have you read o'er the letters that I sent you?
2236	
2237	WARWICK	We have, my liege.
2238	
2239	KING HENRY IV	Then you perceive the body of our kingdom
2240	How foul it is; what rank diseases grow
2241	And with what danger, near the heart of it.
2242	
2243	WARWICK	It is but as a body yet distemper'd;
2244	Which to his former strength may be restored
2245	With good advice and little medicine:
2246	My Lord Northumberland will soon be cool'd.
2247	
2248	KING HENRY IV	O God! that one might read the book of fate,
2249	And see the revolution of the times
2250	Make mountains level, and the continent,
2251	Weary of solid firmness, melt itself
2252	Into the sea! and, other times, to see
2253	The beachy girdle of the ocean
2254	Too wide for Neptune's hips; how chances mock,
2255	And changes fill the cup of alteration
2256	With divers liquors! O, if this were seen,
2257	The happiest youth, viewing his progress through,
2258	What perils past, what crosses to ensue,
2259	Would shut the book, and sit him down and die.
2260	'Tis not 'ten years gone
2261	Since Richard and Northumberland, great friends,
2262	Did feast together, and in two years after
2263	Were they at wars: it is but eight years since
2264	This Percy was the man nearest my soul,
2265	Who like a brother toil'd in my affairs
2266	And laid his love and life under my foot,
2267	Yea, for my sake, even to the eyes of Richard
2268	Gave him defiance. But which of you was by--
2269	You, cousin Nevil, as I may remember--
2270	
2271	[To WARWICK]
2272	
2273	When Richard, with his eye brimful of tears,
2274	Then cheque'd and rated by Northumberland,
2275	Did speak these words, now proved a prophecy?
2276	'Northumberland, thou ladder by the which
2277	My cousin Bolingbroke ascends my throne;'
2278	Though then, God knows, I had no such intent,
2279	But that necessity so bow'd the state
2280	That I and greatness were compell'd to kiss:
2281	'The time shall come,' thus did he follow it,
2282	'The time will come, that foul sin, gathering head,
2283	Shall break into corruption:' so went on,
2284	Foretelling this same time's condition
2285	And the division of our amity.
2286	
2287	WARWICK	There is a history in all men's lives,
2288	Figuring the nature of the times deceased;
2289	The which observed, a man may prophesy,
2290	With a near aim, of the main chance of things
2291	As yet not come to life, which in their seeds
2292	And weak beginnings lie intreasured.
2293	Such things become the hatch and brood of time;
2294	And by the necessary form of this
2295	King Richard might create a perfect guess
2296	That great Northumberland, then false to him,
2297	Would of that seed grow to a greater falseness;
2298	Which should not find a ground to root upon,
2299	Unless on you.
2300	
2301	KING HENRY IV	                  Are these things then necessities?
2302	Then let us meet them like necessities:
2303	And that same word even now cries out on us:
2304	They say the bishop and Northumberland
2305	Are fifty thousand strong.
2306	
2307	WARWICK	It cannot be, my lord;
2308	Rumour doth double, like the voice and echo,
2309	The numbers of the fear'd. Please it your grace
2310	To go to bed. Upon my soul, my lord,
2311	The powers that you already have sent forth
2312	Shall bring this prize in very easily.
2313	To comfort you the more, I have received
2314	A certain instance that Glendower is dead.
2315	Your majesty hath been this fortnight ill,
2316	And these unseason'd hours perforce must add
2317	Unto your sickness.
2318	
2319	KING HENRY IV	I will take your counsel:
2320	And were these inward wars once out of hand,
2321	We would, dear lords, unto the Holy Land.
2322

2329	
2330	
2331	ACT III
2332	
2333	
2334	
2335	SCENE II	Gloucestershire. Before SHALLOW'S house.
2336	
2337	
2338	[Enter SHALLOW and SILENCE, meeting; MOULDY,
2339	SHADOW, WART, FEEBLE, BULLCALF, a Servant or two
2340	with them]
2341	
2342	SHALLOW	Come on, come on, come on, sir; give me your hand,
2343	sir, give me your hand, sir: an early stirrer, by
2344	the rood! And how doth my good cousin Silence?
2345	
2346	SILENCE	Good morrow, good cousin Shallow.
2347	
2348	SHALLOW	And how doth my cousin, your bedfellow? and your
2349	fairest daughter and mine, my god-daughter Ellen?
2350	
2351	SILENCE	Alas, a black ousel, cousin Shallow!
2352	
2353	SHALLOW	By yea and nay, sir, I dare say my cousin William is
2354	become a good scholar: he is at Oxford still, is he not?
2355	
2356	SILENCE	Indeed, sir, to my cost.
2357	
2358	SHALLOW	A' must, then, to the inns o' court shortly. I was
2359	once of Clement's Inn, where I think they will
2360	talk of mad Shallow yet.
2361	
2362	SILENCE	You were called 'lusty Shallow' then, cousin.
2363	
2364	SHALLOW	By the mass, I was called any thing; and I would
2365	have done any thing indeed too, and roundly too.
2366	There was I, and little John Doit of Staffordshire,
2367	and black George Barnes, and Francis Pickbone, and
2368	Will Squele, a Cotswold man; you had not four such
2369	swinge-bucklers in all the inns o' court again: and
2370	I may say to you, we knew where the bona-robas were
2371	and had the best of them all at commandment. Then
2372	was Jack Falstaff, now Sir John, a boy, and page to
2373	Thomas Mowbray, Duke of Norfolk.
2374	
2375	SILENCE	This Sir John, cousin, that comes hither anon about soldiers?
2376	
2377	SHALLOW	The same Sir John, the very same. I  see him break
2378	Skogan's head at the court-gate, when a' was a
2379	crack not thus high: and the very same day did I
2380	fight with one Sampson Stockfish, a fruiterer,
2381	behind Gray's Inn. Jesu, Jesu, the mad days that I
2382	have spent! and to see how many of my old
2383	acquaintance are dead!
2384	
2385	SILENCE	We shall all follow, cousin.
2386	
2387	SHADOW	Certain, 'tis certain; very sure, very sure: death,
2388	as the Psalmist saith, is certain to all; all shall
2389	die. How a good yoke of bullocks at Stamford fair?
2390	
2391	SILENCE	By my troth, I was not there.
2392	
2393	SHALLOW	Death is certain. Is old Double of your town living
2394	yet?
2395	
2396	SILENCE	Dead, sir.
2397	
2398	SHALLOW	Jesu, Jesu, dead! a' drew a good bow; and dead! a'
2399	shot a fine shoot: John a Gaunt loved him well, and
2400	betted much money on his head. Dead! a' would have
2401	clapped i' the clout at twelve score; and carried
2402	you a forehand shaft a fourteen and fourteen and a
2403	half, that it would have done a man's heart good to
2404	see. How a score of ewes now?
2405	
2406	SILENCE	Thereafter as they be: a score of good ewes may be
2407	worth ten pounds.
2408	
2409	SHALLOW	And is old Double dead?
2410	
2411	SILENCE	Here come two of Sir John Falstaff's men, as I think.
2412	
2413	[Enter BARDOLPH and one with him]
2414	
2415	BARDOLPH	Good morrow, honest gentlemen: I beseech you, which
2416	is Justice Shallow?
2417	
2418	SHALLOW	I am Robert Shallow, sir; a poor esquire of this
2419	county, and one of the king's justices of the peace:
2420	What is your good pleasure with me?
2421	
2422	BARDOLPH	My captain, sir, commends him to you; my captain,
2423	Sir John Falstaff, a tall gentleman, by heaven, and
2424	a most gallant leader.
2425	
2426	SHALLOW	He greets me well, sir. I knew him a good backsword
2427	man. How doth the good knight? may I ask how my
2428	lady his wife doth?
2429	
2430	BARDOLPH	Sir, pardon; a soldier is better accommodated than
2431	with a wife.
2432	
2433	SHALLOW	It is well said, in faith, sir; and it is well said
2434	indeed too. Better accommodated! it is good; yea,
2435	indeed, is it: good phrases are surely, and ever
2436	were, very commendable. Accommodated! it comes of
2437	'accommodo' very good; a good phrase.
2438	
2439	BARDOLPH	Pardon me, sir; I have heard the word. Phrase call
2440	you it? by this good day, I know not the phrase;
2441	but I will maintain the word with my sword to be a
2442	soldier-like word, and a word of exceeding good
2443	command, by heaven. Accommodated; that is, when a
2444	man is, as they say, accommodated; or when a man is,
2445	being, whereby a' may be thought to be accommodated;
2446	which is an excellent thing.
2447	
2448	SHALLOW	It is very just.
2449	
2450	[Enter FALSTAFF]
2451	
2452	Look, here comes good Sir John. Give me your good
2453	hand, give me your worship's good hand: by my
2454	troth, you like well and bear your years very well:
2455	welcome, good Sir John.
2456	
2457	FALSTAFF	I am glad to see you well, good Master Robert
2458	Shallow: Master Surecard, as I think?
2459	
2460	SHALLOW	No, Sir John; it is my cousin Silence, in commission with me.
2461	
2462	FALSTAFF	Good Master Silence, it well befits you should be of
2463	the peace.
2464	
2465	SILENCE	Your good-worship is welcome.
2466	
2467	FALSTAFF	Fie! this is hot weather, gentlemen. Have you
2468	provided me here half a dozen sufficient men?
2469	
2470	SHALLOW	Marry, have we, sir. Will you sit?
2471	
2472	FALSTAFF	Let me see them, I beseech you.
2473	
2474	SHALLOW	Where's the roll? where's the roll? where's the
2475	roll? Let me see, let me see, let me see. So, so:
2476	yea, marry, sir: Ralph Mouldy! Let them appear as
2477	I call; let them do so, let them do so. Let me
2478	see; where is Mouldy?
2479	
2480	MOULDY	Here, an't please you.
2481	
2482	SHALLOW	What think you, Sir John? a good-limbed fellow;
2483	young, strong, and of good friends.
2484	
2485	FALSTAFF	Is thy name Mouldy?
2486	
2487	MOULDY	Yea, an't please you.
2488	
2489	FALSTAFF	'Tis the more time thou wert used.
2490	
2491	SHALLOW	Ha, ha, ha! most excellent, i' faith! Things that
2492	are mouldy lack use: very singular good! in faith,
2493	well said, Sir John, very well said.
2494	
2495	FALSTAFF	Prick him.
2496	
2497	MOULDY	I was pricked well enough before, an you could have
2498	let me alone: my old dame will be undone now for
2499	one to do her husbandry and her drudgery: you need
2500	not to have pricked me; there are other men fitter
2501	to go out than I.
2502	
2503	FALSTAFF	Go to: peace, Mouldy; you shall go. Mouldy, it is
2504	time you were spent.
2505	
2506	MOULDY	Spent!
2507	
2508	SHALLOW	Peace, fellow, peace; stand aside: know you where
2509	you are? For the other, Sir John: let me see:
2510	Simon Shadow!
2511	
2512	FALSTAFF	Yea, marry, let me have him to sit under: he's like
2513	to be a cold soldier.
2514	
2515	SHALLOW	Where's Shadow?
2516	
2517	SHADOW	Here, sir.
2518	
2519	FALSTAFF	Shadow, whose son art thou?
2520	
2521	SHADOW	My mother's son, sir.
2522	
2523	FALSTAFF	Thy mother's son! like enough, and thy father's
2524	shadow: so the son of the female is the shadow of
2525	the male: it is often so, indeed; but much of the
2526	father's substance!
2527	
2528	SHALLOW	Do you like him, Sir John?
2529	
2530	FALSTAFF	Shadow will serve for summer; prick him, for we have
2531	a number of shadows to fill up the muster-book.
2532	
2533	SHALLOW	Thomas Wart!
2534	
2535	FALSTAFF	Where's he?
2536	
2537	WART	Here, sir.
2538	
2539	FALSTAFF	Is thy name Wart?
2540	
2541	WART	Yea, sir.
2542	
2543	FALSTAFF	Thou art a very ragged wart.
2544	
2545	SHALLOW	Shall I prick him down, Sir John?
2546	
2547	FALSTAFF	It were superfluous; for his apparel is built upon
2548	his back and the whole frame stands upon pins:
2549	prick him no more.
2550	
2551	SHALLOW	Ha, ha, ha! you can do it, sir; you can do it: I
2552	commend you well. Francis Feeble!
2553	
2554	FEEBLE	Here, sir.
2555	
2556	FALSTAFF	What trade art thou, Feeble?
2557	
2558	FEEBLE	A woman's tailor, sir.
2559	
2560	SHALLOW	Shall I prick him, sir?
2561	
2562	FALSTAFF	You may: but if he had been a man's tailor, he'ld
2563	ha' pricked you. Wilt thou make as many holes in
2564	an enemy's battle as thou hast done in a woman's petticoat?
2565	
2566	FEEBLE	I will do my good will, sir; you can have no more.
2567	
2568	FALSTAFF	Well said, good woman's tailor! well said,
2569	courageous Feeble! thou wilt be as valiant as the
2570	wrathful dove or most magnanimous mouse. Prick the
2571	woman's tailor: well, Master Shallow; deep, Master Shallow.
2572	
2573	FEEBLE	I would Wart might have gone, sir.
2574	
2575	FALSTAFF	I would thou wert a man's tailor, that thou mightst
2576	mend him and make him fit to go. I cannot put him
2577	to a private soldier that is the leader of so many
2578	thousands: let that suffice, most forcible Feeble.
2579	
2580	FEEBLE	It shall suffice, sir.
2581	
2582	FALSTAFF	I am bound to thee, reverend Feeble. Who is next?
2583	
2584	SHALLOW	Peter Bullcalf o' the green!
2585	
2586	FALSTAFF	Yea, marry, let's see Bullcalf.
2587	
2588	BULLCALF	Here, sir.
2589	
2590	FALSTAFF	'Fore God, a likely fellow! Come, prick me Bullcalf
2591	till he roar again.
2592	
2593	BULLCALF	O Lord! good my lord captain,--
2594	
2595	FALSTAFF	What, dost thou roar before thou art pricked?
2596	
2597	BULLCALF	O Lord, sir! I am a diseased man.
2598	
2599	FALSTAFF	What disease hast thou?
2600	
2601	BULLCALF	A whoreson cold, sir, a cough, sir, which I caught
2602	with ringing in the king's affairs upon his
2603	coronation-day, sir.
2604	
2605	FALSTAFF	Come, thou shalt go to the wars in a gown; we wilt
2606	have away thy cold; and I will take such order that
2607	my friends shall ring for thee. Is here all?
2608	
2609	SHALLOW	Here is two more called than your number, you must
2610	have but four here, sir: and so, I pray you, go in
2611	with me to dinner.
2612	
2613	FALSTAFF	Come, I will go drink with you, but I cannot tarry
2614	dinner. I am glad to see you, by my troth, Master Shallow.
2615	
2616	SHALLOW	O, Sir John, do you remember since we lay all night
2617	in the windmill in Saint George's field?
2618	
2619	FALSTAFF	No more of that, good Master Shallow, no more of that.
2620	
2621	SHALLOW	Ha! 'twas a merry night. And is Jane Nightwork alive?
2622	
2623	FALSTAFF	She lives, Master Shallow.
2624	
2625	SHALLOW	She never could away with me.
2626	
2627	FALSTAFF	Never, never; she would always say she could not
2628	abide Master Shallow.
2629	
2630	SHALLOW	By the mass, I could anger her to the heart. She
2631	was then a bona-roba. Doth she hold her own well?
2632	
2633	FALSTAFF	Old, old, Master Shallow.
2634	
2635	SHALLOW	Nay, she must be old; she cannot choose but be old;
2636	certain she's old; and had Robin Nightwork by old
2637	Nightwork before I came to Clement's Inn.
2638	
2639	SILENCE	That's fifty-five year ago.
2640	
2641	SHALLOW	Ha, cousin Silence, that thou hadst seen that that
2642	this knight and I have seen! Ha, Sir John, said I well?
2643	
2644	FALSTAFF	We have heard the chimes at midnight, Master Shallow.
2645	
2646	SHALLOW	That we have, that we have, that we have; in faith,
2647	Sir John, we have: our watch-word was 'Hem boys!'
2648	Come, let's to dinner; come, let's to dinner:
2649	Jesus, the days that we have seen! Come, come.
2650	
2651	[Exeunt FALSTAFF and Justices]
2652	
2653	BULLCALF	Good Master Corporate Bardolph, stand my friend;
2654	and here's four Harry ten shillings in French crowns
2655	for you. In very truth, sir, I had as lief be
2656	hanged, sir, as go: and yet, for mine own part, sir,
2657	I do not care; but rather, because I am unwilling,
2658	and, for mine own part, have a desire to stay with
2659	my friends; else, sir, I did not care, for mine own
2660	part, so much.
2661	
2662	BARDOLPH	Go to; stand aside.
2663	
2664	MOULDY	And, good master corporal captain, for my old
2665	dame's sake, stand my friend: she has nobody to do
2666	any thing about her when I am gone; and she is old,
2667	and cannot help herself: You shall have forty, sir.
2668	
2669	BARDOLPH	Go to; stand aside.
2670	
2671	FEEBLE	By my troth, I care not; a man can die but once: we
2672	owe God a death: I'll ne'er bear a base mind:
2673	an't be my destiny, so; an't be not, so: no man is
2674	too good to serve's prince; and let it go which way
2675	it will, he that dies this year is quit for the next.
2676	
2677	BARDOLPH	Well said; thou'rt a good fellow.
2678	
2679	FEEBLE	Faith, I'll bear no base mind.
2680	
2681	[Re-enter FALSTAFF and the Justices]
2682	
2683	FALSTAFF	Come, sir, which men shall I have?
2684	
2685	SHALLOW	Four of which you please.
2686	
2687	BARDOLPH	Sir, a word with you: I have three pound to free
2688	Mouldy and Bullcalf.
2689	
2690	FALSTAFF	Go to; well.
2691	
2692	SHALLOW	Come, Sir John, which four will you have?
2693	
2694	FALSTAFF	Do you choose for me.
2695	
2696	SHALLOW	Marry, then, Mouldy, Bullcalf, Feeble and Shadow.
2697	
2698	FALSTAFF	Mouldy and Bullcalf: for you, Mouldy, stay at home
2699	till you are past service: and for your part,
2700	Bullcalf, grow till you come unto it: I will none of you.
2701	
2702	SHALLOW	Sir John, Sir John, do not yourself wrong: they are
2703	your likeliest men, and I would have you served with the best.
2704	
2705	FALSTAFF	Will you tell me, Master Shallow, how to choose a
2706	man? Care I for the limb, the thewes, the stature,
2707	bulk, and big assemblance of a man! Give me the
2708	spirit, Master Shallow. Here's Wart; you see what a
2709	ragged appearance it is; a' shall charge you and
2710	discharge you with the motion of a pewterer's
2711	hammer, come off and on swifter than he that gibbets
2712	on the brewer's bucket. And this same half-faced
2713	fellow, Shadow; give me this man: he presents no
2714	mark to the enemy; the foeman may with as great aim
2715	level at the edge of a penknife. And for a retreat;
2716	how swiftly will this Feeble the woman's tailor run
2717	off! O, give me the spare men, and spare me the
2718	great ones. Put me a caliver into Wart's hand, Bardolph.
2719	
2720	BARDOLPH	Hold, Wart, traverse; thus, thus, thus.
2721	
2722	FALSTAFF	Come, manage me your caliver. So: very well: go
2723	to: very good, exceeding good. O, give me always a
2724	little, lean, old, chapt, bald shot. Well said, i'
2725	faith, Wart; thou'rt a good scab: hold, there's a
2726	tester for thee.
2727	
2728	SHALLOW	He is not his craft's master; he doth not do it
2729	right. I remember at Mile-end Green, when I lay at
2730	Clement's Inn--I was then Sir Dagonet in Arthur's
2731	show,--there was a little quiver fellow, and a'
2732	would manage you his piece thus; and a' would about
2733	and about, and come you in and come you in: 'rah,
2734	tah, tah,' would a' say; 'bounce' would a' say; and
2735	away again would a' go, and again would a' come: I
2736	shall ne'er see such a fellow.
2737	
2738	FALSTAFF	These fellows will do well, Master Shallow. God
2739	keep you, Master Silence: I will not use many words
2740	with you. Fare you well, gentlemen both: I thank
2741	you: I must a dozen mile to-night. Bardolph, give
2742	the soldiers coats.
2743	
2744	SHALLOW	Sir John, the Lord bless you! God prosper your
2745	affairs! God send us peace! At your return visit
2746	our house; let our old acquaintance be renewed;
2747	peradventure I will with ye to the court.
2748	
2749	FALSTAFF	'Fore God, I would you would, Master Shallow.
2750	
2751	SHALLOW	Go to; I have spoke at a word. God keep you.
2752	
2753	FALSTAFF	Fare you well, gentle gentlemen.
2754	
2755	[Exeunt Justices]
2756	
2757	On, Bardolph; lead the men away.
2758	
2759	[Exeunt BARDOLPH, Recruits, &c]
2760	
2761	As I return, I will fetch off these justices: I do
2762	see the bottom of Justice Shallow. Lord, Lord, how
2763	subject we old men are to this vice of lying! This
2764	same starved justice hath done nothing but prate to
2765	me of the wildness of his youth, and the feats he
2766	hath done about Turnbull Street: and every third
2767	word a lie, duer paid to the hearer than the Turk's
2768	tribute. I do remember him at Clement's Inn like a
2769	man made after supper of a cheese-paring: when a'
2770	was naked, he was, for all the world, like a forked
2771	radish, with a head fantastically carved upon it
2772	with a knife: a' was so forlorn, that his
2773	dimensions to any thick sight were invincible: a'
2774	was the very genius of famine; yet lecherous as a
2775	monkey, and the whores called him mandrake: a' came
2776	ever in the rearward of the fashion, and sung those
2777	tunes to the overscutched huswives that he heard the
2778	carmen whistle, and swear they were his fancies or
2779	his good-nights. And now is this Vice's dagger
2780	become a squire, and talks as familiarly of John a
2781	Gaunt as if he had been sworn brother to him; and
2782	I'll be sworn a' ne'er saw him but once in the
2783	Tilt-yard; and then he burst his head for crowding
2784	among the marshal's men. I saw it, and told John a
2785	Gaunt he beat his own name; for you might have
2786	thrust him and all his apparel into an eel-skin; the
2787	case of a treble hautboy was a mansion for him, a
2788	court: and now has he land and beefs. Well, I'll
2789	be acquainted with him, if I return; and it shall
2790	go hard but I will make him a philosopher's two
2791	stones to me: if the young dace be a bait for the
2792	old pike, I see no reason in the law of nature but I
2793	may snap at him. Let time shape, and there an end.

2801	
2802	
2803	ACT IV
2804	
2805	
2806	
2807	SCENE I	Yorkshire. Gaultree Forest.
2808	
2809	
2810	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, MOWBRAY, LORD
2811	HASTINGS, and others]
2812	
2813	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	What is this forest call'd?
2814	
2815	HASTINGS	'Tis Gaultree Forest, an't shall please your grace.
2816	
2817	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Here stand, my lords; and send discoverers forth
2818	To know the numbers of our enemies.
2819	
2820	HASTINGS	We have sent forth already.
2821	
2822	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	'Tis well done.
2823	My friends and brethren in these great affairs,
2824	I must acquaint you that I have received
2825	New-dated letters from Northumberland;
2826	Their cold intent, tenor and substance, thus:
2827	Here doth he wish his person, with such powers
2828	As might hold sortance with his quality,
2829	The which he could not levy; whereupon
2830	He is retired, to ripe his growing fortunes,
2831	To Scotland: and concludes in hearty prayers
2832	That your attempts may overlive the hazard
2833	And fearful melting of their opposite.
2834	
2835	MOWBRAY	Thus do the hopes we have in him touch ground
2836	And dash themselves to pieces.
2837	
2838	[Enter a Messenger]
2839	
2840	HASTINGS	Now, what news?
2841	
2842	Messenger	West of this forest, scarcely off a mile,
2843	In goodly form comes on the enemy;
2844	And, by the ground they hide, I judge their number
2845	Upon or near the rate of thirty thousand.
2846	
2847	MOWBRAY	The just proportion that we gave them out
2848	Let us sway on and face them in the field.
2849	
2850	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	What well-appointed leader fronts us here?
2851	
2852	[Enter WESTMORELAND]
2853	
2854	MOWBRAY	I think it is my Lord of Westmoreland.
2855	
2856	WESTMORELAND	Health and fair greeting from our general,
2857	The prince, Lord John and Duke of Lancaster.
2858	
2859	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Say on, my Lord of Westmoreland, in peace:
2860	What doth concern your coming?
2861	
2862	WESTMORELAND	Then, my lord,
2863	Unto your grace do I in chief address
2864	The substance of my speech. If that rebellion
2865	Came like itself, in base and abject routs,
2866	Led on by bloody youth, guarded with rags,
2867	And countenanced by boys and beggary,
2868	I say, if damn'd commotion so appear'd,
2869	In his true, native and most proper shape,
2870	You, reverend father, and these noble lords
2871	Had not been here, to dress the ugly form
2872	Of base and bloody insurrection
2873	With your fair honours. You, lord archbishop,
2874	Whose see is by a civil peace maintained,
2875	Whose beard the silver hand of peace hath touch'd,
2876	Whose learning and good letters peace hath tutor'd,
2877	Whose white investments figure innocence,
2878	The dove and very blessed spirit of peace,
2879	Wherefore do you so ill translate ourself
2880	Out of the speech of peace that bears such grace,
2881	Into the harsh and boisterous tongue of war;
2882	Turning your books to graves, your ink to blood,
2883	Your pens to lances and your tongue divine
2884	To a trumpet and a point of war?
2885	
2886	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Wherefore do I this? so the question stands.
2887	Briefly to this end: we are all diseased,
2888	And with our surfeiting and wanton hours
2889	Have brought ourselves into a burning fever,
2890	And we must bleed for it; of which disease
2891	Our late king, Richard, being infected, died.
2892	But, my most noble Lord of Westmoreland,
2893	I take not on me here as a physician,
2894	Nor do I as an enemy to peace
2895	Troop in the throngs of military men;
2896	But rather show awhile like fearful war,
2897	To diet rank minds sick of happiness
2898	And purge the obstructions which begin to stop
2899	Our very veins of life. Hear me more plainly.
2900	I have in equal balance justly weigh'd
2901	What wrongs our arms may do, what wrongs we suffer,
2902	And find our griefs heavier than our offences.
2903	We see which way the stream of time doth run,
2904	And are enforced from our most quiet there
2905	By the rough torrent of occasion;
2906	And have the summary of all our griefs,
2907	When time shall serve, to show in articles;
2908	Which long ere this we offer'd to the king,
2909	And might by no suit gain our audience:
2910	When we are wrong'd and would unfold our griefs,
2911	We are denied access unto his person
2912	Even by those men that most have done us wrong.
2913	The dangers of the days but newly gone,
2914	Whose memory is written on the earth
2915	With yet appearing blood, and the examples
2916	Of every minute's instance, present now,
2917	Hath put us in these ill-beseeming arms,
2918	Not to break peace or any branch of it,
2919	But to establish here a peace indeed,
2920	Concurring both in name and quality.
2921	
2922	WESTMORELAND	When ever yet was your appeal denied?
2923	Wherein have you been galled by the king?
2924	What peer hath been suborn'd to grate on you,
2925	That you should seal this lawless bloody book
2926	Of forged rebellion with a seal divine
2927	And consecrate commotion's bitter edge?
2928	
2929	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	My brother general, the commonwealth,
2930	To brother born an household cruelty,
2931	I make my quarrel in particular.
2932	
2933	WESTMORELAND	There is no need of any such redress;
2934	Or if there were, it not belongs to you.
2935	
2936	MOWBRAY	Why not to him in part, and to us all
2937	That feel the bruises of the days before,
2938	And suffer the condition of these times
2939	To lay a heavy and unequal hand
2940	Upon our honours?
2941	
2942	WESTMORELAND	                  O, my good Lord Mowbray,
2943	Construe the times to their necessities,
2944	And you shall say indeed, it is the time,
2945	And not the king, that doth you injuries.
2946	Yet for your part, it not appears to me
2947	Either from the king or in the present time
2948	That you should have an inch of any ground
2949	To build a grief on: were you not restored
2950	To all the Duke of Norfolk's signories,
2951	Your noble and right well remember'd father's?
2952	
2953	MOWBRAY	What thing, in honour, had my father lost,
2954	That need to be revived and breathed in me?
2955	The king that loved him, as the state stood then,
2956	Was force perforce compell'd to banish him:
2957	And then that Harry Bolingbroke and he,
2958	Being mounted and both roused in their seats,
2959	Their neighing coursers daring of the spur,
2960	Their armed staves in charge, their beavers down,
2961	Their eyes of fire sparking through sights of steel
2962	And the loud trumpet blowing them together,
2963	Then, then, when there was nothing could have stay'd
2964	My father from the breast of Bolingbroke,
2965	O when the king did throw his warder down,
2966	His own life hung upon the staff he threw;
2967	Then threw he down himself and all their lives
2968	That by indictment and by dint of sword
2969	Have since miscarried under Bolingbroke.
2970	
2971	WESTMORELAND	You speak, Lord Mowbray, now you know not what.
2972	The Earl of Hereford was reputed then
2973	In England the most valiant gentlemen:
2974	Who knows on whom fortune would then have smiled?
2975	But if your father had been victor there,
2976	He ne'er had borne it out of Coventry:
2977	For all the country in a general voice
2978	Cried hate upon him; and all their prayers and love
2979	Were set on Hereford, whom they doted on
2980	And bless'd and graced indeed, more than the king.
2981	But this is mere digression from my purpose.
2982	Here come I from our princely general
2983	To know your griefs; to tell you from his grace
2984	That he will give you audience; and wherein
2985	It shall appear that your demands are just,
2986	You shall enjoy them, every thing set off
2987	That might so much as think you enemies.
2988	
2989	MOWBRAY	But he hath forced us to compel this offer;
2990	And it proceeds from policy, not love.
2991	
2992	WESTMORELAND	Mowbray, you overween to take it so;
2993	This offer comes from mercy, not from fear:
2994	For, lo! within a ken our army lies,
2995	Upon mine honour, all too confident
2996	To give admittance to a thought of fear.
2997	Our battle is more full of names than yours,
2998	Our men more perfect in the use of arms,
2999	Our armour all as strong, our cause the best;
3000	Then reason will our heart should be as good
3001	Say you not then our offer is compell'd.
3002	
3003	MOWBRAY	Well, by my will we shall admit no parley.
3004	
3005	WESTMORELAND	That argues but the shame of your offence:
3006	A rotten case abides no handling.
3007	
3008	HASTINGS	Hath the Prince John a full commission,
3009	In very ample virtue of his father,
3010	To hear and absolutely to determine
3011	Of what conditions we shall stand upon?
3012	
3013	WESTMORELAND	That is intended in the general's name:
3014	I muse you make so slight a question.
3015	
3016	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Then take, my Lord of Westmoreland, this schedule,
3017	For this contains our general grievances:
3018	Each several article herein redress'd,
3019	All members of our cause, both here and hence,
3020	That are insinew'd to this action,
3021	Acquitted by a true substantial form
3022	And present execution of our wills
3023	To us and to our purposes confined,
3024	We come within our awful banks again
3025	And knit our powers to the arm of peace.
3026	
3027	WESTMORELAND	This will I show the general. Please you, lords,
3028	In sight of both our battles we may meet;
3029	And either end in peace, which God so frame!
3030	Or to the place of difference call the swords
3031	Which must decide it.
3032	
3033	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	My lord, we will do so.
3034	
3035	[Exit WESTMORELAND]
3036	
3037	MOWBRAY	There is a thing within my bosom tells me
3038	That no conditions of our peace can stand.
3039	
3040	HASTINGS	Fear you not that: if we can make our peace
3041	Upon such large terms and so absolute
3042	As our conditions shall consist upon,
3043	Our peace shall stand as firm as rocky mountains.
3044	
3045	MOWBRAY	Yea, but our valuation shall be such
3046	That every slight and false-derived cause,
3047	Yea, every idle, nice and wanton reason
3048	Shall to the king taste of this action;
3049	That, were our royal faiths martyrs in love,
3050	We shall be winnow'd with so rough a wind
3051	That even our corn shall seem as light as chaff
3052	And good from bad find no partition.
3053	
3054	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	No, no, my lord. Note this; the king is weary
3055	Of dainty and such picking grievances:
3056	For he hath found to end one doubt by death
3057	Revives two greater in the heirs of life,
3058	And therefore will he wipe his tables clean
3059	And keep no tell-tale to his memory
3060	That may repeat and history his loss
3061	To new remembrance; for full well he knows
3062	He cannot so precisely weed this land
3063	As his misdoubts present occasion:
3064	His foes are so enrooted with his friends
3065	That, plucking to unfix an enemy,
3066	He doth unfasten so and shake a friend:
3067	So that this land, like an offensive wife
3068	That hath enraged him on to offer strokes,
3069	As he is striking, holds his infant up
3070	And hangs resolved correction in the arm
3071	That was uprear'd to execution.
3072	
3073	HASTINGS	Besides, the king hath wasted all his rods
3074	On late offenders, that he now doth lack
3075	The very instruments of chastisement:
3076	So that his power, like to a fangless lion,
3077	May offer, but not hold.
3078	
3079	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	'Tis very true:
3080	And therefore be assured, my good lord marshal,
3081	If we do now make our atonement well,
3082	Our peace will, like a broken limb united,
3083	Grow stronger for the breaking.
3084	
3085	MOWBRAY	Be it so.
3086	Here is return'd my Lord of Westmoreland.
3087

3090	WESTMORELAND	The prince is here at hand: pleaseth your lordship
3091	To meet his grace just distance 'tween our armies.
3092	
3093	MOWBRAY	Your grace of York, in God's name then, set forward.
3094	
3095	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Before, and greet his grace: my lord, we come.

3104	
3105	ACT IV
3106	
3107	
3108	
3109	SCENE II	Another part of the forest.
3110	
3111	
3112	[Enter, from one side, MOWBRAY, attended; afterwards
3113	the ARCHBISHOP OF YORK, HASTINGS, and others: from
3114	the other side, Prince John of LANCASTER, and
3115	WESTMORELAND; Officers, and others with them]
3116	
3117	LANCASTER	You are well encounter'd here, my cousin Mowbray:
3118	Good day to you, gentle lord archbishop;
3119	And so to you, Lord Hastings, and to all.
3120	My Lord of York, it better show'd with you
3121	When that your flock, assembled by the bell,
3122	Encircled you to hear with reverence
3123	Your exposition on the holy text
3124	Than now to see you here an iron man,
3125	Cheering a rout of rebels with your drum,
3126	Turning the word to sword and life to death.
3127	That man that sits within a monarch's heart,
3128	And ripens in the sunshine of his favour,
3129	Would he abuse the countenance of the king,
3130	Alack, what mischiefs might he set abrooch
3131	In shadow of such greatness! With you, lord bishop,
3132	It is even so. Who hath not heard it spoken
3133	How deep you were within the books of God?
3134	To us the speaker in his parliament;
3135	To us the imagined voice of God himself;
3136	The very opener and intelligencer
3137	Between the grace, the sanctities of heaven
3138	And our dull workings. O, who shall believe
3139	But you misuse the reverence of your place,
3140	Employ the countenance and grace of heaven,
3141	As a false favourite doth his prince's name,
3142	In deeds dishonourable? You have ta'en up,
3143	Under the counterfeited zeal of God,
3144	The subjects of his substitute, my father,
3145	And both against the peace of heaven and him
3146	Have here up-swarm'd them.
3147	
3148	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Good my Lord of Lancaster,
3149	I am not here against your father's peace;
3150	But, as I told my lord of Westmoreland,
3151	The time misorder'd doth, in common sense,
3152	Crowd us and crush us to this monstrous form,
3153	To hold our safety up. I sent your grace
3154	The parcels and particulars of our grief,
3155	The which hath been with scorn shoved from the court,
3156	Whereon this Hydra son of war is born;
3157	Whose dangerous eyes may well be charm'd asleep
3158	With grant of our most just and right desires,
3159	And true obedience, of this madness cured,
3160	Stoop tamely to the foot of majesty.
3161	
3162	MOWBRAY	If not, we ready are to try our fortunes
3163	To the last man.
3164	
3165	HASTINGS	                  And though we here fall down,
3166	We have supplies to second our attempt:
3167	If they miscarry, theirs shall second them;
3168	And so success of mischief shall be born
3169	And heir from heir shall hold this quarrel up
3170	Whiles England shall have generation.
3171	
3172	LANCASTER	You are too shallow, Hastings, much too shallow,
3173	To sound the bottom of the after-times.
3174	
3175	WESTMORELAND	Pleaseth your grace to answer them directly
3176	How far forth you do like their articles.
3177	
3178	LANCASTER	I like them all, and do allow them well,
3179	And swear here, by the honour of my blood,
3180	My father's purposes have been mistook,
3181	And some about him have too lavishly
3182	Wrested his meaning and authority.
3183	My lord, these griefs shall be with speed redress'd;
3184	Upon my soul, they shall. If this may please you,
3185	Discharge your powers unto their several counties,
3186	As we will ours: and here between the armies
3187	Let's drink together friendly and embrace,
3188	That all their eyes may bear those tokens home
3189	Of our restored love and amity.
3190	
3191	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I take your princely word for these redresses.
3192	
3193	LANCASTER	I give it you, and will maintain my word:
3194	And thereupon I drink unto your grace.
3195	
3196	HASTINGS	Go, captain, and deliver to the army
3197	This news of peace: let them have pay, and part:
3198	I know it will well please them. Hie thee, captain.
3199	
3200	[Exit Officer]
3201	
3202	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	To you, my noble Lord of Westmoreland.
3203	
3204	WESTMORELAND	I pledge your grace; and, if you knew what pains
3205	I have bestow'd to breed this present peace,
3206	You would drink freely: but my love to ye
3207	Shall show itself more openly hereafter.
3208	
3209	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	I do not doubt you.
3210	
3211	WESTMORELAND	I am glad of it.
3212	Health to my lord and gentle cousin, Mowbray.
3213	
3214	MOWBRAY	You wish me health in very happy season;
3215	For I am, on the sudden, something ill.
3216	
3217	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Against ill chances men are ever merry;
3218	But heaviness foreruns the good event.
3219	
3220	WESTMORELAND	Therefore be merry, coz; since sudden sorrow
3221	Serves to say thus, 'some good thing comes
3222	to-morrow.'
3223	
3224	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Believe me, I am passing light in spirit.
3225	
3226	MOWBRAY	So much the worse, if your own rule be true.
3227	
3228	[Shouts within]
3229	
3230	LANCASTER	The word of peace is render'd: hark, how they shout!
3231	
3232	MOWBRAY	This had been cheerful after victory.
3233	
3234	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	A peace is of the nature of a conquest;
3235	For then both parties nobly are subdued,
3236	And neither party loser.
3237	
3238	LANCASTER	Go, my lord,
3239	And let our army be discharged too.
3240	
3241	[Exit WESTMORELAND]
3242	
3243	And, good my lord, so please you, let our trains
3244	March, by us, that we may peruse the men
3245	We should have coped withal.
3246	
3247	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Go, good Lord Hastings,
3248	And, ere they be dismissed, let them march by.
3249	
3250	[Exit HASTINGS]
3251	
3252	LANCASTER	I trust, lords, we shall lie to-night together.
3253	
3254	[Re-enter WESTMORELAND]
3255	
3256	Now, cousin, wherefore stands our army still?
3257	
3258	WESTMORELAND	The leaders, having charge from you to stand,
3259	Will not go off until they hear you speak.
3260	
3261	LANCASTER	They know their duties.
3262	
3263	[Re-enter HASTINGS]
3264	
3265	HASTINGS	My lord, our army is dispersed already;
3266	Like youthful steers unyoked, they take their courses
3267	East, west, north, south; or, like a school broke up,
3268	Each hurries toward his home and sporting-place.
3269	
3270	WESTMORELAND	Good tidings, my Lord Hastings; for the which
3271	I do arrest thee, traitor, of high treason:
3272	And you, lord archbishop, and you, Lord Mowbray,
3273	Of capitol treason I attach you both.
3274	
3275	MOWBRAY	Is this proceeding just and honourable?
3276	
3277	WESTMORELAND	Is your assembly so?
3278	
3279	ARCHBISHOP OF YORK	Will you thus break your faith?
3280	
3281	LANCASTER	I pawn'd thee none:
3282	I promised you redress of these same grievances
3283	Whereof you did complain; which, by mine honour,
3284	I will perform with a most Christian care.
3285	But for you, rebels, look to taste the due
3286	Meet for rebellion and such acts as yours.
3287	Most shallowly did you these arms commence,
3288	Fondly brought here and foolishly sent hence.
3289	Strike up our drums, pursue the scatter'd stray:
3290	God, and not we, hath safely fought to-day.
3291	Some guard these traitors to the block of death,
3292	Treason's true bed and yielder up of breath.

3300	
3301	
3302	ACT IV
3303	
3304	
3305	
3306	SCENE III	Another part of the forest.
3307	
3308	
3309	[Alarum. Excursions. Enter FALSTAFF and COLEVILE, meeting]
3310	
3311	FALSTAFF	What's your name, sir? of what condition are you,
3312	and of what place, I pray?
3313	
3314	COLEVILE	I am a knight, sir, and my name is Colevile of the dale.
3315	
3316	FALSTAFF	Well, then, Colevile is your name, a knight is your
3317	degree, and your place the dale: Colevile shall be
3318	still your name, a traitor your degree, and the
3319	dungeon your place, a place deep enough; so shall
3320	you be still Colevile of the dale.
3321	
3322	COLEVILE	Are not you Sir John Falstaff?
3323	
3324	FALSTAFF	As good a man as he, sir, whoe'er I am. Do ye
3325	yield, sir? or shall I sweat for you? if I do
3326	sweat, they are the drops of thy lovers, and they
3327	weep for thy death: therefore rouse up fear and
3328	trembling, and do observance to my mercy.
3329	
3330	COLEVILE	I think you are Sir John Falstaff, and in that
3331	thought yield me.
3332	
3333	FALSTAFF	I have a whole school of tongues in this belly of
3334	mine, and not a tongue of them all speaks any other
3335	word but my name. An I had but a belly of any
3336	indifference, I were simply the most active fellow
3337	in Europe: my womb, my womb, my womb, undoes me.
3338	Here comes our general.
3339	
3340	[Enter PRINCE JOHN OF LANCASTER, WESTMORELAND,
3341	BLUNT, and others]
3342	
3343	LANCASTER	The heat is past; follow no further now:
3344	Call in the powers, good cousin Westmoreland.
3345	
3346	[Exit WESTMORELAND]
3347	
3348	Now, Falstaff, where have you been all this while?
3349	When every thing is ended, then you come:
3350	These tardy tricks of yours will, on my life,
3351	One time or other break some gallows' back.
3352	
3353	FALSTAFF	I would be sorry, my lord, but it should be thus: I
3354	never knew yet but rebuke and cheque was the reward
3355	of valour. Do you think me a swallow, an arrow, or a
3356	bullet? have I, in my poor and old motion, the
3357	expedition of thought? I have speeded hither with
3358	the very extremest inch of possibility; I have
3359	foundered nine score and odd posts: and here,
3360	travel-tainted as I am, have in my pure and
3361	immaculate valour, taken Sir John Colevile of the
3362	dale, a most furious knight and valorous enemy.
3363	But what of that? he saw me, and yielded; that I
3364	may justly say, with the hook-nosed fellow of Rome,
3365	'I came, saw, and overcame.'
3366	
3367	LANCASTER	It was more of his courtesy than your deserving.
3368	
3369	FALSTAFF	I know not: here he is, and here I yield him: and
3370	I beseech your grace, let it be booked with the
3371	rest of this day's deeds; or, by the Lord, I will
3372	have it in a particular ballad else, with mine own
3373	picture on the top on't, Colevile kissing my foot:
3374	to the which course if I be enforced, if you do not
3375	all show like gilt twopences to me, and I in the
3376	clear sky of fame o'ershine you as much as the full
3377	moon doth the cinders of the element, which show
3378	like pins' heads to her, believe not the word of
3379	the noble: therefore let me have right, and let
3380	desert mount.
3381	
3382	LANCASTER	Thine's too heavy to mount.
3383	
3384	FALSTAFF	Let it shine, then.
3385	
3386	LANCASTER	Thine's too thick to shine.
3387	
3388	FALSTAFF	Let it do something, my good lord, that may do me
3389	good, and call it what you will.
3390	
3391	LANCASTER	Is thy name Colevile?
3392	
3393	COLEVILE	It is, my lord.
3394	
3395	LANCASTER	A famous rebel art thou, Colevile.
3396	
3397	FALSTAFF	And a famous true subject took him.
3398	
3399	COLEVILE	I am, my lord, but as my betters are
3400	That led me hither: had they been ruled by me,
3401	You should have won them dearer than you have.
3402	
3403	FALSTAFF	I know not how they sold themselves: but thou, like
3404	a kind fellow, gavest thyself away gratis; and I
3405	thank thee for thee.
3406	
3407	[Re-enter WESTMORELAND]
3408	
3409	LANCASTER	Now, have you left pursuit?
3410	
3411	WESTMORELAND	Retreat is made and execution stay'd.
3412	
3413	LANCASTER	Send Colevile with his confederates
3414	To York, to present execution:
3415	Blunt, lead him hence; and see you guard him sure.
3416	
3417	[Exeunt BLUNT and others with COLEVILE]
3418	
3419	And now dispatch we toward the court, my lords:
3420	I hear the king my father is sore sick:
3421	Our news shall go before us to his majesty,
3422	Which, cousin, you shall bear to comfort him,
3423	And we with sober speed will follow you.
3424	
3425	FALSTAFF	My lord, I beseech you, give me leave to go
3426	Through Gloucestershire: and, when you come to court,
3427	Stand my good lord, pray, in your good report.
3428	
3429	LANCASTER	Fare you well, Falstaff: I, in my condition,
3430	Shall better speak of you than you deserve.
3431	
3432	[Exeunt all but Falstaff]
3433	
3434	FALSTAFF	I would you had but the wit: 'twere better than
3435	your dukedom. Good faith, this same young sober-
3436	blooded boy doth not love me; nor a man cannot make
3437	him laugh; but that's no marvel, he drinks no wine.
3438	There's never none of these demure boys come to any
3439	proof; for thin drink doth so over-cool their blood,
3440	and making many fish-meals, that they fall into a
3441	kind of male green-sickness; and then when they
3442	marry, they get wenches: they are generally fools
3443	and cowards; which some of us should be too, but for
3444	inflammation. A good sherris sack hath a two-fold
3445	operation in it. It ascends me into the brain;
3446	dries me there all the foolish and dull and curdy
3447	vapours which environ it; makes it apprehensive,
3448	quick, forgetive, full of nimble fiery and
3449	delectable shapes, which, delivered o'er to the
3450	voice, the tongue, which is the birth, becomes
3451	excellent wit. The second property of your
3452	excellent sherris is, the warming of the blood;
3453	which, before cold and settled, left the liver
3454	white and pale, which is the badge of pusillanimity
3455	and cowardice; but the sherris warms it and makes
3456	it course from the inwards to the parts extreme:
3457	it illumineth the face, which as a beacon gives
3458	warning to all the rest of this little kingdom,
3459	man, to arm; and then the vital commoners and
3460	inland petty spirits muster me all to their captain,
3461	the heart, who, great and puffed up with this
3462	retinue, doth any deed of courage; and this valour
3463	comes of sherris. So that skill in the weapon is
3464	nothing without sack, for that sets it a-work; and
3465	learning a mere hoard of gold kept by a devil, till
3466	sack commences it and sets it in act and use.
3467	Hereof comes it that Prince Harry is valiant; for
3468	the cold blood he did naturally inherit of his
3469	father, he hath, like lean, sterile and bare land,
3470	manured, husbanded and tilled with excellent
3471	endeavour of drinking good and good store of fertile
3472	sherris, that he is become very hot and valiant. If
3473	I had a thousand sons, the first humane principle I
3474	would teach them should be, to forswear thin
3475	potations and to addict themselves to sack.
3476	
3477	[Enter BARDOLPH]
3478	
3479	How now Bardolph?
3480	
3481	BARDOLPH	The army is discharged all and gone.
3482	
3483	FALSTAFF	Let them go. I'll through Gloucestershire; and
3484	there will I visit Master Robert Shallow, esquire:
3485	I have him already tempering between my finger and
3486	my thumb, and shortly will I seal with him. Come away.

3500	SCENE IV	Westminster. The Jerusalem Chamber.
3501	
3502	
3503	[Enter KING HENRY IV, the Princes Thomas of CLARENCE
3504	and Humphrey of GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others]
3505	
3506	KING HENRY IV	Now, lords, if God doth give successful end
3507	To this debate that bleedeth at our doors,
3508	We will our youth lead on to higher fields
3509	And draw no swords but what are sanctified.
3510	Our navy is address'd, our power collected,
3511	Our substitutes in absence well invested,
3512	And every thing lies level to our wish:
3513	Only, we want a little personal strength;
3514	And pause us, till these rebels, now afoot,
3515	Come underneath the yoke of government.
3516	
3517	WARWICK	Both which we doubt not but your majesty
3518	Shall soon enjoy.
3519	
3520	KING HENRY IV	                  Humphrey, my son of Gloucester,
3521	Where is the prince your brother?
3522	
3523	GLOUCESTER	I think he's gone to hunt, my lord, at Windsor.
3524	
3525	KING HENRY IV	And how accompanied?
3526	
3527	GLOUCESTER	I do not know, my lord.
3528	
3529	KING HENRY IV	Is not his brother, Thomas of Clarence, with him?
3530	
3531	GLOUCESTER	No, my good lord; he is in presence here.
3532	
3533	CLARENCE	What would my lord and father?
3534	
3535	KING HENRY IV	Nothing but well to thee, Thomas of Clarence.
3536	How chance thou art not with the prince thy brother?
3537	He loves thee, and thou dost neglect him, Thomas;
3538	Thou hast a better place in his affection
3539	Than all thy brothers: cherish it, my boy,
3540	And noble offices thou mayst effect
3541	Of mediation, after I am dead,
3542	Between his greatness and thy other brethren:
3543	Therefore omit him not; blunt not his love,
3544	Nor lose the good advantage of his grace
3545	By seeming cold or careless of his will;
3546	For he is gracious, if he be observed:
3547	He hath a tear for pity and a hand
3548	Open as day for melting charity:
3549	Yet notwithstanding, being incensed, he's flint,
3550	As humorous as winter and as sudden
3551	As flaws congealed in the spring of day.
3552	His temper, therefore, must be well observed:
3553	Chide him for faults, and do it reverently,
3554	When thou perceive his blood inclined to mirth;
3555	But, being moody, give him line and scope,
3556	Till that his passions, like a whale on ground,
3557	Confound themselves with working. Learn this, Thomas,
3558	And thou shalt prove a shelter to thy friends,
3559	A hoop of gold to bind thy brothers in,
3560	That the united vessel of their blood,
3561	Mingled with venom of suggestion--
3562	As, force perforce, the age will pour it in--
3563	Shall never leak, though it do work as strong
3564	As aconitum or rash gunpowder.
3565	
3566	CLARENCE	I shall observe him with all care and love.
3567	
3568	KING HENRY IV	Why art thou not at Windsor with him, Thomas?
3569	
3570	CLARENCE	He is not there to-day; he dines in London.
3571	
3572	KING HENRY IV	And how accompanied? canst thou tell that?
3573	
3574	CLARENCE	With Poins, and other his continual followers.
3575	
3576	KING HENRY IV	Most subject is the fattest soil to weeds;
3577	And he, the noble image of my youth,
3578	Is overspread with them: therefore my grief
3579	Stretches itself beyond the hour of death:
3580	The blood weeps from my heart when I do shape
3581	In forms imaginary the unguided days
3582	And rotten times that you shall look upon
3583	When I am sleeping with my ancestors.
3584	For when his headstrong riot hath no curb,
3585	When rage and hot blood are his counsellors,
3586	When means and lavish manners meet together,
3587	O, with what wings shall his affections fly
3588	Towards fronting peril and opposed decay!
3589	
3590	WARWICK	My gracious lord, you look beyond him quite:
3591	The prince but studies his companions
3592	Like a strange tongue, wherein, to gain the language,
3593	'Tis needful that the most immodest word
3594	Be look'd upon and learn'd; which once attain'd,
3595	Your highness knows, comes to no further use
3596	But to be known and hated. So, like gross terms,
3597	The prince will in the perfectness of time
3598	Cast off his followers; and their memory
3599	Shall as a pattern or a measure live,
3600	By which his grace must mete the lives of others,
3601	Turning past evils to advantages.
3602	
3603	KING HENRY IV	'Tis seldom when the bee doth leave her comb
3604	In the dead carrion.
3605	
3606	[Enter WESTMORELAND]
3607	
3608	Who's here? Westmoreland?
3609	
3610	WESTMORELAND	Health to my sovereign, and new happiness
3611	Added to that that I am to deliver!
3612	Prince John your son doth kiss your grace's hand:
3613	Mowbray, the Bishop Scroop, Hastings and all
3614	Are brought to the correction of your law;
3615	There is not now a rebel's sword unsheath'd
3616	But peace puts forth her olive every where.
3617	The manner how this action hath been borne
3618	Here at more leisure may your highness read,
3619	With every course in his particular.
3620	
3621	KING HENRY IV	O Westmoreland, thou art a summer bird,
3622	Which ever in the haunch of winter sings
3623	The lifting up of day.
3624	
3625	[Enter HARCOURT]
3626	
3627	Look, here's more news.
3628	
3629	HARCOURT	From enemies heaven keep your majesty;
3630	And, when they stand against you, may they fall
3631	As those that I am come to tell you of!
3632	The Earl Northumberland and the Lord Bardolph,
3633	With a great power of English and of Scots
3634	Are by the sheriff of Yorkshire overthrown:
3635	The manner and true order of the fight
3636	This packet, please it you, contains at large.
3637	
3638	KING HENRY IV	And wherefore should these good news make me sick?
3639	Will fortune never come with both hands full,
3640	But write her fair words still in foulest letters?
3641	She either gives a stomach and no food;
3642	Such are the poor, in health; or else a feast
3643	And takes away the stomach; such are the rich,
3644	That have abundance and enjoy it not.
3645	I should rejoice now at this happy news;
3646	And now my sight fails, and my brain is giddy:
3647	O me! come near me; now I am much ill.
3648	
3649	GLOUCESTER	Comfort, your majesty!
3650	
3651	CLARENCE	O my royal father!
3652	
3653	WESTMORELAND	My sovereign lord, cheer up yourself, look up.
3654	
3655	WARWICK	Be patient, princes; you do know, these fits
3656	Are with his highness very ordinary.
3657	Stand from him. Give him air; he'll straight be well.
3658	
3659	CLARENCE	No, no, he cannot long hold out these pangs:
3660	The incessant care and labour of his mind
3661	Hath wrought the mure that should confine it in
3662	So thin that life looks through and will break out.
3663	
3664	GLOUCESTER	The people fear me; for they do observe
3665	Unfather'd heirs and loathly births of nature:
3666	The seasons change their manners, as the year
3667	Had found some months asleep and leap'd them over.
3668	
3669	CLARENCE	The river hath thrice flow'd, no ebb between;
3670	And the old folk, time's doting chronicles,
3671	Say it did so a little time before
3672	That our great-grandsire, Edward, sick'd and died.
3673	
3674	WARWICK	Speak lower, princes, for the king recovers.
3675	
3676	GLOUCESTER	This apoplexy will certain be his end.
3677	
3678	KING HENRY IV	I pray you, take me up, and bear me hence
3679	Into some other chamber: softly, pray.

3693	
3694	[KING HENRY IV lying on a bed: CLARENCE,
3695	GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, and others in attendance]
3696	
3697	KING HENRY IV	Let there be no noise made, my gentle friends;
3698	Unless some dull and favourable hand
3699	Will whisper music to my weary spirit.
3700	
3701	WARWICK	Call for the music in the other room.
3702	
3703	KING HENRY IV	Set me the crown upon my pillow here.
3704	
3705	CLARENCE	His eye is hollow, and he changes much.
3706	
3707	WARWICK	Less noise, less noise!
3708	
3709	[Enter PRINCE HENRY]
3710	
3711	PRINCE HENRY	Who saw the Duke of Clarence?
3712	
3713	CLARENCE	I am here, brother, full of heaviness.
3714	
3715	PRINCE HENRY	How now! rain within doors, and none abroad!
3716	How doth the king?
3717	
3718	GLOUCESTER	Exceeding ill.
3719	
3720	PRINCE HENRY	                  Heard he the good news yet?
3721	Tell it him.
3722	
3723	GLOUCESTER	He alter'd much upon the hearing it.
3724	
3725	PRINCE HENRY	If he be sick with joy, he'll recover without physic.
3726	
3727	WARWICK	Not so much noise, my lords: sweet prince,
3728	speak low;
3729	The king your father is disposed to sleep.
3730	
3731	CLARENCE	Let us withdraw into the other room.
3732	
3733	WARWICK	Will't please your grace to go along with us?
3734	
3735	PRINCE HENRY	No; I will sit and watch here by the king.
3736	
3737	[Exeunt all but PRINCE HENRY]
3738	
3739	Why doth the crown lie there upon his pillow,
3740	Being so troublesome a bedfellow?
3741	O polish'd perturbation! golden care!
3742	That keep'st the ports of slumber open wide
3743	To many a watchful night! sleep with it now!
3744	Yet not so sound and half so deeply sweet
3745	As he whose brow with homely biggen bound
3746	Snores out the watch of night. O majesty!
3747	When thou dost pinch thy bearer, thou dost sit
3748	Like a rich armour worn in heat of day,
3749	That scalds with safety. By his gates of breath
3750	There lies a downy feather which stirs not:
3751	Did he suspire, that light and weightless down
3752	Perforce must move. My gracious lord! my father!
3753	This sleep is sound indeed, this is a sleep
3754	That from this golden rigol hath divorced
3755	So many English kings. Thy due from me
3756	Is tears and heavy sorrows of the blood,
3757	Which nature, love, and filial tenderness,
3758	Shall, O dear father, pay thee plenteously:
3759	My due from thee is this imperial crown,
3760	Which, as immediate as thy place and blood,
3761	Derives itself to me. Lo, here it sits,
3762	Which God shall guard: and put the world's whole strength
3763	Into one giant arm, it shall not force
3764	This lineal honour from me: this from thee
3765	Will I to mine leave, as 'tis left to me.
3766

3768	
3769	KING HENRY IV	Warwick! Gloucester! Clarence!
3770	
3771	[Re-enter WARWICK, GLOUCESTER, CLARENCE, and the rest]
3772	
3773	CLARENCE	Doth the king call?
3774	
3775	WARWICK	What would your majesty? How fares your grace?
3776	
3777	KING HENRY IV	Why did you leave me here alone, my lords?
3778	
3779	CLARENCE	We left the prince my brother here, my liege,
3780	Who undertook to sit and watch by you.
3781	
3782	KING HENRY IV	The Prince of Wales! Where is he? let me see him:
3783	He is not here.
3784	
3785	WARWICK	This door is open; he is gone this way.
3786	
3787	GLOUCESTER	He came not through the chamber where we stay'd.
3788	
3789	KING HENRY IV	Where is the crown? who took it from my pillow?
3790	
3791	WARWICK	When we withdrew, my liege, we left it here.
3792	
3793	KING HENRY IV	The prince hath ta'en it hence: go, seek him out.
3794	Is he so hasty that he doth suppose
3795	My sleep my death?
3796	Find him, my Lord of Warwick; chide him hither.
3797	
3798	[Exit WARWICK]
3799	
3800	This part of his conjoins with my disease,
3801	And helps to end me. See, sons, what things you are!
3802	How quickly nature falls into revolt
3803	When gold becomes her object!
3804	For this the foolish over-careful fathers
3805	Have broke their sleep with thoughts, their brains with care,
3806	Their bones with industry;
3807	For this they have engrossed and piled up
3808	The canker'd heaps of strange-achieved gold;
3809	For this they have been thoughtful to invest
3810	Their sons with arts and martial exercises:
3811	When, like the bee, culling from every flower
3812	The virtuous sweets,
3813	Our thighs pack'd with wax, our mouths with honey,
3814	We bring it to the hive, and, like the bees,
3815	Are murdered for our pains. This bitter taste
3816	Yield his engrossments to the ending father.
3817	
3818	[Re-enter WARWICK]
3819	
3820	Now, where is he that will not stay so long
3821	Till his friend sickness hath determined me?
3822	
3823	WARWICK	My lord, I found the prince in the next room,
3824	Washing with kindly tears his gentle cheeks,
3825	With such a deep demeanor in great sorrow
3826	That tyranny, which never quaff'd but blood,
3827	Would, by beholding him, have wash'd his knife
3828	With gentle eye-drops. He is coming hither.
3829	
3830	KING HENRY IV	But wherefore did he take away the crown?
3831	
3832	[Re-enter PRINCE HENRY]
3833	
3834	Lo, where he comes. Come hither to me, Harry.
3835	Depart the chamber, leave us here alone.
3836	
3837	[Exeunt WARWICK and the rest]
3838	
3839	PRINCE HENRY	I never thought to hear you speak again.
3840	
3841	KING HENRY IV	Thy wish was father, Harry, to that thought:
3842	I stay too long by thee, I weary thee.
3843	Dost thou so hunger for mine empty chair
3844	That thou wilt needs invest thee with my honours
3845	Before thy hour be ripe? O foolish youth!
3846	Thou seek'st the greatness that will o'erwhelm thee.
3847	Stay but a little; for my cloud of dignity
3848	Is held from falling with so weak a wind
3849	That it will quickly drop: my day is dim.
3850	Thou hast stolen that which after some few hours
3851	Were thine without offence; and at my death
3852	Thou hast seal'd up my expectation:
3853	Thy life did manifest thou lovedst me not,
3854	And thou wilt have me die assured of it.
3855	Thou hidest a thousand daggers in thy thoughts,
3856	Which thou hast whetted on thy stony heart,
3857	To stab at half an hour of my life.
3858	What! canst thou not forbear me half an hour?
3859	Then get thee gone and dig my grave thyself,
3860	And bid the merry bells ring to thine ear
3861	That thou art crowned, not that I am dead.
3862	Let all the tears that should bedew my hearse
3863	Be drops of balm to sanctify thy head:
3864	Only compound me with forgotten dust
3865	Give that which gave thee life unto the worms.
3866	Pluck down my officers, break my decrees;
3867	For now a time is come to mock at form:
3868	Harry the Fifth is crown'd: up, vanity!
3869	Down, royal state! all you sage counsellors, hence!
3870	And to the English court assemble now,
3871	From every region, apes of idleness!
3872	Now, neighbour confines, purge you of your scum:
3873	Have you a ruffian that will swear, drink, dance,
3874	Revel the night, rob, murder, and commit
3875	The oldest sins the newest kind of ways?
3876	Be happy, he will trouble you no more;
3877	England shall double gild his treble guilt,
3878	England shall give him office, honour, might;
3879	For the fifth Harry from curb'd licence plucks
3880	The muzzle of restraint, and the wild dog
3881	Shall flesh his tooth on every innocent.
3882	O my poor kingdom, sick with civil blows!
3883	When that my care could not withhold thy riots,
3884	What wilt thou do when riot is thy care?
3885	O, thou wilt be a wilderness again,
3886	Peopled with wolves, thy old inhabitants!
3887	
3888	PRINCE HENRY	O, pardon me, my liege! but for my tears,
3889	The moist impediments unto my speech,
3890	I had forestall'd this dear and deep rebuke
3891	Ere you with grief had spoke and I had heard
3892	The course of it so far. There is your crown;
3893	And He that wears the crown immortally
3894	Long guard it yours! If I affect it more
3895	Than as your honour and as your renown,
3896	Let me no more from this obedience rise,
3897	Which my most inward true and duteous spirit
3898	Teacheth, this prostrate and exterior bending.
3899	God witness with me, when I here came in,
3900	And found no course of breath within your majesty,
3901	How cold it struck my heart! If I do feign,
3902	O, let me in my present wildness die
3903	And never live to show the incredulous world
3904	The noble change that I have purposed!
3905	Coming to look on you, thinking you dead,
3906	And dead almost, my liege, to think you were,
3907	I spake unto this crown as having sense,
3908	And thus upbraided it: 'The care on thee depending
3909	Hath fed upon the body of my father;
3910	Therefore, thou best of gold art worst of gold:
3911	Other, less fine in carat, is more precious,
3912	Preserving life in medicine potable;
3913	But thou, most fine, most honour'd: most renown'd,
3914	Hast eat thy bearer up.' Thus, my most royal liege,
3915	Accusing it, I put it on my head,
3916	To try with it, as with an enemy
3917	That had before my face murder'd my father,
3918	The quarrel of a true inheritor.
3919	But if it did infect my blood with joy,
3920	Or swell my thoughts to any strain of pride;
3921	If any rebel or vain spirit of mine
3922	Did with the least affection of a welcome
3923	Give entertainment to the might of it,
3924	Let God for ever keep it from my head
3925	And make me as the poorest vassal is
3926	That doth with awe and terror kneel to it!
3927	
3928	KING HENRY IV	O my son,
3929	God put it in thy mind to take it hence,
3930	That thou mightst win the more thy father's love,
3931	Pleading so wisely in excuse of it!
3932	Come hither, Harry, sit thou by my bed;
3933	And hear, I think, the very latest counsel
3934	That ever I shall breathe. God knows, my son,
3935	By what by-paths and indirect crook'd ways
3936	I met this crown; and I myself know well
3937	How troublesome it sat upon my head.
3938	To thee it shall descend with bitter quiet,
3939	Better opinion, better confirmation;
3940	For all the soil of the achievement goes
3941	With me into the earth. It seem'd in me
3942	But as an honour snatch'd with boisterous hand,
3943	And I had many living to upbraid
3944	My gain of it by their assistances;
3945	Which daily grew to quarrel and to bloodshed,
3946	Wounding supposed peace: all these bold fears
3947	Thou see'st with peril I have answered;
3948	For all my reign hath been but as a scene
3949	Acting that argument: and now my death
3950	Changes the mode; for what in me was purchased,
3951	Falls upon thee in a more fairer sort;
3952	So thou the garland wear'st successively.
3953	Yet, though thou stand'st more sure than I could do,
3954	Thou art not firm enough, since griefs are green;
3955	And all my friends, which thou must make thy friends,
3956	Have but their stings and teeth newly ta'en out;
3957	By whose fell working I was first advanced
3958	And by whose power I well might lodge a fear
3959	To be again displaced: which to avoid,
3960	I cut them off; and had a purpose now
3961	To lead out many to the Holy Land,
3962	Lest rest and lying still might make them look
3963	Too near unto my state. Therefore, my Harry,
3964	Be it thy course to busy giddy minds
3965	With foreign quarrels; that action, hence borne out,
3966	May waste the memory of the former days.
3967	More would I, but my lungs are wasted so
3968	That strength of speech is utterly denied me.
3969	How I came by the crown, O God forgive;
3970	And grant it may with thee in true peace live!
3971	
3972	PRINCE HENRY	My gracious liege,
3973	You won it, wore it, kept it, gave it me;
3974	Then plain and right must my possession be:
3975	Which I with more than with a common pain
3976	'Gainst all the world will rightfully maintain.
3977	
3978	[Enter Lord John of LANCASTER]
3979	
3980	KING HENRY IV	Look, look, here comes my John of Lancaster.
3981	
3982	LANCASTER	Health, peace, and happiness to my royal father!
3983	
3984	KING HENRY IV	Thou bring'st me happiness and peace, son John;
3985	But health, alack, with youthful wings is flown
3986	From this bare wither'd trunk: upon thy sight
3987	My worldly business makes a period.
3988	Where is my Lord of Warwick?
3989	
3990	PRINCE HENRY	My Lord of Warwick!
3991	
3992	[Enter WARWICK, and others]
3993	
3994	KING HENRY IV	Doth any name particular belong
3995	Unto the lodging where I first did swoon?
3996	
3997	WARWICK	'Tis call'd Jerusalem, my noble lord.
3998	
3999	KING HENRY IV	Laud be to God! even there my life must end.
4000	It hath been prophesied to me many years,
4001	I should not die but in Jerusalem;
4002	Which vainly I supposed the Holy Land:
4003	But bear me to that chamber; there I'll lie;
4004	In that Jerusalem shall Harry die.

4019	
4020	
4021	[Enter SHALLOW, FALSTAFF, BARDOLPH, and Page]
4022	
4023	SHALLOW	By cock and pie, sir, you shall not away to-night.
4024	What, Davy, I say!
4025	
4026	FALSTAFF	You must excuse me, Master Robert Shallow.
4027	
4028	SHALLOW	I will not excuse you; you shall not be excused;
4029	excuses shall not be admitted; there is no excuse
4030	shall serve; you shall not be excused. Why, Davy!
4031	
4032	[Enter DAVY]
4033	
4034	DAVY	Here, sir.
4035	
4036	SHALLOW	Davy, Davy, Davy, Davy, let me see, Davy; let me
4037	see, Davy; let me see: yea, marry, William cook,
4038	bid him come hither. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
4039	
4040	DAVY	Marry, sir, thus; those precepts cannot be served:
4041	and, again, sir, shall we sow the headland with wheat?
4042	
4043	SHALLOW	With red wheat, Davy. But for William cook: are
4044	there no young pigeons?
4045	
4046	DAVY	Yes, sir. Here is now the smith's note for shoeing
4047	and plough-irons.
4048	
4049	SHALLOW	Let it be cast and paid. Sir John, you shall not be excused.
4050	
4051	DAVY	Now, sir, a new link to the bucket must need be
4052	had: and, sir, do you mean to stop any of William's
4053	wages, about the sack he lost the other day at
4054	Hinckley fair?
4055	
4056	SHALLOW	A' shall answer it. Some pigeons, Davy, a couple
4057	of short-legged hens, a joint of mutton, and any
4058	pretty little tiny kickshaws, tell William cook.
4059	
4060	DAVY	Doth the man of war stay all night, sir?
4061	
4062	SHALLOW	Yea, Davy. I will use him well: a friend i' the
4063	court is better than a penny in purse. Use his men
4064	well, Davy; for they are arrant knaves, and will backbite.
4065	
4066	DAVY	No worse than they are backbitten, sir; for they
4067	have marvellous foul linen.
4068	
4069	SHALLOW	Well conceited, Davy: about thy business, Davy.
4070	
4071	DAVY	I beseech you, sir, to countenance William Visor of
4072	Woncot against Clement Perkes of the hill.
4073	
4074	SHALLOW	There is many complaints, Davy, against that Visor:
4075	that Visor is an arrant knave, on my knowledge.
4076	
4077	DAVY	I grant your worship that he is a knave, sir; but
4078	yet, God forbid, sir, but a knave should have some
4079	countenance at his friend's request. An honest
4080	man, sir, is able to speak for himself, when a knave
4081	is not. I have served your worship truly, sir,
4082	this eight years; and if I cannot once or twice in
4083	a quarter bear out a knave against an honest man, I
4084	have but a very little credit with your worship. The
4085	knave is mine honest friend, sir; therefore, I
4086	beseech your worship, let him be countenanced.
4087	
4088	SHALLOW	Go to; I say he shall have no wrong. Look about, Davy.
4089	
4090	[Exit DAVY]
4091	
4092	Where are you, Sir John? Come, come, come, off
4093	with your boots. Give me your hand, Master Bardolph.
4094	
4095	BARDOLPH	I am glad to see your worship.
4096	
4097	SHALLOW	I thank thee with all my heart, kind
4098	Master Bardolph: and welcome, my tall fellow.
4099	
4100	[To the Page]
4101	
4102	Come, Sir John.

4109	
4110	[Exeunt BARDOLPH and Page]
4111	
4112	If I were sawed into quantities, I should make four
4113	dozen of such bearded hermits' staves as Master
4114	Shallow. It is a wonderful thing to see the
4115	semblable coherence of his men's spirits and his:
4116	they, by observing of him, do bear themselves like
4117	foolish justices; he, by conversing with them, is
4118	turned into a justice-like serving-man: their
4119	spirits are so married in conjunction with the
4120	participation of society that they flock together in
4121	consent, like so many wild-geese. If I had a suit
4122	to Master Shallow, I would humour his men with the
4123	imputation of being near their master: if to his
4124	men, I would curry with Master Shallow that no man
4125	could better command his servants. It is certain
4126	that either wise bearing or ignorant carriage is
4127	caught, as men take diseases, one of another:
4128	therefore let men take heed of their company. I
4129	will devise matter enough out of this Shallow to
4130	keep Prince Harry in continual laughter the wearing
4131	out of six fashions, which is four terms, or two
4132	actions, and a' shall laugh without intervallums. O,
4133	it is much that a lie with a slight oath and a jest
4134	with a sad brow will do with a fellow that never
4135	had the ache in his shoulders! O, you shall see him
4136	laugh till his face be like a wet cloak ill laid up!
4137	
4138	SHALLOW	[Within]  Sir John!
4139	
4140	FALSTAFF	I come, Master Shallow; I come, Master Shallow.

4154	SCENE II	Westminster. The palace.
4155	
4156	
4157	[Enter WARWICK and the Lord Chief-Justice, meeting]
4158	
4159	WARWICK	How now, my lord chief-justice! whither away?
4160	
4161	Lord Chief-Justice	How doth the king?
4162	
4163	WARWICK	Exceeding well; his cares are now all ended.
4164	
4165	Lord Chief-Justice	I hope, not dead.
4166	
4167	WARWICK	He's walk'd the way of nature;
4168	And to our purposes he lives no more.
4169	
4170	Lord Chief-Justice	I would his majesty had call'd me with him:
4171	The service that I truly did his life
4172	Hath left me open to all injuries.
4173	
4174	WARWICK	Indeed I think the young king loves you not.
4175	
4176	Lord Chief-Justice	I know he doth not, and do arm myself
4177	To welcome the condition of the time,
4178	Which cannot look more hideously upon me
4179	Than I have drawn it in my fantasy.
4180	
4181	[Enter LANCASTER, CLARENCE, GLOUCESTER,
4182	WESTMORELAND, and others]
4183	
4184	WARWICK	Here come the heavy issue of dead Harry:
4185	O that the living Harry had the temper
4186	Of him, the worst of these three gentlemen!
4187	How many nobles then should hold their places
4188	That must strike sail to spirits of vile sort!
4189	
4190	Lord Chief-Justice	O God, I fear all will be overturn'd!
4191	
4192	LANCASTER	Good morrow, cousin Warwick, good morrow.
4193	
4194	
4195	GLOUCESTER	|
4196	|  Good morrow, cousin.
4197	CLARENCE	|
4198	
4199	
4200	LANCASTER	We meet like men that had forgot to speak.
4201	
4202	WARWICK	We do remember; but our argument
4203	Is all too heavy to admit much talk.
4204	
4205	LANCASTER	Well, peace be with him that hath made us heavy.
4206	
4207	Lord Chief-Justice	Peace be with us, lest we be heavier!
4208	
4209	GLOUCESTER	O, good my lord, you have lost a friend indeed;
4210	And I dare swear you borrow not that face
4211	Of seeming sorrow, it is sure your own.
4212	
4213	LANCASTER	Though no man be assured what grace to find,
4214	You stand in coldest expectation:
4215	I am the sorrier; would 'twere otherwise.
4216	
4217	CLARENCE	Well, you must now speak Sir John Falstaff fair;
4218	Which swims against your stream of quality.
4219	
4220	Lord Chief-Justice	Sweet princes, what I did, I did in honour,
4221	Led by the impartial conduct of my soul:
4222	And never shall you see that I will beg
4223	A ragged and forestall'd remission.
4224	If truth and upright innocency fail me,
4225	I'll to the king my master that is dead,
4226	And tell him who hath sent me after him.
4227	
4228	WARWICK	Here comes the prince.
4229	
4230	[Enter KING HENRY V, attended]
4231	
4232	Lord Chief-Justice	Good morrow; and God save your majesty!
4233	
4234	KING HENRY V	This new and gorgeous garment, majesty,
4235	Sits not so easy on me as you think.
4236	Brothers, you mix your sadness with some fear:
4237	This is the English, not the Turkish court;
4238	Not Amurath an Amurath succeeds,
4239	But Harry Harry. Yet be sad, good brothers,
4240	For, by my faith, it very well becomes you:
4241	Sorrow so royally in you appears
4242	That I will deeply put the fashion on
4243	And wear it in my heart: why then, be sad;
4244	But entertain no more of it, good brothers,
4245	Than a joint burden laid upon us all.
4246	For me, by heaven, I bid you be assured,
4247	I'll be your father and your brother too;
4248	Let me but bear your love, I 'll bear your cares:
4249	Yet weep that Harry's dead; and so will I;
4250	But Harry lives, that shall convert those tears
4251	By number into hours of happiness.
4252	
4253	Princes	We hope no other from your majesty.
4254	
4255	KING HENRY V	You all look strangely on me: and you most;
4256	You are, I think, assured I love you not.
4257	
4258	Lord Chief-Justice	I am assured, if I be measured rightly,
4259	Your majesty hath no just cause to hate me.
4260	
4261	KING HENRY V	No!
4262	How might a prince of my great hopes forget
4263	So great indignities you laid upon me?
4264	What! rate, rebuke, and roughly send to prison
4265	The immediate heir of England! Was this easy?
4266	May this be wash'd in Lethe, and forgotten?
4267	
4268	Lord Chief-Justice	I then did use the person of your father;
4269	The image of his power lay then in me:
4270	And, in the administration of his law,
4271	Whiles I was busy for the commonwealth,
4272	Your highness pleased to forget my place,
4273	The majesty and power of law and justice,
4274	The image of the king whom I presented,
4275	And struck me in my very seat of judgment;
4276	Whereon, as an offender to your father,
4277	I gave bold way to my authority
4278	And did commit you. If the deed were ill,
4279	Be you contented, wearing now the garland,
4280	To have a son set your decrees at nought,
4281	To pluck down justice from your awful bench,
4282	To trip the course of law and blunt the sword
4283	That guards the peace and safety of your person;
4284	Nay, more, to spurn at your most royal image
4285	And mock your workings in a second body.
4286	Question your royal thoughts, make the case yours;
4287	Be now the father and propose a son,
4288	Hear your own dignity so much profaned,
4289	See your most dreadful laws so loosely slighted,
4290	Behold yourself so by a son disdain'd;
4291	And then imagine me taking your part
4292	And in your power soft silencing your son:
4293	After this cold considerance, sentence me;
4294	And, as you are a king, speak in your state
4295	What I have done that misbecame my place,
4296	My person, or my liege's sovereignty.
4297	
4298	KING HENRY V	You are right, justice, and you weigh this well;
4299	Therefore still bear the balance and the sword:
4300	And I do wish your honours may increase,
4301	Till you do live to see a son of mine
4302	Offend you and obey you, as I did.
4303	So shall I live to speak my father's words:
4304	'Happy am I, that have a man so bold,
4305	That dares do justice on my proper son;
4306	And not less happy, having such a son,
4307	That would deliver up his greatness so
4308	Into the hands of justice.' You did commit me:
4309	For which, I do commit into your hand
4310	The unstained sword that you have used to bear;
4311	With this remembrance, that you use the same
4312	With the like bold, just and impartial spirit
4313	As you have done 'gainst me. There is my hand.
4314	You shall be as a father to my youth:
4315	My voice shall sound as you do prompt mine ear,
4316	And I will stoop and humble my intents
4317	To your well-practised wise directions.
4318	And, princes all, believe me, I beseech you;
4319	My father is gone wild into his grave,
4320	For in his tomb lie my affections;
4321	And with his spirit sadly I survive,
4322	To mock the expectation of the world,
4323	To frustrate prophecies and to raze out
4324	Rotten opinion, who hath writ me down
4325	After my seeming. The tide of blood in me
4326	Hath proudly flow'd in vanity till now:
4327	Now doth it turn and ebb back to the sea,
4328	Where it shall mingle with the state of floods
4329	And flow henceforth in formal majesty.
4330	Now call we our high court of parliament:
4331	And let us choose such limbs of noble counsel,
4332	That the great body of our state may go
4333	In equal rank with the best govern'd nation;
4334	That war, or peace, or both at once, may be
4335	As things acquainted and familiar to us;
4336	In which you, father, shall have foremost hand.
4337	Our coronation done, we will accite,
4338	As I before remember'd, all our state:
4339	And, God consigning to my good intents,
4340	No prince nor peer shall have just cause to say,
4341	God shorten Harry's happy life one day!

4524	And golden times and happy news of price.

4543	
4544	PISTOL	Why then, lament therefore.
4545	
4546	SHALLOW	Give me pardon, sir: if, sir, you come with news
4547	from the court, I take it there's but two ways,
4548	either to utter them, or to conceal them. I am,
4549	sir, under the king, in some authority.
4550	
4551	PISTOL	Under which king, Besonian? speak, or die.
4552	
4553	SHALLOW	Under King Harry.

4558	
4559	PISTOL	A foutre for thine office!
4560	Sir John, thy tender lambkin now is king;
4561	Harry the Fifth's the man. I speak the truth:
4562	When Pistol lies, do this; and fig me, like
4563	The bragging Spaniard.
4564	
4565	FALSTAFF	What, is the old king dead?
4566	
4567	PISTOL	As nail in door: the things I speak are just.
4568	
4569	FALSTAFF	Away, Bardolph! saddle my horse. Master Robert
4570	Shallow, choose what office thou wilt in the land,
4571	'tis thine. Pistol, I will double-charge thee with dignities.
4572	
4573	BARDOLPH	O joyful day!
4574	I would not take a knighthood for my fortune.
4575	
4576	PISTOL	What! I do bring good news.
4577	
4578	FALSTAFF	Carry Master Silence to bed. Master Shallow, my
4579	Lord Shallow,--be what thou wilt; I am fortune's
4580	steward--get on thy boots: we'll ride all night.
4581	O sweet Pistol! Away, Bardolph!
4582	
4583	[Exit BARDOLPH]
4584	
4585	Come, Pistol, utter more to me; and withal devise
4586	something to do thyself good. Boot, boot, Master
4587	Shallow: I know the young king is sick for me. Let
4588	us take any man's horses; the laws of England are at
4589	my commandment. Blessed are they that have been my
4590	friends; and woe to my lord chief-justice!
4591

4640	if you be not swinged, I'll forswear half-kirtles.
4641	
4642	First Beadle	Come, come, you she knight-errant, come.
4643	
4644	MISTRESS QUICKLY	O God, that right should thus overcome might!
4645	Well, of sufferance comes ease.
4646	
4647	DOLL TEARSHEET	Come, you rogue, come; bring me to a justice.
4648	
4649	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Ay, come, you starved blood-hound.
4650	
4651	DOLL TEARSHEET	Goodman death, goodman bones!
4652	
4653	MISTRESS QUICKLY	Thou atomy, thou!
4654	
4655	DOLL TEARSHEET	Come, you thin thing; come you rascal.
4656	
4657	First Beadle	Very well.
4658

4664	2 KING HENRY IV
4665	
4666	
4667	ACT V
4668	
4669	
4670	
4671	SCENE V	A public place near Westminster Abbey.
4672	
4673	
4674	[Enter two Grooms, strewing rushes]
4675	
4676	First Groom	More rushes, more rushes.
4677	
4678	Second Groom	The trumpets have sounded twice.
4679	
4680	First Groom	'Twill be two o'clock ere they come from the
4681	coronation: dispatch, dispatch.
4682	
4683	[Exeunt]
4684	
4685	[Enter FALSTAFF, SHALLOW, PISTOL,
4686	BARDOLPH, and Page]
4687	
4688	FALSTAFF	Stand here by me, Master Robert Shallow; I will
4689	make the king do you grace: I will leer upon him as
4690	a' comes by; and do but mark the countenance that he
4691	will give me.
4692	
4693	PISTOL	God bless thy lungs, good knight.
4694	
4695	FALSTAFF	Come here, Pistol; stand behind me. O, if I had had
4696	time to have made new liveries, I would have
4697	bestowed the thousand pound I borrowed of you. But
4698	'tis no matter; this poor show doth better: this
4699	doth infer the zeal I had to see him.
4700	
4701	SHALLOW	It doth so.
4702	
4703	FALSTAFF	It shows my earnestness of affection,--
4704	
4705	SHALLOW	It doth so.
4706	
4707	FALSTAFF	My devotion,--
4708	
4709	SHALLOW	It doth, it doth, it doth.
4710	
4711	FALSTAFF	As it were, to ride day and night; and not to
4712	deliberate, not to remember, not to have patience
4713	to shift me,--
4714	
4715	SHALLOW	It is best, certain.
4716	
4717	FALSTAFF	But to stand stained with travel, and sweating with
4718	desire to see him; thinking of nothing else,
4719	putting all affairs else in oblivion, as if there
4720	were nothing else to be done but to see him.
4721	
4722	PISTOL	'Tis 'semper idem,' for 'obsque hoc nihil est:'
4723	'tis all in every part.
4724	
4725	SHALLOW	'Tis so, indeed.
4726	
4727	PISTOL	My knight, I will inflame thy noble liver,
4728	And make thee rage.
4729	Thy Doll, and Helen of thy noble thoughts,
4730	Is in base durance and contagious prison;
4731	Haled thither
4732	By most mechanical and dirty hand:
4733	Rouse up revenge from ebon den with fell
4734	Alecto's snake,
4735	For Doll is in. Pistol speaks nought but truth.
4736	
4737	FALSTAFF	I will deliver her.
4738	
4739	[Shouts within, and the trumpets sound]
4740	
4741	PISTOL	There roar'd the sea, and trumpet-clangor sounds.
4742	
4743	[Enter KING HENRY V and his train, the Lord Chief-
4744	Justice among them]
4745	
4746	FALSTAFF	God save thy grace, King Hal! my royal Hal!
4747	
4748	PISTOL	The heavens thee guard and keep, most royal imp of fame!
4749	
4750	FALSTAFF	God save thee, my sweet boy!
4751	
4752	KING HENRY IV	My lord chief-justice, speak to that vain man.
4753	
4754	Lord Chief-Justice	Have you your wits? know you what 'tis to speak?
4755	
4756	FALSTAFF	My king! my Jove! I speak to thee, my heart!
4757	
4758	KING HENRY IV	I know thee not, old man: fall to thy prayers;
4759	How ill white hairs become a fool and jester!
4760	I have long dream'd of such a kind of man,
4761	So surfeit-swell'd, so old and so profane;
4762	But, being awaked, I do despise my dream.
4763	Make less thy body hence, and more thy grace;
4764	Leave gormandizing; know the grave doth gape
4765	For thee thrice wider than for other men.
4766	Reply not to me with a fool-born jest:
4767	Presume not that I am the thing I was;
4768	For God doth know, so shall the world perceive,
4769	That I have turn'd away my former self;
4770	So will I those that kept me company.
4771	When thou dost hear I am as I have been,
4772	Approach me, and thou shalt be as thou wast,
4773	The tutor and the feeder of my riots:
4774	Till then, I banish thee, on pain of death,
4775	As I have done the rest of my misleaders,
4776	Not to come near our person by ten mile.
4777	For competence of life I will allow you,
4778	That lack of means enforce you not to evil:
4779	And, as we hear you do reform yourselves,
4780	We will, according to your strengths and qualities,
4781	Give you advancement. Be it your charge, my lord,
4782	To see perform'd the tenor of our word. Set on.
4783	
4784	[Exeunt KING HENRY V, &c]
4785	
4786	FALSTAFF	Master Shallow, I owe you a thousand pound.
4787	
4788	SHALLOW	Yea, marry, Sir John; which I beseech you to let me
4789	have home with me.
4790	
4791	FALSTAFF	That can hardly be, Master Shallow. Do not you
4792	grieve at this; I shall be sent for in private to
4793	him: look you, he must seem thus to the world:
4794	fear not your advancements; I will be the man yet
4795	that shall make you great.
4796	
4797	SHALLOW	I cannot well perceive how, unless you should give
4798	me your doublet and stuff me out with straw. I
4799	beseech you, good Sir John, let me have five hundred
4800	of my thousand.
4801	
4802	FALSTAFF	Sir, I will be as good as my word: this that you
4803	heard was but a colour.
4804	
4805	SHALLOW	A colour that I fear you will die in, Sir John.
4806	
4807	FALSTAFF	Fear no colours: go with me to dinner: come,
4808	Lieutenant Pistol; come, Bardolph: I shall be sent
4809	for soon at night.
4810	
4811	[Re-enter Prince John of LANCASTER, the Lord
4812	Chief-Justice; Officers with them]
4813	
4814	Lord Chief-Justice	Go, carry Sir John Falstaff to the Fleet:
4815	Take all his company along with him.
4816	
4817	FALSTAFF	My lord, my lord,--
4818	
4819	Lord Chief-Justice	I cannot now speak: I will hear you soon.
4820	Take them away.
4821	
4822	PISTOL	Si fortune me tormenta, spero contenta.
4823	
4824	[Exeunt all but PRINCE JOHN and the Lord
4825	Chief-Justice]
4826	
4827	LANCASTER	I like this fair proceeding of the king's:
4828	He hath intent his wonted followers
4829	Shall all be very well provided for;
4830	But all are banish'd till their conversations
4831	Appear more wise and modest to the world.
4832	
4833	Lord Chief-Justice	And so they are.
4834	
4835	LANCASTER	The king hath call'd his parliament, my lord.
4836	
4837	Lord Chief-Justice	He hath.
4838	
4839	LANCASTER	I will lay odds that, ere this year expire,
4840	We bear our civil swords and native fire
4841	As far as France: I beard a bird so sing,
4842	Whose music, to my thinking, pleased the king.
4843	Come, will you hence?
4844	
4845	[Exeunt]

4850	2 KING HENRY IV
4851	
4852	EPILOGUE
4853	
4854	
4855	[Spoken by a Dancer]
4856	
4857	First my fear; then my courtesy; last my speech.
4858	My fear is, your displeasure; my courtesy, my duty;
4859	and my speech, to beg your pardons. If you look
4860	for a good speech now, you undo me: for what I have
4861	to say is of mine own making; and what indeed I
4862	should say will, I doubt, prove mine own marring.
4863	But to the purpose, and so to the venture. Be it
4864	known to you, as it is very well, I was lately here
4865	in the end of a displeasing play, to pray your
4866	patience for it and to promise you a better. I
4867	meant indeed to pay you with this; which, if like an
4868	ill venture it come unluckily home, I break, and
4869	you, my gentle creditors, lose. Here I promised you
4870	I would be and here I commit my body to your
4871	mercies: bate me some and I will pay you some and,
4872	as most debtors do, promise you infinitely.
4873	
4874	If my tongue cannot entreat you to acquit me, will
4875	you command me to use my legs? and yet that were but
4876	light payment, to dance out of your debt. But a
4877	good conscience will make any possible satisfaction,
4878	and so would I. All the gentlewomen here have
4879	forgiven me: if the gentlemen will not, then the
4880	gentlemen do not agree with the gentlewomen, which
4881	was never seen before in such an assembly.
4882	
4883	One word more, I beseech you. If you be not too
4884	much cloyed with fat meat, our humble author will
4885	continue the story, with Sir John in it, and make
4886	you merry with fair Katharine of France: where, for
4887	any thing I know, Falstaff shall die of a sweat,
4888	unless already a' be killed with your hard
4889	opinions; for Oldcastle died a martyr, and this is
4890	not the man. My tongue is weary; when my legs are
4891	too, I will bid you good night: and so kneel down
4892	before you; but, indeed, to pray for the queen.

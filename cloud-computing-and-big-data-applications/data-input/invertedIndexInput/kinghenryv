110	PROLOGUE
111	
112	
113	[Enter Chorus]
114	
115	Chorus	O for a Muse of fire, that would ascend
116	The brightest heaven of invention,
117	A kingdom for a stage, princes to act
118	And monarchs to behold the swelling scene!
119	Then should the warlike Harry, like himself,
120	Assume the port of Mars; and at his heels,
121	Leash'd in like hounds, should famine, sword and fire
122	Crouch for employment. But pardon, and gentles all,
123	The flat unraised spirits that have dared
124	On this unworthy scaffold to bring forth
125	So great an object: can this cockpit hold
126	The vasty fields of France? or may we cram
127	Within this wooden O the very casques
128	That did affright the air at Agincourt?
129	O, pardon! since a crooked figure may
130	Attest in little place a million;
131	And let us, ciphers to this great accompt,
132	On your imaginary forces work.
133	Suppose within the girdle of these walls
134	Are now confined two mighty monarchies,
135	Whose high upreared and abutting fronts
136	The perilous narrow ocean parts asunder:
137	Piece out our imperfections with your thoughts;
138	Into a thousand parts divide on man,
139	And make imaginary puissance;
140	Think when we talk of horses, that you see them
141	Printing their proud hoofs i' the receiving earth;
142	For 'tis your thoughts that now must deck our kings,
143	Carry them here and there; jumping o'er times,
144	Turning the accomplishment of many years
145	Into an hour-glass: for the which supply,
146	Admit me Chorus to this history;
147	Who prologue-like your humble patience pray,
148	Gently to hear, kindly to judge, our play.

156	
157	
158	ACT I
159	
160	
161	
162	SCENE I	London. An ante-chamber in the KING'S palace.
163	
164	
165	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP OF ELY]
166	
167	CANTERBURY	My lord, I'll tell you; that self bill is urged,
168	Which in the eleventh year of the last king's reign
169	Was like, and had indeed against us pass'd,
170	But that the scambling and unquiet time
171	Did push it out of farther question.
172	
173	ELY	But how, my lord, shall we resist it now?
174	
175	CANTERBURY	It must be thought on. If it pass against us,
176	We lose the better half of our possession:
177	For all the temporal lands which men devout
178	By testament have given to the church
179	Would they strip from us; being valued thus:
180	As much as would maintain, to the king's honour,
181	Full fifteen earls and fifteen hundred knights,
182	Six thousand and two hundred good esquires;
183	And, to relief of lazars and weak age,
184	Of indigent faint souls past corporal toil.
185	A hundred almshouses right well supplied;
186	And to the coffers of the king beside,
187	A thousand pounds by the year: thus runs the bill.
188	
189	ELY	This would drink deep.
190	
191	CANTERBURY	'Twould drink the cup and all.
192	
193	ELY	But what prevention?
194	
195	CANTERBURY	The king is full of grace and fair regard.
196	
197	ELY	And a true lover of the holy church.
198	
199	CANTERBURY	The courses of his youth promised it not.
200	The breath no sooner left his father's body,
201	But that his wildness, mortified in him,
202	Seem'd to die too; yea, at that very moment
203	Consideration, like an angel, came
204	And whipp'd the offending Adam out of him,
205	Leaving his body as a paradise,
206	To envelop and contain celestial spirits.
207	Never was such a sudden scholar made;
208	Never came reformation in a flood,
209	With such a heady currance, scouring faults
210	Nor never Hydra-headed wilfulness
211	So soon did lose his seat and all at once
212	As in this king.
213	
214	ELY	                  We are blessed in the change.
215	
216	CANTERBURY	Hear him but reason in divinity,
217	And all-admiring with an inward wish
218	You would desire the king were made a prelate:
219	Hear him debate of commonwealth affairs,
220	You would say it hath been all in all his study:
221	List his discourse of war, and you shall hear
222	A fearful battle render'd you in music:
223	Turn him to any cause of policy,
224	The Gordian knot of it he will unloose,
225	Familiar as his garter: that, when he speaks,
226	The air, a charter'd libertine, is still,
227	And the mute wonder lurketh in men's ears,
228	To steal his sweet and honey'd sentences;
229	So that the art and practic part of life
230	Must be the mistress to this theoric:
231	Which is a wonder how his grace should glean it,
232	Since his addiction was to courses vain,
233	His companies unletter'd, rude and shallow,
234	His hours fill'd up with riots, banquets, sports,
235	And never noted in him any study,
236	Any retirement, any sequestration
237	From open haunts and popularity.
238	
239	ELY	The strawberry grows underneath the nettle
240	And wholesome berries thrive and ripen best
241	Neighbour'd by fruit of baser quality:
242	And so the prince obscured his contemplation
243	Under the veil of wildness; which, no doubt,
244	Grew like the summer grass, fastest by night,
245	Unseen, yet crescive in his faculty.
246	
247	CANTERBURY	It must be so; for miracles are ceased;
248	And therefore we must needs admit the means
249	How things are perfected.
250	
251	ELY	But, my good lord,
252	How now for mitigation of this bill
253	Urged by the commons? Doth his majesty
254	Incline to it, or no?
255	
256	CANTERBURY	He seems indifferent,
257	Or rather swaying more upon our part
258	Than cherishing the exhibiters against us;
259	For I have made an offer to his majesty,
260	Upon our spiritual convocation
261	And in regard of causes now in hand,
262	Which I have open'd to his grace at large,
263	As touching France, to give a greater sum
264	Than ever at one time the clergy yet
265	Did to his predecessors part withal.
266	
267	ELY	How did this offer seem received, my lord?
268	
269	CANTERBURY	With good acceptance of his majesty;
270	Save that there was not time enough to hear,
271	As I perceived his grace would fain have done,
272	The severals and unhidden passages
273	Of his true titles to some certain dukedoms
274	And generally to the crown and seat of France
275	Derived from Edward, his great-grandfather.
276	
277	ELY	What was the impediment that broke this off?
278	
279	CANTERBURY	The French ambassador upon that instant
280	Craved audience; and the hour, I think, is come
281	To give him hearing: is it four o'clock?
282	
283	ELY	It is.
284	
285	CANTERBURY	Then go we in, to know his embassy;
286	Which I could with a ready guess declare,
287	Before the Frenchman speak a word of it.
288	
289	ELY	I'll wait upon you, and I long to hear it.

299	ACT I
300	
301	
302	
303	SCENE II	The same. The Presence chamber.
304	
305	
306	[Enter KING HENRY V, GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER,
307	WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and Attendants]
308	
309	KING HENRY V	Where is my gracious Lord of Canterbury?
310	
311	EXETER	Not here in presence.
312	
313	KING HENRY V	Send for him, good uncle.
314	
315	WESTMORELAND	Shall we call in the ambassador, my liege?
316	
317	KING HENRY V	Not yet, my cousin: we would be resolved,
318	Before we hear him, of some things of weight
319	That task our thoughts, concerning us and France.
320	
321	[Enter the ARCHBISHOP OF CANTERBURY, and the BISHOP of ELY]
322	
323	CANTERBURY	God and his angels guard your sacred throne
324	And make you long become it!
325	
326	KING HENRY V	Sure, we thank you.
327	My learned lord, we pray you to proceed
328	And justly and religiously unfold
329	Why the law Salique that they have in France
330	Or should, or should not, bar us in our claim:
331	And God forbid, my dear and faithful lord,
332	That you should fashion, wrest, or bow your reading,
333	Or nicely charge your understanding soul
334	With opening titles miscreate, whose right
335	Suits not in native colours with the truth;
336	For God doth know how many now in health
337	Shall drop their blood in approbation
338	Of what your reverence shall incite us to.
339	Therefore take heed how you impawn our person,
340	How you awake our sleeping sword of war:
341	We charge you, in the name of God, take heed;
342	For never two such kingdoms did contend
343	Without much fall of blood; whose guiltless drops
344	Are every one a woe, a sore complaint
345	'Gainst him whose wrong gives edge unto the swords
346	That make such waste in brief mortality.
347	Under this conjuration, speak, my lord;
348	For we will hear, note and believe in heart
349	That what you speak is in your conscience wash'd
350	As pure as sin with baptism.
351	
352	CANTERBURY	Then hear me, gracious sovereign, and you peers,
353	That owe yourselves, your lives and services
354	To this imperial throne. There is no bar
355	To make against your highness' claim to France
356	But this, which they produce from Pharamond,
357	'In terram Salicam mulieres ne succedant:'
358	'No woman shall succeed in Salique land:'
359	Which Salique land the French unjustly gloze
360	To be the realm of France, and Pharamond
361	The founder of this law and female bar.
362	Yet their own authors faithfully affirm
363	That the land Salique is in Germany,
364	Between the floods of Sala and of Elbe;
365	Where Charles the Great, having subdued the Saxons,
366	There left behind and settled certain French;
367	Who, holding in disdain the German women
368	For some dishonest manners of their life,
369	Establish'd then this law; to wit, no female
370	Should be inheritrix in Salique land:
371	Which Salique, as I said, 'twixt Elbe and Sala,
372	Is at this day in Germany call'd Meisen.
373	Then doth it well appear that Salique law
374	Was not devised for the realm of France:
375	Nor did the French possess the Salique land
376	Until four hundred one and twenty years
377	After defunction of King Pharamond,
378	Idly supposed the founder of this law;
379	Who died within the year of our redemption
380	Four hundred twenty-six; and Charles the Great
381	Subdued the Saxons, and did seat the French
382	Beyond the river Sala, in the year
383	Eight hundred five. Besides, their writers say,
384	King Pepin, which deposed Childeric,
385	Did, as heir general, being descended
386	Of Blithild, which was daughter to King Clothair,
387	Make claim and title to the crown of France.
388	Hugh Capet also, who usurped the crown
389	Of Charles the duke of Lorraine, sole heir male
390	Of the true line and stock of Charles the Great,
391	To find his title with some shows of truth,
392	'Through, in pure truth, it was corrupt and naught,
393	Convey'd himself as heir to the Lady Lingare,
394	Daughter to Charlemain, who was the son
395	To Lewis the emperor, and Lewis the son
396	Of Charles the Great. Also King Lewis the Tenth,
397	Who was sole heir to the usurper Capet,
398	Could not keep quiet in his conscience,
399	Wearing the crown of France, till satisfied
400	That fair Queen Isabel, his grandmother,
401	Was lineal of the Lady Ermengare,
402	Daughter to Charles the foresaid duke of Lorraine:
403	By the which marriage the line of Charles the Great
404	Was re-united to the crown of France.
405	So that, as clear as is the summer's sun.
406	King Pepin's title and Hugh Capet's claim,
407	King Lewis his satisfaction, all appear
408	To hold in right and title of the female:
409	So do the kings of France unto this day;
410	Howbeit they would hold up this Salique law
411	To bar your highness claiming from the female,
412	And rather choose to hide them in a net
413	Than amply to imbar their crooked titles
414	Usurp'd from you and your progenitors.
415	
416	KING HENRY V	May I with right and conscience make this claim?
417	
418	CANTERBURY	The sin upon my head, dread sovereign!
419	For in the book of Numbers is it writ,
420	When the man dies, let the inheritance
421	Descend unto the daughter. Gracious lord,
422	Stand for your own; unwind your bloody flag;
423	Look back into your mighty ancestors:
424	Go, my dread lord, to your great-grandsire's tomb,
425	From whom you claim; invoke his warlike spirit,
426	And your great-uncle's, Edward the Black Prince,
427	Who on the French ground play'd a tragedy,
428	Making defeat on the full power of France,
429	Whiles his most mighty father on a hill
430	Stood smiling to behold his lion's whelp
431	Forage in blood of French nobility.
432	O noble English. that could entertain
433	With half their forces the full Pride of France
434	And let another half stand laughing by,
435	All out of work and cold for action!
436	
437	ELY	Awake remembrance of these valiant dead
438	And with your puissant arm renew their feats:
439	You are their heir; you sit upon their throne;
440	The blood and courage that renowned them
441	Runs in your veins; and my thrice-puissant liege
442	Is in the very May-morn of his youth,
443	Ripe for exploits and mighty enterprises.
444	
445	EXETER	Your brother kings and monarchs of the earth
446	Do all expect that you should rouse yourself,
447	As did the former lions of your blood.
448	
449	WESTMORELAND	They know your grace hath cause and means and might;
450	So hath your highness; never king of England
451	Had nobles richer and more loyal subjects,
452	Whose hearts have left their bodies here in England
453	And lie pavilion'd in the fields of France.
454	
455	CANTERBURY	O, let their bodies follow, my dear liege,
456	With blood and sword and fire to win your right;
457	In aid whereof we of the spiritualty
458	Will raise your highness such a mighty sum
459	As never did the clergy at one time
460	Bring in to any of your ancestors.
461	
462	KING HENRY V	We must not only arm to invade the French,
463	But lay down our proportions to defend
464	Against the Scot, who will make road upon us
465	With all advantages.
466	
467	CANTERBURY	They of those marches, gracious sovereign,
468	Shall be a wall sufficient to defend
469	Our inland from the pilfering borderers.
470	
471	KING HENRY V	We do not mean the coursing snatchers only,
472	But fear the main intendment of the Scot,
473	Who hath been still a giddy neighbour to us;
474	For you shall read that my great-grandfather
475	Never went with his forces into France
476	But that the Scot on his unfurnish'd kingdom
477	Came pouring, like the tide into a breach,
478	With ample and brim fulness of his force,
479	Galling the gleaned land with hot assays,
480	Girding with grievous siege castles and towns;
481	That England, being empty of defence,
482	Hath shook and trembled at the ill neighbourhood.
483	
484	CANTERBURY	She hath been then more fear'd than harm'd, my liege;
485	For hear her but exampled by herself:
486	When all her chivalry hath been in France
487	And she a mourning widow of her nobles,
488	She hath herself not only well defended
489	But taken and impounded as a stray
490	The King of Scots; whom she did send to France,
491	To fill King Edward's fame with prisoner kings
492	And make her chronicle as rich with praise
493	As is the ooze and bottom of the sea
494	With sunken wreck and sunless treasuries.
495	
496	WESTMORELAND	But there's a saying very old and true,
497	'If that you will France win,
498	Then with Scotland first begin:'
499	For once the eagle England being in prey,
500	To her unguarded nest the weasel Scot
501	Comes sneaking and so sucks her princely eggs,
502	Playing the mouse in absence of the cat,
503	To tear and havoc more than she can eat.
504	
505	EXETER	It follows then the cat must stay at home:
506	Yet that is but a crush'd necessity,
507	Since we have locks to safeguard necessaries,
508	And pretty traps to catch the petty thieves.
509	While that the armed hand doth fight abroad,
510	The advised head defends itself at home;
511	For government, though high and low and lower,
512	Put into parts, doth keep in one consent,
513	Congreeing in a full and natural close,
514	Like music.
515	
516	CANTERBURY	          Therefore doth heaven divide
517	The state of man in divers functions,
518	Setting endeavour in continual motion;
519	To which is fixed, as an aim or butt,
520	Obedience: for so work the honey-bees,
521	Creatures that by a rule in nature teach
522	The act of order to a peopled kingdom.
523	They have a king and officers of sorts;
524	Where some, like magistrates, correct at home,
525	Others, like merchants, venture trade abroad,
526	Others, like soldiers, armed in their stings,
527	Make boot upon the summer's velvet buds,
528	Which pillage they with merry march bring home
529	To the tent-royal of their emperor;
530	Who, busied in his majesty, surveys
531	The singing masons building roofs of gold,
532	The civil citizens kneading up the honey,
533	The poor mechanic porters crowding in
534	Their heavy burdens at his narrow gate,
535	The sad-eyed justice, with his surly hum,
536	Delivering o'er to executors pale
537	The lazy yawning drone. I this infer,
538	That many things, having full reference
539	To one consent, may work contrariously:
540	As many arrows, loosed several ways,
541	Come to one mark; as many ways meet in one town;
542	As many fresh streams meet in one salt sea;
543	As many lines close in the dial's centre;
544	So may a thousand actions, once afoot.
545	End in one purpose, and be all well borne
546	Without defeat. Therefore to France, my liege.
547	Divide your happy England into four;
548	Whereof take you one quarter into France,
549	And you withal shall make all Gallia shake.
550	If we, with thrice such powers left at home,
551	Cannot defend our own doors from the dog,
552	Let us be worried and our nation lose
553	The name of hardiness and policy.
554	
555	KING HENRY V	Call in the messengers sent from the Dauphin.
556	
557	[Exeunt some Attendants]
558	
559	Now are we well resolved; and, by God's help,
560	And yours, the noble sinews of our power,
561	France being ours, we'll bend it to our awe,
562	Or break it all to pieces: or there we'll sit,
563	Ruling in large and ample empery
564	O'er France and all her almost kingly dukedoms,
565	Or lay these bones in an unworthy urn,
566	Tombless, with no remembrance over them:
567	Either our history shall with full mouth
568	Speak freely of our acts, or else our grave,
569	Like Turkish mute, shall have a tongueless mouth,
570	Not worshipp'd with a waxen epitaph.
571	
572	[Enter Ambassadors of France]
573	
574	Now are we well prepared to know the pleasure
575	Of our fair cousin Dauphin; for we hear
576	Your greeting is from him, not from the king.
577	
578	First Ambassador	May't please your majesty to give us leave
579	Freely to render what we have in charge;
580	Or shall we sparingly show you far off
581	The Dauphin's meaning and our embassy?
582	
583	KING HENRY V	We are no tyrant, but a Christian king;
584	Unto whose grace our passion is as subject
585	As are our wretches fetter'd in our prisons:
586	Therefore with frank and with uncurbed plainness
587	Tell us the Dauphin's mind.
588	
589	First Ambassador	Thus, then, in few.
590	Your highness, lately sending into France,
591	Did claim some certain dukedoms, in the right
592	Of your great predecessor, King Edward the Third.
593	In answer of which claim, the prince our master
594	Says that you savour too much of your youth,
595	And bids you be advised there's nought in France
596	That can be with a nimble galliard won;
597	You cannot revel into dukedoms there.
598	He therefore sends you, meeter for your spirit,
599	This tun of treasure; and, in lieu of this,
600	Desires you let the dukedoms that you claim
601	Hear no more of you. This the Dauphin speaks.
602	
603	KING HENRY V	What treasure, uncle?
604	
605	EXETER	Tennis-balls, my liege.
606	
607	KING HENRY V	We are glad the Dauphin is so pleasant with us;
608	His present and your pains we thank you for:
609	When we have march'd our rackets to these balls,
610	We will, in France, by God's grace, play a set
611	Shall strike his father's crown into the hazard.
612	Tell him he hath made a match with such a wrangler
613	That all the courts of France will be disturb'd
614	With chaces. And we understand him well,
615	How he comes o'er us with our wilder days,
616	Not measuring what use we made of them.
617	We never valued this poor seat of England;
618	And therefore, living hence, did give ourself
619	To barbarous licence; as 'tis ever common
620	That men are merriest when they are from home.
621	But tell the Dauphin I will keep my state,
622	Be like a king and show my sail of greatness
623	When I do rouse me in my throne of France:
624	For that I have laid by my majesty
625	And plodded like a man for working-days,
626	But I will rise there with so full a glory
627	That I will dazzle all the eyes of France,
628	Yea, strike the Dauphin blind to look on us.
629	And tell the pleasant prince this mock of his
630	Hath turn'd his balls to gun-stones; and his soul
631	Shall stand sore charged for the wasteful vengeance
632	That shall fly with them: for many a thousand widows
633	Shall this his mock mock out of their dear husbands;
634	Mock mothers from their sons, mock castles down;
635	And some are yet ungotten and unborn
636	That shall have cause to curse the Dauphin's scorn.
637	But this lies all within the will of God,
638	To whom I do appeal; and in whose name
639	Tell you the Dauphin I am coming on,
640	To venge me as I may and to put forth
641	My rightful hand in a well-hallow'd cause.
642	So get you hence in peace; and tell the Dauphin
643	His jest will savour but of shallow wit,
644	When thousands weep more than did laugh at it.
645	Convey them with safe conduct. Fare you well.
646	
647	[Exeunt Ambassadors]
648	
649	EXETER	This was a merry message.
650	
651	KING HENRY V	We hope to make the sender blush at it.
652	Therefore, my lords, omit no happy hour
653	That may give furtherance to our expedition;
654	For we have now no thought in us but France,
655	Save those to God, that run before our business.
656	Therefore let our proportions for these wars
657	Be soon collected and all things thought upon
658	That may with reasonable swiftness add
659	More feathers to our wings; for, God before,
660	We'll chide this Dauphin at his father's door.
661	Therefore let every man now task his thought,
662	That this fair action may on foot be brought.
663

675	PROLOGUE
676	
677	
678	[Enter Chorus]
679	
680	Chorus	Now all the youth of England are on fire,
681	And silken dalliance in the wardrobe lies:
682	Now thrive the armourers, and honour's thought
683	Reigns solely in the breast of every man:
684	They sell the pasture now to buy the horse,
685	Following the mirror of all Christian kings,
686	With winged heels, as English Mercuries.
687	For now sits Expectation in the air,
688	And hides a sword from hilts unto the point
689	With crowns imperial, crowns and coronets,
690	Promised to Harry and his followers.
691	The French, advised by good intelligence
692	Of this most dreadful preparation,
693	Shake in their fear and with pale policy
694	Seek to divert the English purposes.
695	O England! model to thy inward greatness,
696	Like little body with a mighty heart,
697	What mightst thou do, that honour would thee do,
698	Were all thy children kind and natural!
699	But see thy fault! France hath in thee found out
700	A nest of hollow bosoms, which he fills
701	With treacherous crowns; and three corrupted men,
702	One, Richard Earl of Cambridge, and the second,
703	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham, and the third,
704	Sir Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland,
705	Have, for the gilt of France,--O guilt indeed!
706	Confirm'd conspiracy with fearful France;
707	And by their hands this grace of kings must die,
708	If hell and treason hold their promises,
709	Ere he take ship for France, and in Southampton.
710	Linger your patience on; and we'll digest
711	The abuse of distance; force a play:
712	The sum is paid; the traitors are agreed;
713	The king is set from London; and the scene
714	Is now transported, gentles, to Southampton;
715	There is the playhouse now, there must you sit:
716	And thence to France shall we convey you safe,
717	And bring you back, charming the narrow seas
718	To give you gentle pass; for, if we may,
719	We'll not offend one stomach with our play.
720	But, till the king come forth, and not till then,
721	Unto Southampton do we shift our scene.

734	
735	SCENE I	London. A street.
736	
737	
738	[Enter Corporal NYM and Lieutenant BARDOLPH]
739	
740	BARDOLPH	Well met, Corporal Nym.
741	
742	NYM	Good morrow, Lieutenant Bardolph.
743	
744	BARDOLPH	What, are Ancient Pistol and you friends yet?
745	
746	NYM	For my part, I care not: I say little; but when
747	time shall serve, there shall be smiles; but that
748	shall be as it may. I dare not fight; but I will
749	wink and hold out mine iron: it is a simple one; but
750	what though? it will toast cheese, and it will
751	endure cold as another man's sword will: and
752	there's an end.
753	
754	BARDOLPH	I will bestow a breakfast to make you friends; and
755	we'll be all three sworn brothers to France: let it
756	be so, good Corporal Nym.
757	
758	NYM	Faith, I will live so long as I may, that's the
759	certain of it; and when I cannot live any longer, I
760	will do as I may: that is my rest, that is the
761	rendezvous of it.
762	
763	BARDOLPH	It is certain, corporal, that he is married to Nell
764	Quickly: and certainly she did you wrong; for you
765	were troth-plight to her.
766	
767	NYM	I cannot tell: things must be as they may: men may
768	sleep, and they may have their throats about them at
769	that time; and some say knives have edges. It must
770	be as it may: though patience be a tired mare, yet
771	she will plod. There must be conclusions. Well, I
772	cannot tell.
773	
774	[Enter PISTOL and Hostess]
775	
776	BARDOLPH	Here comes Ancient Pistol and his wife: good
777	corporal, be patient here. How now, mine host Pistol!
778	
779	PISTOL	Base tike, call'st thou me host? Now, by this hand,
780	I swear, I scorn the term; Nor shall my Nell keep lodgers.
781	
782	Hostess	No, by my troth, not long; for we cannot lodge and
783	board a dozen or fourteen gentlewomen that live
784	honestly by the prick of their needles, but it will
785	be thought we keep a bawdy house straight.
786	
787	[NYM and PISTOL draw]
788	
789	O well a day, Lady, if he be not drawn now! we
790	shall see wilful adultery and murder committed.
791	
792	BARDOLPH	Good lieutenant! good corporal! offer nothing here.
793	
794	NYM	Pish!
795	
796	PISTOL	Pish for thee, Iceland dog! thou prick-ear'd cur of Iceland!
797	
798	Hostess	Good Corporal Nym, show thy valour, and put up your sword.
799	
800	NYM	Will you shog off? I would have you solus.
801	
802	PISTOL	'Solus,' egregious dog? O viper vile!
803	The 'solus' in thy most mervailous face;
804	The 'solus' in thy teeth, and in thy throat,
805	And in thy hateful lungs, yea, in thy maw, perdy,
806	And, which is worse, within thy nasty mouth!
807	I do retort the 'solus' in thy bowels;
808	For I can take, and Pistol's cock is up,
809	And flashing fire will follow.
810	
811	NYM	I am not Barbason; you cannot conjure me. I have an
812	humour to knock you indifferently well. If you grow
813	foul with me, Pistol, I will scour you with my
814	rapier, as I may, in fair terms: if you would walk
815	off, I would prick your guts a little, in good
816	terms, as I may: and that's the humour of it.
817	
818	PISTOL	O braggart vile and damned furious wight!
819	The grave doth gape, and doting death is near;
820	Therefore exhale.
821	
822	BARDOLPH	Hear me, hear me what I say: he that strikes the
823	first stroke, I'll run him up to the hilts, as I am a soldier.
824	
825	[Draws]
826	
827	PISTOL	An oath of mickle might; and fury shall abate.
828	Give me thy fist, thy fore-foot to me give:
829	Thy spirits are most tall.
830	
831	NYM	I will cut thy throat, one time or other, in fair
832	terms: that is the humour of it.
833	
834	PISTOL	'Couple a gorge!'
835	That is the word. I thee defy again.
836	O hound of Crete, think'st thou my spouse to get?
837	No; to the spital go,
838	And from the powdering tub of infamy
839	Fetch forth the lazar kite of Cressid's kind,
840	Doll Tearsheet she by name, and her espouse:
841	I have, and I will hold, the quondam Quickly
842	For the only she; and--pauca, there's enough. Go to.
843	
844	[Enter the Boy]
845	
846	Boy	Mine host Pistol, you must come to my master, and
847	you, hostess: he is very sick, and would to bed.
848	Good Bardolph, put thy face between his sheets, and
849	do the office of a warming-pan. Faith, he's very ill.
850	
851	BARDOLPH	Away, you rogue!
852	
853	Hostess	By my troth, he'll yield the crow a pudding one of
854	these days. The king has killed his heart. Good
855	husband, come home presently.
856	
857	[Exeunt Hostess and Boy]
858	
859	BARDOLPH	Come, shall I make you two friends? We must to
860	France together: why the devil should we keep
861	knives to cut one another's throats?
862	
863	PISTOL	Let floods o'erswell, and fiends for food howl on!
864	
865	NYM	You'll pay me the eight shillings I won of you at betting?
866	
867	PISTOL	Base is the slave that pays.
868	
869	NYM	That now I will have: that's the humour of it.
870	
871	PISTOL	As manhood shall compound: push home.
872	
873	[They draw]
874	
875	BARDOLPH	By this sword, he that makes the first thrust, I'll
876	kill him; by this sword, I will.
877	
878	PISTOL	Sword is an oath, and oaths must have their course.
879	
880	BARDOLPH	Corporal Nym, an thou wilt be friends, be friends:
881	an thou wilt not, why, then, be enemies with me too.
882	Prithee, put up.
883	
884	NYM	I shall have my eight shillings I won of you at betting?
885	
886	PISTOL	A noble shalt thou have, and present pay;
887	And liquor likewise will I give to thee,
888	And friendship shall combine, and brotherhood:
889	I'll live by Nym, and Nym shall live by me;
890	Is not this just? for I shall sutler be
891	Unto the camp, and profits will accrue.
892	Give me thy hand.
893	
894	NYM	I shall have my noble?
895	
896	PISTOL	In cash most justly paid.
897	
898	NYM	Well, then, that's the humour of't.
899	
900	[Re-enter Hostess]
901	
902	Hostess	As ever you came of women, come in quickly to Sir
903	John. Ah, poor heart! he is so shaked of a burning
904	quotidian tertian, that it is most lamentable to
905	behold. Sweet men, come to him.
906	
907	NYM	The king hath run bad humours on the knight; that's
908	the even of it.
909	
910	PISTOL	Nym, thou hast spoke the right;
911	His heart is fracted and corroborate.
912	
913	NYM	The king is a good king: but it must be as it may;
914	he passes some humours and careers.
915	
916	PISTOL	Let us condole the knight; for, lambkins we will live.

929	
930	
931	[Enter EXETER, BEDFORD, and WESTMORELAND]
932	
933	BEDFORD	'Fore God, his grace is bold, to trust these traitors.
934	
935	EXETER	They shall be apprehended by and by.
936	
937	WESTMORELAND	How smooth and even they do bear themselves!
938	As if allegiance in their bosoms sat,
939	Crowned with faith and constant loyalty.
940	
941	BEDFORD	The king hath note of all that they intend,
942	By interception which they dream not of.
943	
944	EXETER	Nay, but the man that was his bedfellow,
945	Whom he hath dull'd and cloy'd with gracious favours,
946	That he should, for a foreign purse, so sell
947	His sovereign's life to death and treachery.
948	
949	[Trumpets sound. Enter KING HENRY V, SCROOP,
950	CAMBRIDGE, GREY, and Attendants]
951	
952	KING HENRY V	Now sits the wind fair, and we will aboard.
953	My Lord of Cambridge, and my kind Lord of Masham,
954	And you, my gentle knight, give me your thoughts:
955	Think you not that the powers we bear with us
956	Will cut their passage through the force of France,
957	Doing the execution and the act
958	For which we have in head assembled them?
959	
960	SCROOP	No doubt, my liege, if each man do his best.
961	
962	KING HENRY V	I doubt not that; since we are well persuaded
963	We carry not a heart with us from hence
964	That grows not in a fair consent with ours,
965	Nor leave not one behind that doth not wish
966	Success and conquest to attend on us.
967	
968	CAMBRIDGE	Never was monarch better fear'd and loved
969	Than is your majesty: there's not, I think, a subject
970	That sits in heart-grief and uneasiness
971	Under the sweet shade of your government.
972	
973	GREY	True: those that were your father's enemies
974	Have steep'd their galls in honey and do serve you
975	With hearts create of duty and of zeal.
976	
977	KING HENRY V	We therefore have great cause of thankfulness;
978	And shall forget the office of our hand,
979	Sooner than quittance of desert and merit
980	According to the weight and worthiness.
981	
982	SCROOP	So service shall with steeled sinews toil,
983	And labour shall refresh itself with hope,
984	To do your grace incessant services.
985	
986	KING HENRY V	We judge no less. Uncle of Exeter,
987	Enlarge the man committed yesterday,
988	That rail'd against our person: we consider
989	it was excess of wine that set him on;
990	And on his more advice we pardon him.
991	
992	SCROOP	That's mercy, but too much security:
993	Let him be punish'd, sovereign, lest example
994	Breed, by his sufferance, more of such a kind.
995	
996	KING HENRY V	O, let us yet be merciful.
997	
998	CAMBRIDGE	So may your highness, and yet punish too.
999	
1000	GREY	Sir,
1001	You show great mercy, if you give him life,
1002	After the taste of much correction.
1003	
1004	KING HENRY V	Alas, your too much love and care of me
1005	Are heavy orisons 'gainst this poor wretch!
1006	If little faults, proceeding on distemper,
1007	Shall not be wink'd at, how shall we stretch our eye
1008	When capital crimes, chew'd, swallow'd and digested,
1009	Appear before us? We'll yet enlarge that man,
1010	Though Cambridge, Scroop and Grey, in their dear care
1011	And tender preservation of our person,
1012	Would have him punished. And now to our French causes:
1013	Who are the late commissioners?
1014	
1015	CAMBRIDGE	I one, my lord:
1016	Your highness bade me ask for it to-day.
1017	
1018	SCROOP	So did you me, my liege.
1019	
1020	GREY	And I, my royal sovereign.
1021	
1022	KING HENRY V	Then, Richard Earl of Cambridge, there is yours;
1023	There yours, Lord Scroop of Masham; and, sir knight,
1024	Grey of Northumberland, this same is yours:
1025	Read them; and know, I know your worthiness.
1026	My Lord of Westmoreland, and uncle Exeter,
1027	We will aboard to night. Why, how now, gentlemen!
1028	What see you in those papers that you lose
1029	So much complexion? Look ye, how they change!
1030	Their cheeks are paper. Why, what read you there
1031	That hath so cowarded and chased your blood
1032	Out of appearance?
1033	
1034	CAMBRIDGE	                  I do confess my fault;
1035	And do submit me to your highness' mercy.
1036	
1037	
1038	GREY	|
1039	|  To which we all appeal.
1040	SCROOP	|
1041	
1042	
1043	KING HENRY V	The mercy that was quick in us but late,
1044	By your own counsel is suppress'd and kill'd:
1045	You must not dare, for shame, to talk of mercy;
1046	For your own reasons turn into your bosoms,
1047	As dogs upon their masters, worrying you.
1048	See you, my princes, and my noble peers,
1049	These English monsters! My Lord of Cambridge here,
1050	You know how apt our love was to accord
1051	To furnish him with all appertinents
1052	Belonging to his honour; and this man
1053	Hath, for a few light crowns, lightly conspired,
1054	And sworn unto the practises of France,
1055	To kill us here in Hampton: to the which
1056	This knight, no less for bounty bound to us
1057	Than Cambridge is, hath likewise sworn. But, O,
1058	What shall I say to thee, Lord Scroop? thou cruel,
1059	Ingrateful, savage and inhuman creature!
1060	Thou that didst bear the key of all my counsels,
1061	That knew'st the very bottom of my soul,
1062	That almost mightst have coin'd me into gold,
1063	Wouldst thou have practised on me for thy use,
1064	May it be possible, that foreign hire
1065	Could out of thee extract one spark of evil
1066	That might annoy my finger? 'tis so strange,
1067	That, though the truth of it stands off as gross
1068	As black and white, my eye will scarcely see it.
1069	Treason and murder ever kept together,
1070	As two yoke-devils sworn to either's purpose,
1071	Working so grossly in a natural cause,
1072	That admiration did not whoop at them:
1073	But thou, 'gainst all proportion, didst bring in
1074	Wonder to wait on treason and on murder:
1075	And whatsoever cunning fiend it was
1076	That wrought upon thee so preposterously
1077	Hath got the voice in hell for excellence:
1078	All other devils that suggest by treasons
1079	Do botch and bungle up damnation
1080	With patches, colours, and with forms being fetch'd
1081	From glistering semblances of piety;
1082	But he that temper'd thee bade thee stand up,
1083	Gave thee no instance why thou shouldst do treason,
1084	Unless to dub thee with the name of traitor.
1085	If that same demon that hath gull'd thee thus
1086	Should with his lion gait walk the whole world,
1087	He might return to vasty Tartar back,
1088	And tell the legions 'I can never win
1089	A soul so easy as that Englishman's.'
1090	O, how hast thou with 'jealousy infected
1091	The sweetness of affiance! Show men dutiful?
1092	Why, so didst thou: seem they grave and learned?
1093	Why, so didst thou: come they of noble family?
1094	Why, so didst thou: seem they religious?
1095	Why, so didst thou: or are they spare in diet,
1096	Free from gross passion or of mirth or anger,
1097	Constant in spirit, not swerving with the blood,
1098	Garnish'd and deck'd in modest complement,
1099	Not working with the eye without the ear,
1100	And but in purged judgment trusting neither?
1101	Such and so finely bolted didst thou seem:
1102	And thus thy fall hath left a kind of blot,
1103	To mark the full-fraught man and best indued
1104	With some suspicion. I will weep for thee;
1105	For this revolt of thine, methinks, is like
1106	Another fall of man. Their faults are open:
1107	Arrest them to the answer of the law;
1108	And God acquit them of their practises!
1109	
1110	EXETER	   I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
1111	Richard Earl of Cambridge.
1112	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
1113	Henry Lord Scroop of Masham.
1114	I arrest thee of high treason, by the name of
1115	Thomas Grey, knight, of Northumberland.
1116	
1117	SCROOP	Our purposes God justly hath discover'd;
1118	And I repent my fault more than my death;
1119	Which I beseech your highness to forgive,
1120	Although my body pay the price of it.
1121	
1122	CAMBRIDGE	For me, the gold of France did not seduce;
1123	Although I did admit it as a motive
1124	The sooner to effect what I intended:
1125	But God be thanked for prevention;
1126	Which I in sufferance heartily will rejoice,
1127	Beseeching God and you to pardon me.
1128	
1129	GREY	Never did faithful subject more rejoice
1130	At the discovery of most dangerous treason
1131	Than I do at this hour joy o'er myself.
1132	Prevented from a damned enterprise:
1133	My fault, but not my body, pardon, sovereign.
1134	
1135	KING HENRY V	God quit you in his mercy! Hear your sentence.
1136	You have conspired against our royal person,
1137	Join'd with an enemy proclaim'd and from his coffers
1138	Received the golden earnest of our death;
1139	Wherein you would have sold your king to slaughter,
1140	His princes and his peers to servitude,
1141	His subjects to oppression and contempt
1142	And his whole kingdom into desolation.
1143	Touching our person seek we no revenge;
1144	But we our kingdom's safety must so tender,
1145	Whose ruin you have sought, that to her laws
1146	We do deliver you. Get you therefore hence,
1147	Poor miserable wretches, to your death:
1148	The taste whereof, God of his mercy give
1149	You patience to endure, and true repentance
1150	Of all your dear offences! Bear them hence.
1151	
1152	[Exeunt CAMBRIDGE, SCROOP and GREY, guarded]
1153	
1154	Now, lords, for France; the enterprise whereof
1155	Shall be to you, as us, like glorious.
1156	We doubt not of a fair and lucky war,
1157	Since God so graciously hath brought to light
1158	This dangerous treason lurking in our way
1159	To hinder our beginnings. We doubt not now
1160	But every rub is smoothed on our way.
1161	Then forth, dear countrymen: let us deliver
1162	Our puissance into the hand of God,
1163	Putting it straight in expedition.
1164	Cheerly to sea; the signs of war advance:
1165	No king of England, if not king of France.

1183	
1184	Hostess	Prithee, honey-sweet husband, let me bring thee to Staines.
1185	
1186	PISTOL	No; for my manly heart doth yearn.
1187	Bardolph, be blithe: Nym, rouse thy vaunting veins:
1188	Boy, bristle thy courage up; for Falstaff he is dead,
1189	And we must yearn therefore.
1190	
1191	BARDOLPH	Would I were with him, wheresome'er he is, either in
1192	heaven or in hell!
1193	
1194	Hostess	Nay, sure, he's not in hell: he's in Arthur's
1195	bosom, if ever man went to Arthur's bosom. A' made
1196	a finer end and went away an it had been any
1197	christom child; a' parted even just between twelve
1198	and one, even at the turning o' the tide: for after
1199	I saw him fumble with the sheets and play with
1200	flowers and smile upon his fingers' ends, I knew
1201	there was but one way; for his nose was as sharp as
1202	a pen, and a' babbled of green fields. 'How now,
1203	sir John!' quoth I	'what, man! be o' good
1204	cheer.' So a' cried out 'God, God, God!' three or
1205	four times. Now I, to comfort him, bid him a'
1206	should not think of God; I hoped there was no need
1207	to trouble himself with any such thoughts yet. So
1208	a' bade me lay more clothes on his feet: I put my
1209	hand into the bed and felt them, and they were as
1210	cold as any stone; then I felt to his knees, and
1211	they were as cold as any stone, and so upward and
1212	upward, and all was as cold as any stone.
1213	
1214	NYM	They say he cried out of sack.
1215	
1216	Hostess	Ay, that a' did.
1217	
1218	BARDOLPH	And of women.
1219	
1220	Hostess	Nay, that a' did not.
1221	
1222	Boy	Yes, that a' did; and said they were devils
1223	incarnate.
1224	
1225	Hostess	A' could never abide carnation; 'twas a colour he
1226	never liked.
1227	
1228	Boy	A' said once, the devil would have him about women.
1229	
1230	Hostess	A' did in some sort, indeed, handle women; but then
1231	he was rheumatic, and talked of the whore of Babylon.
1232	
1233	Boy	Do you not remember, a' saw a flea stick upon
1234	Bardolph's nose, and a' said it was a black soul
1235	burning in hell-fire?
1236	
1237	BARDOLPH	Well, the fuel is gone that maintained that fire:
1238	that's all the riches I got in his service.
1239	
1240	NYM	Shall we shog? the king will be gone from
1241	Southampton.
1242	
1243	PISTOL	Come, let's away. My love, give me thy lips.
1244	Look to my chattels and my movables:
1245	Let senses rule; the word is 'Pitch and Pay:'
1246	Trust none;
1247	For oaths are straws, men's faiths are wafer-cakes,
1248	And hold-fast is the only dog, my duck:
1249	Therefore, Caveto be thy counsellor.
1250	Go, clear thy crystals. Yoke-fellows in arms,
1251	Let us to France; like horse-leeches, my boys,
1252	To suck, to suck, the very blood to suck!
1253	
1254	Boy	And that's but unwholesome food they say.
1255	
1256	PISTOL	Touch her soft mouth, and march.
1257	
1258	BARDOLPH	Farewell, hostess.

1279	
1280	SCENE IV	France. The KING'S palace.
1281	
1282	
1283	[Flourish. Enter the FRENCH KING, the DAUPHIN, the
1284	DUKES of BERRI and BRETAGNE, the Constable, and others]
1285	
1286	KING OF FRANCE	Thus comes the English with full power upon us;
1287	And more than carefully it us concerns
1288	To answer royally in our defences.
1289	Therefore the Dukes of Berri and of Bretagne,
1290	Of Brabant and of Orleans, shall make forth,
1291	And you, Prince Dauphin, with all swift dispatch,
1292	To line and new repair our towns of war
1293	With men of courage and with means defendant;
1294	For England his approaches makes as fierce
1295	As waters to the sucking of a gulf.
1296	It fits us then to be as provident
1297	As fear may teach us out of late examples
1298	Left by the fatal and neglected English
1299	Upon our fields.
1300	
1301	DAUPHIN	                  My most redoubted father,
1302	It is most meet we arm us 'gainst the foe;
1303	For peace itself should not so dull a kingdom,
1304	Though war nor no known quarrel were in question,
1305	But that defences, musters, preparations,
1306	Should be maintain'd, assembled and collected,
1307	As were a war in expectation.
1308	Therefore, I say 'tis meet we all go forth
1309	To view the sick and feeble parts of France:
1310	And let us do it with no show of fear;
1311	No, with no more than if we heard that England
1312	Were busied with a Whitsun morris-dance:
1313	For, my good liege, she is so idly king'd,
1314	Her sceptre so fantastically borne
1315	By a vain, giddy, shallow, humorous youth,
1316	That fear attends her not.
1317	
1318	Constable	O peace, Prince Dauphin!
1319	You are too much mistaken in this king:
1320	Question your grace the late ambassadors,
1321	With what great state he heard their embassy,
1322	How well supplied with noble counsellors,
1323	How modest in exception, and withal
1324	How terrible in constant resolution,
1325	And you shall find his vanities forespent
1326	Were but the outside of the Roman Brutus,
1327	Covering discretion with a coat of folly;
1328	As gardeners do with ordure hide those roots
1329	That shall first spring and be most delicate.
1330	
1331	DAUPHIN	Well, 'tis not so, my lord high constable;
1332	But though we think it so, it is no matter:
1333	In cases of defence 'tis best to weigh
1334	The enemy more mighty than he seems:
1335	So the proportions of defence are fill'd;
1336	Which of a weak or niggardly projection
1337	Doth, like a miser, spoil his coat with scanting
1338	A little cloth.
1339	
1340	KING OF FRANCE	                  Think we King Harry strong;
1341	And, princes, look you strongly arm to meet him.
1342	The kindred of him hath been flesh'd upon us;
1343	And he is bred out of that bloody strain
1344	That haunted us in our familiar paths:
1345	Witness our too much memorable shame
1346	When Cressy battle fatally was struck,
1347	And all our princes captiv'd by the hand
1348	Of that black name, Edward, Black Prince of Wales;
1349	Whiles that his mountain sire, on mountain standing,
1350	Up in the air, crown'd with the golden sun,
1351	Saw his heroical seed, and smiled to see him,
1352	Mangle the work of nature and deface
1353	The patterns that by God and by French fathers
1354	Had twenty years been made. This is a stem
1355	Of that victorious stock; and let us fear
1356	The native mightiness and fate of him.
1357	
1358	[Enter a Messenger]
1359	
1360	Messenger	Ambassadors from Harry King of England
1361	Do crave admittance to your majesty.
1362	
1363	KING OF FRANCE	We'll give them present audience. Go, and bring them.
1364	
1365	[Exeunt Messenger and certain Lords]
1366	
1367	You see this chase is hotly follow'd, friends.
1368	
1369	DAUPHIN	Turn head, and stop pursuit; for coward dogs
1370	Most spend their mouths when what they seem to threaten
1371	Runs far before them. Good my sovereign,
1372	Take up the English short, and let them know
1373	Of what a monarchy you are the head:
1374	Self-love, my liege, is not so vile a sin
1375	As self-neglecting.
1376	
1377	[Re-enter Lords, with EXETER and train]
1378	
1379	KING OF FRANCE	From our brother England?
1380	
1381	EXETER	From him; and thus he greets your majesty.
1382	He wills you, in the name of God Almighty,
1383	That you divest yourself, and lay apart
1384	The borrow'd glories that by gift of heaven,
1385	By law of nature and of nations, 'long
1386	To him and to his heirs; namely, the crown
1387	And all wide-stretched honours that pertain
1388	By custom and the ordinance of times
1389	Unto the crown of France. That you may know
1390	'Tis no sinister nor no awkward claim,
1391	Pick'd from the worm-holes of long-vanish'd days,
1392	Nor from the dust of old oblivion raked,
1393	He sends you this most memorable line,
1394	In every branch truly demonstrative;
1395	Willing to overlook this pedigree:
1396	And when you find him evenly derived
1397	From his most famed of famous ancestors,
1398	Edward the Third, he bids you then resign
1399	Your crown and kingdom, indirectly held
1400	From him the native and true challenger.
1401	
1402	KING OF FRANCE	Or else what follows?
1403	
1404	EXETER	Bloody constraint; for if you hide the crown
1405	Even in your hearts, there will he rake for it:
1406	Therefore in fierce tempest is he coming,
1407	In thunder and in earthquake, like a Jove,
1408	That, if requiring fail, he will compel;
1409	And bids you, in the bowels of the Lord,
1410	Deliver up the crown, and to take mercy
1411	On the poor souls for whom this hungry war
1412	Opens his vasty jaws; and on your head
1413	Turning the widows' tears, the orphans' cries
1414	The dead men's blood, the pining maidens groans,
1415	For husbands, fathers and betrothed lovers,
1416	That shall be swallow'd in this controversy.
1417	This is his claim, his threatening and my message;
1418	Unless the Dauphin be in presence here,
1419	To whom expressly I bring greeting too.
1420	
1421	KING OF FRANCE	For us, we will consider of this further:
1422	To-morrow shall you bear our full intent
1423	Back to our brother England.
1424	
1425	DAUPHIN	For the Dauphin,
1426	I stand here for him: what to him from England?
1427	
1428	EXETER	Scorn and defiance; slight regard, contempt,
1429	And any thing that may not misbecome
1430	The mighty sender, doth he prize you at.
1431	Thus says my king; an' if your father's highness
1432	Do not, in grant of all demands at large,
1433	Sweeten the bitter mock you sent his majesty,
1434	He'll call you to so hot an answer of it,
1435	That caves and womby vaultages of France
1436	Shall chide your trespass and return your mock
1437	In second accent of his ordnance.
1438	
1439	DAUPHIN	Say, if my father render fair return,
1440	It is against my will; for I desire
1441	Nothing but odds with England: to that end,
1442	As matching to his youth and vanity,
1443	I did present him with the Paris balls.
1444	
1445	EXETER	He'll make your Paris Louvre shake for it,
1446	Were it the mistress-court of mighty Europe:
1447	And, be assured, you'll find a difference,
1448	As we his subjects have in wonder found,
1449	Between the promise of his greener days
1450	And these he masters now: now he weighs time
1451	Even to the utmost grain: that you shall read
1452	In your own losses, if he stay in France.
1453	
1454	KING OF FRANCE	To-morrow shall you know our mind at full.
1455	
1456	EXETER	Dispatch us with all speed, lest that our king
1457	Come here himself to question our delay;
1458	For he is footed in this land already.
1459	
1460	KING OF FRANCE	You shall be soon dispatch's with fair conditions:
1461	A night is but small breath and little pause
1462	To answer matters of this consequence.

1477	
1478	[Enter Chorus]
1479	
1480	Chorus	Thus with imagined wing our swift scene flies
1481	In motion of no less celerity
1482	Than that of thought. Suppose that you have seen
1483	The well-appointed king at Hampton pier
1484	Embark his royalty; and his brave fleet
1485	With silken streamers the young Phoebus fanning:
1486	Play with your fancies, and in them behold
1487	Upon the hempen tackle ship-boys climbing;
1488	Hear the shrill whistle which doth order give
1489	To sounds confused; behold the threaden sails,
1490	Borne with the invisible and creeping wind,
1491	Draw the huge bottoms through the furrow'd sea,
1492	Breasting the lofty surge: O, do but think
1493	You stand upon the ravage and behold
1494	A city on the inconstant billows dancing;
1495	For so appears this fleet majestical,
1496	Holding due course to Harfleur. Follow, follow:
1497	Grapple your minds to sternage of this navy,
1498	And leave your England, as dead midnight still,
1499	Guarded with grandsires, babies and old women,
1500	Either past or not arrived to pith and puissance;
1501	For who is he, whose chin is but enrich'd
1502	With one appearing hair, that will not follow
1503	These cull'd and choice-drawn cavaliers to France?
1504	Work, work your thoughts, and therein see a siege;
1505	Behold the ordnance on their carriages,
1506	With fatal mouths gaping on girded Harfleur.
1507	Suppose the ambassador from the French comes back;
1508	Tells Harry that the king doth offer him
1509	Katharine his daughter, and with her, to dowry,
1510	Some petty and unprofitable dukedoms.
1511	The offer likes not: and the nimble gunner
1512	With linstock now the devilish cannon touches,
1513	
1514	[Alarum, and chambers go off]
1515	
1516	And down goes all before them. Still be kind,
1517	And eke out our performance with your mind.

1536	
1537	KING HENRY V	Once more unto the breach, dear friends, once more;
1538	Or close the wall up with our English dead.
1539	In peace there's nothing so becomes a man
1540	As modest stillness and humility:
1541	But when the blast of war blows in our ears,
1542	Then imitate the action of the tiger;
1543	Stiffen the sinews, summon up the blood,
1544	Disguise fair nature with hard-favour'd rage;
1545	Then lend the eye a terrible aspect;
1546	Let pry through the portage of the head
1547	Like the brass cannon; let the brow o'erwhelm it
1548	As fearfully as doth a galled rock
1549	O'erhang and jutty his confounded base,
1550	Swill'd with the wild and wasteful ocean.
1551	Now set the teeth and stretch the nostril wide,
1552	Hold hard the breath and bend up every spirit
1553	To his full height. On, on, you noblest English.
1554	Whose blood is fet from fathers of war-proof!
1555	Fathers that, like so many Alexanders,
1556	Have in these parts from morn till even fought
1557	And sheathed their swords for lack of argument:
1558	Dishonour not your mothers; now attest
1559	That those whom you call'd fathers did beget you.
1560	Be copy now to men of grosser blood,
1561	And teach them how to war. And you, good yeoman,
1562	Whose limbs were made in England, show us here
1563	The mettle of your pasture; let us swear
1564	That you are worth your breeding; which I doubt not;
1565	For there is none of you so mean and base,
1566	That hath not noble lustre in your eyes.
1567	I see you stand like greyhounds in the slips,
1568	Straining upon the start. The game's afoot:
1569	Follow your spirit, and upon this charge
1570	Cry 'God for Harry, England, and Saint George!'

1592	and, for mine own part, I have not a case of lives:
1593	the humour of it is too hot, that is the very
1594	plain-song of it.
1595	
1596	PISTOL	The plain-song is most just: for humours do abound:
1597	Knocks go and come; God's vassals drop and die;
1598	And sword and shield,
1599	In bloody field,
1600	Doth win immortal fame.

1627	
1628	Boy	As young as I am, I have observed these three
1629	swashers. I am boy to them all three: but all they
1630	three, though they would serve me, could not be man
1631	to me; for indeed three such antics do not amount to
1632	a man. For Bardolph, he is white-livered and
1633	red-faced; by the means whereof a' faces it out, but
1634	fights not. For Pistol, he hath a killing tongue
1635	and a quiet sword; by the means whereof a' breaks
1636	words, and keeps whole weapons. For Nym, he hath
1637	heard that men of few words are the best men; and
1638	therefore he scorns to say his prayers, lest a'
1639	should be thought a coward: but his few bad words
1640	are matched with as few good deeds; for a' never
1641	broke any man's head but his own, and that was
1642	against a post when he was drunk. They will steal
1643	any thing, and call it purchase. Bardolph stole a
1644	lute-case, bore it twelve leagues, and sold it for
1645	three half pence. Nym and Bardolph are sworn
1646	brothers in filching, and in Calais they stole a
1647	fire-shovel: I knew by that piece of service the
1648	men would carry coals. They would have me as
1649	familiar with men's pockets as their gloves or their
1650	handkerchers: which makes much against my manhood,
1651	if I should take from another's pocket to put into
1652	mine; for it is plain pocketing up of wrongs. I
1653	must leave them, and seek some better service:
1654	their villany goes against my weak stomach, and
1655	therefore I must cast it up.
1656	
1657	[Exit]
1658	
1659	[Re-enter FLUELLEN, GOWER following]
1660	
1661	GOWER	Captain Fluellen, you must come presently to the
1662	mines; the Duke of Gloucester would speak with you.
1663	
1664	FLUELLEN	To the mines! tell you the duke, it is not so good
1665	to come to the mines; for, look you, the mines is
1666	not according to the disciplines of the war: the
1667	concavities of it is not sufficient; for, look you,
1668	the athversary, you may discuss unto the duke, look
1669	you, is digt himself four yard under the
1670	countermines: by Cheshu, I think a' will plough up
1671	all, if there is not better directions.
1672	
1673	GOWER	The Duke of Gloucester, to whom the order of the
1674	siege is given, is altogether directed by an
1675	Irishman, a very valiant gentleman, i' faith.
1676	
1677	FLUELLEN	It is Captain Macmorris, is it not?
1678	
1679	GOWER	I think it be.
1680	
1681	FLUELLEN	By Cheshu, he is an ass, as in the world: I will
1682	verify as much in his beard: be has no more
1683	directions in the true disciplines of the wars, look
1684	you, of the Roman disciplines, than is a puppy-dog.
1685	
1686	[Enter MACMORRIS and Captain JAMY]
1687	
1688	GOWER	Here a' comes; and the Scots captain, Captain Jamy, with him.
1689	
1690	FLUELLEN	Captain Jamy is a marvellous falourous gentleman,
1691	that is certain; and of great expedition and
1692	knowledge in th' aunchient wars, upon my particular
1693	knowledge of his directions: by Cheshu, he will
1694	maintain his argument as well as any military man in
1695	the world, in the disciplines of the pristine wars
1696	of the Romans.
1697	
1698	JAMY	I say gud-day, Captain Fluellen.
1699	
1700	FLUELLEN	God-den to your worship, good Captain James.
1701	
1702	GOWER	How now, Captain Macmorris! have you quit the
1703	mines? have the pioneers given o'er?
1704	
1705	MACMORRIS	By Chrish, la! tish ill done: the work ish give
1706	over, the trompet sound the retreat. By my hand, I
1707	swear, and my father's soul, the work ish ill done;
1708	it ish give over: I would have blowed up the town, so
1709	Chrish save me, la! in an hour: O, tish ill done,
1710	tish ill done; by my hand, tish ill done!
1711	
1712	FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I beseech you now, will you
1713	voutsafe me, look you, a few disputations with you,
1714	as partly touching or concerning the disciplines of
1715	the war, the Roman wars, in the way of argument,
1716	look you, and friendly communication; partly to
1717	satisfy my opinion, and partly for the satisfaction,
1718	look you, of my mind, as touching the direction of
1719	the military discipline; that is the point.
1720	
1721	JAMY	It sall be vary gud, gud feith, gud captains bath:
1722	and I sall quit you with gud leve, as I may pick
1723	occasion; that sall I, marry.
1724	
1725	MACMORRIS	It is no time to discourse, so Chrish save me: the
1726	day is hot, and the weather, and the wars, and the
1727	king, and the dukes: it is no time to discourse. The
1728	town is beseeched, and the trumpet call us to the
1729	breach; and we talk, and, be Chrish, do nothing:
1730	'tis shame for us all: so God sa' me, 'tis shame to
1731	stand still; it is shame, by my hand: and there is
1732	throats to be cut, and works to be done; and there
1733	ish nothing done, so Chrish sa' me, la!
1734	
1735	JAMY	By the mess, ere theise eyes of mine take themselves
1736	to slomber, ay'll de gud service, or ay'll lig i'
1737	the grund for it; ay, or go to death; and ay'll pay
1738	't as valourously as I may, that sall I suerly do,
1739	that is the breff and the long. Marry, I wad full
1740	fain hear some question 'tween you tway.
1741	
1742	FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, I think, look you, under your
1743	correction, there is not many of your nation--
1744	
1745	MACMORRIS	Of my nation! What ish my nation? Ish a villain,
1746	and a bastard, and a knave, and a rascal. What ish
1747	my nation? Who talks of my nation?
1748	
1749	FLUELLEN	Look you, if you take the matter otherwise than is
1750	meant, Captain Macmorris, peradventure I shall think
1751	you do not use me with that affability as in
1752	discretion you ought to use me, look you: being as
1753	good a man as yourself, both in the disciplines of
1754	war, and in the derivation of my birth, and in
1755	other particularities.
1756	
1757	MACMORRIS	I do not know you so good a man as myself: so
1758	Chrish save me, I will cut off your head.
1759	
1760	GOWER	Gentlemen both, you will mistake each other.
1761	
1762	JAMY	A! that's a foul fault.
1763	
1764	[A parley sounded]
1765	
1766	GOWER	The town sounds a parley.
1767	
1768	FLUELLEN	Captain Macmorris, when there is more better
1769	opportunity to be required, look you, I will be so
1770	bold as to tell you I know the disciplines of war;
1771	and there is an end.

1788	[The Governor and some Citizens on the walls; the
1789	English forces below. Enter KING HENRY and his train]
1790	
1791	KING HENRY V	How yet resolves the governor of the town?
1792	This is the latest parle we will admit;
1793	Therefore to our best mercy give yourselves;
1794	Or like to men proud of destruction
1795	Defy us to our worst: for, as I am a soldier,
1796	A name that in my thoughts becomes me best,
1797	If I begin the battery once again,
1798	I will not leave the half-achieved Harfleur
1799	Till in her ashes she lie buried.
1800	The gates of mercy shall be all shut up,
1801	And the flesh'd soldier, rough and hard of heart,
1802	In liberty of bloody hand shall range
1803	With conscience wide as hell, mowing like grass
1804	Your fresh-fair virgins and your flowering infants.
1805	What is it then to me, if impious war,
1806	Array'd in flames like to the prince of fiends,
1807	Do, with his smirch'd complexion, all fell feats
1808	Enlink'd to waste and desolation?
1809	What is't to me, when you yourselves are cause,
1810	If your pure maidens fall into the hand
1811	Of hot and forcing violation?
1812	What rein can hold licentious wickedness
1813	When down the hill he holds his fierce career?
1814	We may as bootless spend our vain command
1815	Upon the enraged soldiers in their spoil
1816	As send precepts to the leviathan
1817	To come ashore. Therefore, you men of Harfleur,
1818	Take pity of your town and of your people,
1819	Whiles yet my soldiers are in my command;
1820	Whiles yet the cool and temperate wind of grace
1821	O'erblows the filthy and contagious clouds
1822	Of heady murder, spoil and villany.
1823	If not, why, in a moment look to see
1824	The blind and bloody soldier with foul hand
1825	Defile the locks of your shrill-shrieking daughters;
1826	Your fathers taken by the silver beards,
1827	And their most reverend heads dash'd to the walls,
1828	Your naked infants spitted upon pikes,
1829	Whiles the mad mothers with their howls confused
1830	Do break the clouds, as did the wives of Jewry
1831	At Herod's bloody-hunting slaughtermen.
1832	What say you? will you yield, and this avoid,
1833	Or, guilty in defence, be thus destroy'd?
1834	
1835	GOVERNOR	Our expectation hath this day an end:
1836	The Dauphin, whom of succors we entreated,
1837	Returns us that his powers are yet not ready
1838	To raise so great a siege. Therefore, great king,
1839	We yield our town and lives to thy soft mercy.
1840	Enter our gates; dispose of us and ours;
1841	For we no longer are defensible.
1842	
1843	KING HENRY V	Open your gates. Come, uncle Exeter,
1844	Go you and enter Harfleur; there remain,
1845	And fortify it strongly 'gainst the French:
1846	Use mercy to them all. For us, dear uncle,
1847	The winter coming on and sickness growing
1848	Upon our soldiers, we will retire to Calais.
1849	To-night in Harfleur we will be your guest;
1850	To-morrow for the march are we addrest.

1882	appeles de fingres; oui, de fingres.
1883	
1884	KATHARINE	La main, de hand; les doigts, de fingres. Je pense

1947	de son mauvais, corruptible, gros, et impudique, et
1948	non pour les dames d'honneur d'user: je ne voudrais

1978	
1979	Constable	And if he be not fought withal, my lord,
1980	Let us not live in France; let us quit all
1981	And give our vineyards to a barbarous people.
1982	
1983	DAUPHIN	O Dieu vivant! shall a few sprays of us,
1984	The emptying of our fathers' luxury,
1985	Our scions, put in wild and savage stock,
1986	Spirt up so suddenly into the clouds,
1987	And overlook their grafters?

1993	In that nook-shotten isle of Albion.
1994	
1995	Constable	Dieu de batailles! where have they this mettle?
1996	Is not their climate foggy, raw and dull,
1997	On whom, as in despite, the sun looks pale,
1998	Killing their fruit with frowns? Can sodden water,
1999	A drench for sur-rein'd jades, their barley-broth,
2000	Decoct their cold blood to such valiant heat?
2001	And shall our quick blood, spirited with wine,
2002	Seem frosty? O, for honour of our land,
2003	Let us not hang like roping icicles
2004	Upon our houses' thatch, whiles a more frosty people
2005	Sweat drops of gallant youth in our rich fields!
2006	Poor we may call them in their native lords.
2007	
2008	DAUPHIN	By faith and honour,
2009	Our madams mock at us, and plainly say
2010	Our mettle is bred out and they will give
2011	Their bodies to the lust of English youth
2012	To new-store France with bastard warriors.
2013	
2014	BOURBON	They bid us to the English dancing-schools,
2015	And teach lavoltas high and swift corantos;
2016	Saying our grace is only in our heels,
2017	And that we are most lofty runaways.
2018	
2019	KING OF FRANCE	Where is Montjoy the herald? speed him hence:

2021	Up, princes! and, with spirit of honour edged
2022	More sharper than your swords, hie to the field:
2023	Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
2024	You Dukes of Orleans, Bourbon, and of Berri,
2025	Alencon, Brabant, Bar, and Burgundy;
2026	Jaques Chatillon, Rambures, Vaudemont,
2027	Beaumont, Grandpre, Roussi, and Fauconberg,
2028	Foix, Lestrale, Bouciqualt, and Charolois;
2029	High dukes, great princes, barons, lords and knights,
2030	For your great seats now quit you of great shames.
2031	Bar Harry England, that sweeps through our land
2032	With pennons painted in the blood of Harfleur:
2033	Rush on his host, as doth the melted snow
2034	Upon the valleys, whose low vassal seat
2035	The Alps doth spit and void his rheum upon:
2036	Go down upon him, you have power enough,
2037	And in a captive chariot into Rouen
2038	Bring him our prisoner.
2039	
2040	Constable	This becomes the great.
2041	Sorry am I his numbers are so few,
2042	His soldiers sick and famish'd in their march,
2043	For I am sure, when he shall see our army,
2044	He'll drop his heart into the sink of fear
2045	And for achievement offer us his ransom.
2046	
2047	KING OF FRANCE	Therefore, lord constable, haste on Montjoy.
2048	And let him say to England that we send
2049	To know what willing ransom he will give.

2075	GOWER	How now, Captain Fluellen! come you from the bridge?
2076	
2077	FLUELLEN	I assure you, there is very excellent services
2078	committed at the bridge.
2079	
2080	GOWER	Is the Duke of Exeter safe?
2081	
2082	FLUELLEN	The Duke of Exeter is as magnanimous as Agamemnon;
2083	and a man that I love and honour with my soul, and my
2084	heart, and my duty, and my life, and my living, and
2085	my uttermost power: he is not-God be praised and
2086	blessed!--any hurt in the world; but keeps the
2087	bridge most valiantly, with excellent discipline.
2088	There is an aunchient lieutenant there at the
2089	pridge, I think in my very conscience he is as
2090	valiant a man as Mark Antony; and he is a man of no
2091	estimation in the world; but did see him do as
2092	gallant service.
2093	
2094	GOWER	What do you call him?
2095

2105	The Duke of Exeter doth love thee well.
2106	
2107	FLUELLEN	Ay, I praise God; and I have merited some love at
2108	his hands.

2110	PISTOL	Bardolph, a soldier, firm and sound of heart,
2111	And of buxom valour, hath, by cruel fate,
2112	And giddy Fortune's furious fickle wheel,
2113	That goddess blind,
2114	That stands upon the rolling restless stone--
2115	
2116	FLUELLEN	By your patience, Aunchient Pistol. Fortune is
2117	painted blind, with a muffler afore her eyes, to
2118	signify to you that Fortune is blind; and she is
2119	painted also with a wheel, to signify to you, which
2120	is the moral of it, that she is turning, and
2121	inconstant, and mutability, and variation: and her
2122	foot, look you, is fixed upon a spherical stone,
2123	which rolls, and rolls, and rolls: in good truth,
2124	the poet makes a most excellent description of it:
2125	Fortune is an excellent moral.
2126	
2127	PISTOL	Fortune is Bardolph's foe, and frowns on him;
2128	For he hath stolen a pax, and hanged must a' be:
2129	A damned death!
2130	Let gallows gape for dog; let man go free
2131	And let not hemp his wind-pipe suffocate:
2132	But Exeter hath given the doom of death
2133	For pax of little price.
2134	Therefore, go speak: the duke will hear thy voice:
2135	And let not Bardolph's vital thread be cut
2136	With edge of penny cord and vile reproach:
2137	Speak, captain, for his life, and I will thee requite.
2138	
2139	FLUELLEN	Aunchient Pistol, I do partly understand your meaning.
2140	
2141	PISTOL	Why then, rejoice therefore.
2142	
2143	FLUELLEN	Certainly, aunchient, it is not a thing to rejoice
2144	at: for if, look you, he were my brother, I would
2145	desire the duke to use his good pleasure, and put
2146	him to execution; for discipline ought to be used.
2147	
2148	PISTOL	Die and be damn'd! and figo for thy friendship!
2149	
2150	FLUELLEN	It is well.
2151	
2152	PISTOL	The fig of Spain!
2153	
2154	[Exit]
2155	
2156	FLUELLEN	Very good.
2157	
2158	GOWER	Why, this is an arrant counterfeit rascal; I
2159	remember him now; a bawd, a cutpurse.
2160	
2161	FLUELLEN	I'll assure you, a' uttered as brave words at the
2162	bridge as you shall see in a summer's day. But it
2163	is very well; what he has spoke to me, that is well,
2164	I warrant you, when time is serve.
2165	
2166	GOWER	Why, 'tis a gull, a fool, a rogue, that now and then
2167	goes to the wars, to grace himself at his return
2168	into London under the form of a soldier. And such
2169	fellows are perfect in the great commanders' names:
2170	and they will learn you by rote where services were
2171	done; at such and such a sconce, at such a breach,
2172	at such a convoy; who came off bravely, who was
2173	shot, who disgraced, what terms the enemy stood on;
2174	and this they con perfectly in the phrase of war,
2175	which they trick up with new-tuned oaths: and what
2176	a beard of the general's cut and a horrid suit of
2177	the camp will do among foaming bottles and
2178	ale-washed wits, is wonderful to be thought on. But
2179	you must learn to know such slanders of the age, or
2180	else you may be marvellously mistook.
2181	
2182	FLUELLEN	I tell you what, Captain Gower; I do perceive he is
2183	not the man that he would gladly make show to the
2184	world he is: if I find a hole in his coat, I will
2185	tell him my mind.
2186	
2187	[Drum heard]
2188	
2189	Hark you, the king is coming, and I must speak with
2190	him from the pridge.
2191	
2192	[Drum and colours. Enter KING HENRY, GLOUCESTER, and Soldiers]
2193	
2194	God pless your majesty!
2195	
2196	KING HENRY V	How now, Fluellen! camest thou from the bridge?
2197	
2198	FLUELLEN	Ay, so please your majesty. The Duke of Exeter has
2199	very gallantly maintained the pridge: the French is
2200	gone off, look you; and there is gallant and most
2201	prave passages; marry, th' athversary was have
2202	possession of the pridge; but he is enforced to
2203	retire, and the Duke of Exeter is master of the
2204	pridge: I can tell your majesty, the duke is a
2205	prave man.
2206	
2207	KING HENRY V	What men have you lost, Fluellen?
2208	
2209	FLUELLEN	The perdition of th' athversary hath been very
2210	great, reasonable great: marry, for my part, I
2211	think the duke hath lost never a man, but one that
2212	is like to be executed for robbing a church, one
2213	Bardolph, if your majesty know the man: his face is
2214	all bubukles, and whelks, and knobs, and flames o'
2215	fire: and his lips blows at his nose, and it is like
2216	a coal of fire, sometimes plue and sometimes red;
2217	but his nose is executed and his fire's out.
2218	
2219	KING HENRY V	We would have all such offenders so cut off: and we
2220	give express charge, that in our marches through the
2221	country, there be nothing compelled from the
2222	villages, nothing taken but paid for, none of the
2223	French upbraided or abused in disdainful language;
2224	for when lenity and cruelty play for a kingdom, the
2225	gentler gamester is the soonest winner.
2226	
2227	[Tucket. Enter MONTJOY]
2228	
2229	MONTJOY	You know me by my habit.
2230	
2231	KING HENRY V	Well then I know thee: what shall I know of thee?
2232	
2233	MONTJOY	My master's mind.
2234	
2235	KING HENRY V	Unfold it.
2236	
2237	MONTJOY	Thus says my king: Say thou to Harry of England:
2238	Though we seemed dead, we did but sleep: advantage
2239	is a better soldier than rashness. Tell him we
2240	could have rebuked him at Harfleur, but that we
2241	thought not good to bruise an injury till it were
2242	full ripe: now we speak upon our cue, and our voice
2243	is imperial: England shall repent his folly, see
2244	his weakness, and admire our sufferance. Bid him
2245	therefore consider of his ransom; which must
2246	proportion the losses we have borne, the subjects we
2247	have lost, the disgrace we have digested; which in
2248	weight to re-answer, his pettiness would bow under.
2249	For our losses, his exchequer is too poor; for the
2250	effusion of our blood, the muster of his kingdom too
2251	faint a number; and for our disgrace, his own
2252	person, kneeling at our feet, but a weak and
2253	worthless satisfaction. To this add defiance: and
2254	tell him, for conclusion, he hath betrayed his
2255	followers, whose condemnation is pronounced. So far
2256	my king and master; so much my office.
2257	
2258	KING HENRY V	What is thy name? I know thy quality.
2259	
2260	MONTJOY	Montjoy.
2261	
2262	KING HENRY V	Thou dost thy office fairly. Turn thee back.
2263	And tell thy king I do not seek him now;
2264	But could be willing to march on to Calais
2265	Without impeachment: for, to say the sooth,
2266	Though 'tis no wisdom to confess so much
2267	Unto an enemy of craft and vantage,
2268	My people are with sickness much enfeebled,
2269	My numbers lessened, and those few I have
2270	Almost no better than so many French;
2271	Who when they were in health, I tell thee, herald,
2272	I thought upon one pair of English legs
2273	Did march three Frenchmen. Yet, forgive me, God,
2274	That I do brag thus! This your air of France
2275	Hath blown that vice in me: I must repent.
2276	Go therefore, tell thy master here I am;
2277	My ransom is this frail and worthless trunk,
2278	My army but a weak and sickly guard;
2279	Yet, God before, tell him we will come on,
2280	Though France himself and such another neighbour
2281	Stand in our way. There's for thy labour, Montjoy.
2282	Go bid thy master well advise himself:
2283	If we may pass, we will; if we be hinder'd,
2284	We shall your tawny ground with your red blood
2285	Discolour: and so Montjoy, fare you well.
2286	The sum of all our answer is but this:
2287	We would not seek a battle, as we are;
2288	Nor, as we are, we say we will not shun it:
2289	So tell your master.
2290	
2291	MONTJOY	I shall deliver so. Thanks to your highness.
2292	
2293	[Exit]
2294	
2295	GLOUCESTER	I hope they will not come upon us now.
2296	
2297	KING HENRY V	We are in God's hand, brother, not in theirs.
2298	March to the bridge; it now draws toward night:
2299	Beyond the river we'll encamp ourselves,
2300	And on to-morrow, bid them march away.
2301

2312	
2313	
2314	SCENE VII	The French camp, near Agincourt:
2315	
2316	
2317	[Enter the Constable of France, the LORD RAMBURES,
2318	ORLEANS, DAUPHIN, with others]
2319	
2320	Constable	Tut! I have the best armour of the world. Would it were day!
2321	
2322	ORLEANS	You have an excellent armour; but let my horse have his due.
2323	
2324	Constable	It is the best horse of Europe.
2325	
2326	ORLEANS	Will it never be morning?
2327	
2328	DAUPHIN	My lord of Orleans, and my lord high constable, you
2329	talk of horse and armour?
2330	
2331	ORLEANS	You are as well provided of both as any prince in the world.
2332	
2333	DAUPHIN	What a long night is this! I will not change my
2334	horse with any that treads but on four pasterns.
2335	Ca, ha! he bounds from the earth, as if his
2336	entrails were hairs; le cheval volant, the Pegasus,
2337	chez les narines de feu! When I bestride him, I
2338	soar, I am a hawk: he trots the air; the earth
2339	sings when he touches it; the basest horn of his
2340	hoof is more musical than the pipe of Hermes.
2341	
2342	ORLEANS	He's of the colour of the nutmeg.
2343	
2344	DAUPHIN	And of the heat of the ginger. It is a beast for
2345	Perseus: he is pure air and fire; and the dull
2346	elements of earth and water never appear in him, but
2347	only in Patient stillness while his rider mounts
2348	him: he is indeed a horse; and all other jades you
2349	may call beasts.
2350	
2351	Constable	Indeed, my lord, it is a most absolute and excellent horse.
2352	
2353	DAUPHIN	It is the prince of palfreys; his neigh is like the
2354	bidding of a monarch and his countenance enforces homage.
2355	
2356	ORLEANS	No more, cousin.
2357	
2358	DAUPHIN	Nay, the man hath no wit that cannot, from the
2359	rising of the lark to the lodging of the lamb, vary
2360	deserved praise on my palfrey: it is a theme as
2361	fluent as the sea: turn the sands into eloquent
2362	tongues, and my horse is argument for them all:
2363	'tis a subject for a sovereign to reason on, and for
2364	a sovereign's sovereign to ride on; and for the
2365	world, familiar to us and unknown to lay apart
2366	their particular functions and wonder at him. I
2367	once writ a sonnet in his praise and began thus:
2368	'Wonder of nature,'--
2369	
2370	ORLEANS	I have heard a sonnet begin so to one's mistress.
2371	
2372	DAUPHIN	Then did they imitate that which I composed to my
2373	courser, for my horse is my mistress.
2374	
2375	ORLEANS	Your mistress bears well.
2376	
2377	DAUPHIN	Me well; which is the prescript praise and
2378	perfection of a good and particular mistress.
2379	
2380	Constable	Nay, for methought yesterday your mistress shrewdly
2381	shook your back.
2382	
2383	DAUPHIN	So perhaps did yours.
2384	
2385	Constable	Mine was not bridled.
2386	
2387	DAUPHIN	O then belike she was old and gentle; and you rode,
2388	like a kern of Ireland, your French hose off, and in
2389	your straight strossers.
2390	
2391	Constable	You have good judgment in horsemanship.
2392	
2393	DAUPHIN	Be warned by me, then: they that ride so and ride
2394	not warily, fall into foul bogs. I had rather have
2395	my horse to my mistress.
2396	
2397	Constable	I had as lief have my mistress a jade.
2398	
2399	DAUPHIN	I tell thee, constable, my mistress wears his own hair.
2400	
2401	Constable	I could make as true a boast as that, if I had a sow
2402	to my mistress.
2403	
2404	DAUPHIN	'Le chien est retourne a son propre vomissement, et
2405	la truie lavee au bourbier;' thou makest use of any thing.
2406	
2407	Constable	Yet do I not use my horse for my mistress, or any
2408	such proverb so little kin to the purpose.
2409	
2410	RAMBURES	My lord constable, the armour that I saw in your tent
2411	to-night, are those stars or suns upon it?
2412	
2413	Constable	Stars, my lord.
2414	
2415	DAUPHIN	Some of them will fall to-morrow, I hope.
2416	
2417	Constable	And yet my sky shall not want.
2418	
2419	DAUPHIN	That may be, for you bear a many superfluously, and
2420	'twere more honour some were away.
2421	
2422	Constable	Even as your horse bears your praises; who would
2423	trot as well, were some of your brags dismounted.
2424	
2425	DAUPHIN	Would I were able to load him with his desert! Will
2426	it never be day? I will trot to-morrow a mile, and
2427	my way shall be paved with English faces.
2428	
2429	Constable	I will not say so, for fear I should be faced out of
2430	my way: but I would it were morning; for I would
2431	fain be about the ears of the English.
2432	
2433	RAMBURES	Who will go to hazard with me for twenty prisoners?
2434	
2435	Constable	You must first go yourself to hazard, ere you have them.
2436	
2437	DAUPHIN	'Tis midnight; I'll go arm myself.
2438	
2439	[Exit]
2440	
2441	ORLEANS	The Dauphin longs for morning.
2442	
2443	RAMBURES	He longs to eat the English.
2444	
2445	Constable	I think he will eat all he kills.
2446	
2447	ORLEANS	By the white hand of my lady, he's a gallant prince.
2448	
2449	Constable	Swear by her foot, that she may tread out the oath.
2450	
2451	ORLEANS	He is simply the most active gentleman of France.
2452	
2453	Constable	Doing is activity; and he will still be doing.
2454	
2455	ORLEANS	He never did harm, that I heard of.
2456	
2457	Constable	Nor will do none to-morrow: he will keep that good name still.
2458	
2459	ORLEANS	I know him to be valiant.
2460	
2461	Constable	I was told that by one that knows him better than
2462	you.
2463	
2464	ORLEANS	What's he?
2465	
2466	Constable	Marry, he told me so himself; and he said he cared
2467	not who knew it
2468	
2469	ORLEANS	He needs not; it is no hidden virtue in him.
2470	
2471	Constable	By my faith, sir, but it is; never any body saw it
2472	but his lackey: 'tis a hooded valour; and when it
2473	appears, it will bate.
2474	
2475	ORLEANS	Ill will never said well.
2476	
2477	Constable	I will cap that proverb with 'There is flattery in friendship.'
2478	
2479	ORLEANS	And I will take up that with 'Give the devil his due.'
2480	
2481	Constable	Well placed: there stands your friend for the
2482	devil: have at the very eye of that proverb with 'A
2483	pox of the devil.'
2484	
2485	ORLEANS	You are the better at proverbs, by how much 'A
2486	fool's bolt is soon shot.'
2487	
2488	Constable	You have shot over.
2489	
2490	ORLEANS	'Tis not the first time you were overshot.
2491	
2492	[Enter a Messenger]
2493	
2494	Messenger	My lord high constable, the English lie within
2495	fifteen hundred paces of your tents.
2496	
2497	Constable	Who hath measured the ground?
2498	
2499	Messenger	The Lord Grandpre.
2500	
2501	Constable	A valiant and most expert gentleman. Would it were
2502	day! Alas, poor Harry of England! he longs not for
2503	the dawning as we do.
2504	
2505	ORLEANS	What a wretched and peevish fellow is this king of
2506	England, to mope with his fat-brained followers so
2507	far out of his knowledge!
2508	
2509	Constable	If the English had any apprehension, they would run away.
2510	
2511	ORLEANS	That they lack; for if their heads had any
2512	intellectual armour, they could never wear such heavy
2513	head-pieces.
2514	
2515	RAMBURES	That island of England breeds very valiant
2516	creatures; their mastiffs are of unmatchable courage.
2517	
2518	ORLEANS	Foolish curs, that run winking into the mouth of a
2519	Russian bear and have their heads crushed like
2520	rotten apples! You may as well say, that's a
2521	valiant flea that dare eat his breakfast on the lip of a lion.
2522	
2523	Constable	Just, just; and the men do sympathize with the
2524	mastiffs in robustious and rough coming on, leaving
2525	their wits with their wives: and then give them
2526	great meals of beef and iron and steel, they will
2527	eat like wolves and fight like devils.
2528	
2529	ORLEANS	Ay, but these English are shrewdly out of beef.
2530	
2531	Constable	Then shall we find to-morrow they have only stomachs
2532	to eat and none to fight. Now is it time to arm:
2533	come, shall we about it?
2534	
2535	ORLEANS	It is now two o'clock: but, let me see, by ten
2536	We shall have each a hundred Englishmen.

2549	PROLOGUE.
2550	
2551	
2552	[Enter Chorus]
2553	
2554	Chorus	Now entertain conjecture of a time
2555	When creeping murmur and the poring dark
2556	Fills the wide vessel of the universe.
2557	From camp to camp through the foul womb of night
2558	The hum of either army stilly sounds,
2559	That the fixed sentinels almost receive
2560	The secret whispers of each other's watch:
2561	Fire answers fire, and through their paly flames
2562	Each battle sees the other's umber'd face;
2563	Steed threatens steed, in high and boastful neighs
2564	Piercing the night's dull ear, and from the tents
2565	The armourers, accomplishing the knights,
2566	With busy hammers closing rivets up,
2567	Give dreadful note of preparation:
2568	The country cocks do crow, the clocks do toll,
2569	And the third hour of drowsy morning name.
2570	Proud of their numbers and secure in soul,
2571	The confident and over-lusty French
2572	Do the low-rated English play at dice;
2573	And chide the cripple tardy-gaited night
2574	Who, like a foul and ugly witch, doth limp
2575	So tediously away. The poor condemned English,
2576	Like sacrifices, by their watchful fires
2577	Sit patiently and inly ruminate
2578	The morning's danger, and their gesture sad
2579	Investing lank-lean; cheeks and war-worn coats
2580	Presenteth them unto the gazing moon
2581	So many horrid ghosts. O now, who will behold
2582	The royal captain of this ruin'd band
2583	Walking from watch to watch, from tent to tent,
2584	Let him cry 'Praise and glory on his head!'
2585	For forth he goes and visits all his host.
2586	Bids them good morrow with a modest smile
2587	And calls them brothers, friends and countrymen.
2588	Upon his royal face there is no note
2589	How dread an army hath enrounded him;
2590	Nor doth he dedicate one jot of colour
2591	Unto the weary and all-watched night,
2592	But freshly looks and over-bears attaint
2593	With cheerful semblance and sweet majesty;
2594	That every wretch, pining and pale before,
2595	Beholding him, plucks comfort from his looks:
2596	A largess universal like the sun
2597	His liberal eye doth give to every one,
2598	Thawing cold fear, that mean and gentle all,
2599	Behold, as may unworthiness define,
2600	A little touch of Harry in the night.
2601	And so our scene must to the battle fly;
2602	Where--O for pity!--we shall much disgrace
2603	With four or five most vile and ragged foils,
2604	Right ill-disposed in brawl ridiculous,
2605	The name of Agincourt. Yet sit and see,
2606	Minding true things by what their mockeries be.

2624	
2625	KING HENRY V	Gloucester, 'tis true that we are in great danger;
2626	The greater therefore should our courage be.
2627	Good morrow, brother Bedford. God Almighty!
2628	There is some soul of goodness in things evil,
2629	Would men observingly distil it out.
2630	For our bad neighbour makes us early stirrers,
2631	Which is both healthful and good husbandry:
2632	Besides, they are our outward consciences,
2633	And preachers to us all, admonishing
2634	That we should dress us fairly for our end.
2635	Thus may we gather honey from the weed,
2636	And make a moral of the devil himself.
2637	
2638	[Enter ERPINGHAM]
2639	
2640	Good morrow, old Sir Thomas Erpingham:

2644	ERPINGHAM	Not so, my liege: this lodging likes me better,
2645	Since I may say 'Now lie I like a king.'
2646	
2647	KING HENRY V	'Tis good for men to love their present pains
2648	Upon example; so the spirit is eased:
2649	And when the mind is quicken'd, out of doubt,
2650	The organs, though defunct and dead before,
2651	Break up their drowsy grave and newly move,
2652	With casted slough and fresh legerity.
2653	Lend me thy cloak, Sir Thomas. Brothers both,
2654	Commend me to the princes in our camp;
2655	Do my good morrow to them, and anon
2656	Desire them an to my pavilion.
2657	
2658	GLOUCESTER	We shall, my liege.
2659	
2660	ERPINGHAM	Shall I attend your grace?
2661	
2662	KING HENRY V	No, my good knight;
2663	Go with my brothers to my lords of England:
2664	I and my bosom must debate awhile,
2665	And then I would no other company.
2666	
2667	ERPINGHAM	The Lord in heaven bless thee, noble Harry!
2668	
2669	[Exeunt all but KING HENRY]
2670	
2671	KING HENRY V	God-a-mercy, old heart! thou speak'st cheerfully.
2672	
2673	[Enter PISTOL]
2674	
2675	PISTOL	Qui va la?
2676	
2677	KING HENRY V	A friend.
2678	
2679	PISTOL	Discuss unto me; art thou officer?
2680	Or art thou base, common and popular?
2681	
2682	KING HENRY V	I am a gentleman of a company.
2683	
2684	PISTOL	Trail'st thou the puissant pike?
2685	
2686	KING HENRY V	Even so. What are you?
2687	
2688	PISTOL	As good a gentleman as the emperor.
2689	
2690	KING HENRY V	Then you are a better than the king.
2691	
2692	PISTOL	The king's a bawcock, and a heart of gold,
2693	A lad of life, an imp of fame;
2694	Of parents good, of fist most valiant.
2695	I kiss his dirty shoe, and from heart-string
2696	I love the lovely bully. What is thy name?
2697	
2698	KING HENRY V	Harry le Roy.
2699	
2700	PISTOL	Le Roy! a Cornish name: art thou of Cornish crew?
2701	
2702	KING HENRY V	No, I am a Welshman.
2703	
2704	PISTOL	Know'st thou Fluellen?
2705	
2706	KING HENRY V	Yes.
2707	
2708	PISTOL	Tell him, I'll knock his leek about his pate
2709	Upon Saint Davy's day.
2710	
2711	KING HENRY V	Do not you wear your dagger in your cap that day,
2712	lest he knock that about yours.
2713	
2714	PISTOL	Art thou his friend?
2715	
2716	KING HENRY V	And his kinsman too.
2717	
2718	PISTOL	The figo for thee, then!
2719	
2720	KING HENRY V	I thank you: God be with you!
2721	
2722	PISTOL	My name is Pistol call'd.
2723	
2724	[Exit]
2725	
2726	KING HENRY V	It sorts well with your fierceness.
2727	
2728	[Enter FLUELLEN and GOWER]
2729	
2730	GOWER	Captain Fluellen!
2731	
2732	FLUELLEN	So! in the name of Jesu Christ, speak lower. It is
2733	the greatest admiration of the universal world, when
2734	the true and aunchient prerogatifes and laws of the
2735	wars is not kept: if you would take the pains but to
2736	examine the wars of Pompey the Great, you shall
2737	find, I warrant you, that there is no tiddle toddle
2738	nor pibble pabble in Pompey's camp; I warrant you,
2739	you shall find the ceremonies of the wars, and the
2740	cares of it, and the forms of it, and the sobriety
2741	of it, and the modesty of it, to be otherwise.
2742	
2743	GOWER	Why, the enemy is loud; you hear him all night.
2744	
2745	FLUELLEN	If the enemy is an ass and a fool and a prating
2746	coxcomb, is it meet, think you, that we should also,
2747	look you, be an ass and a fool and a prating
2748	coxcomb? in your own conscience, now?
2749	
2750	GOWER	I will speak lower.
2751	
2752	FLUELLEN	I pray you and beseech you that you will.
2753	
2754	[Exeunt GOWER and FLUELLEN]
2755	
2756	KING HENRY V	Though it appear a little out of fashion,
2757	There is much care and valour in this Welshman.
2758	
2759	[Enter three soldiers, JOHN BATES, ALEXANDER COURT,
2760	and MICHAEL WILLIAMS]
2761	
2762	COURT	Brother John Bates, is not that the morning which
2763	breaks yonder?
2764	
2765	BATES	I think it be: but we have no great cause to desire
2766	the approach of day.
2767	
2768	WILLIAMS	We see yonder the beginning of the day, but I think
2769	we shall never see the end of it. Who goes there?
2770	
2771	KING HENRY V	A friend.
2772	
2773	WILLIAMS	Under what captain serve you?
2774	
2775	KING HENRY V	Under Sir Thomas Erpingham.
2776	
2777	WILLIAMS	A good old commander and a most kind gentleman: I
2778	pray you, what thinks he of our estate?
2779	
2780	KING HENRY V	Even as men wrecked upon a sand, that look to be
2781	washed off the next tide.
2782	
2783	BATES	He hath not told his thought to the king?
2784	
2785	KING HENRY V	No; nor it is not meet he should. For, though I
2786	speak it to you, I think the king is but a man, as I
2787	am: the violet smells to him as it doth to me: the
2788	element shows to him as it doth to me; all his
2789	senses have but human conditions: his ceremonies
2790	laid by, in his nakedness he appears but a man; and
2791	though his affections are higher mounted than ours,
2792	yet, when they stoop, they stoop with the like
2793	wing. Therefore when he sees reason of fears, as we
2794	do, his fears, out of doubt, be of the same relish
2795	as ours are: yet, in reason, no man should possess
2796	him with any appearance of fear, lest he, by showing
2797	it, should dishearten his army.
2798	
2799	BATES	He may show what outward courage he will; but I
2800	believe, as cold a night as 'tis, he could wish
2801	himself in Thames up to the neck; and so I would he
2802	were, and I by him, at all adventures, so we were quit here.
2803	
2804	KING HENRY V	By my troth, I will speak my conscience of the king:
2805	I think he would not wish himself any where but
2806	where he is.
2807	
2808	BATES	Then I would he were here alone; so should he be
2809	sure to be ransomed, and a many poor men's lives saved.
2810	
2811	KING HENRY V	I dare say you love him not so ill, to wish him here
2812	alone, howsoever you speak this to feel other men's
2813	minds: methinks I could not die any where so
2814	contented as in the king's company; his cause being
2815	just and his quarrel honourable.
2816	
2817	WILLIAMS	That's more than we know.
2818	
2819	BATES	Ay, or more than we should seek after; for we know
2820	enough, if we know we are the kings subjects: if
2821	his cause be wrong, our obedience to the king wipes
2822	the crime of it out of us.
2823	
2824	WILLIAMS	But if the cause be not good, the king himself hath
2825	a heavy reckoning to make, when all those legs and
2826	arms and heads, chopped off in battle, shall join
2827	together at the latter day and cry all 'We died at
2828	such a place;' some swearing, some crying for a
2829	surgeon, some upon their wives left poor behind
2830	them, some upon the debts they owe, some upon their
2831	children rawly left. I am afeard there are few die
2832	well that die in a battle; for how can they
2833	charitably dispose of any thing, when blood is their
2834	argument? Now, if these men do not die well, it
2835	will be a black matter for the king that led them to
2836	it; whom to disobey were against all proportion of
2837	subjection.
2838	
2839	KING HENRY V	So, if a son that is by his father sent about
2840	merchandise do sinfully miscarry upon the sea, the
2841	imputation of his wickedness by your rule, should be
2842	imposed upon his father that sent him: or if a
2843	servant, under his master's command transporting a
2844	sum of money, be assailed by robbers and die in
2845	many irreconciled iniquities, you may call the
2846	business of the master the author of the servant's
2847	damnation: but this is not so: the king is not
2848	bound to answer the particular endings of his
2849	soldiers, the father of his son, nor the master of
2850	his servant; for they purpose not their death, when
2851	they purpose their services. Besides, there is no
2852	king, be his cause never so spotless, if it come to
2853	the arbitrement of swords, can try it out with all
2854	unspotted soldiers: some peradventure have on them
2855	the guilt of premeditated and contrived murder;
2856	some, of beguiling virgins with the broken seals of
2857	perjury; some, making the wars their bulwark, that
2858	have before gored the gentle bosom of peace with
2859	pillage and robbery. Now, if these men have
2860	defeated the law and outrun native punishment,
2861	though they can outstrip men, they have no wings to
2862	fly from God: war is his beadle, war is vengeance;
2863	so that here men are punished for before-breach of
2864	the king's laws in now the king's quarrel: where
2865	they feared the death, they have borne life away;
2866	and where they would be safe, they perish: then if
2867	they die unprovided, no more is the king guilty of
2868	their damnation than he was before guilty of those
2869	impieties for the which they are now visited. Every
2870	subject's duty is the king's; but every subject's
2871	soul is his own. Therefore should every soldier in
2872	the wars do as every sick man in his bed, wash every
2873	mote out of his conscience: and dying so, death
2874	is to him advantage; or not dying, the time was
2875	blessedly lost wherein such preparation was gained:
2876	and in him that escapes, it were not sin to think
2877	that, making God so free an offer, He let him
2878	outlive that day to see His greatness and to teach
2879	others how they should prepare.
2880	
2881	WILLIAMS	'Tis certain, every man that dies ill, the ill upon
2882	his own head, the king is not to answer it.
2883	
2884	BATES	But I do not desire he should answer for me; and
2885	yet I determine to fight lustily for him.
2886	
2887	KING HENRY V	I myself heard the king say he would not be ransomed.
2888	
2889	WILLIAMS	Ay, he said so, to make us fight cheerfully: but
2890	when our throats are cut, he may be ransomed, and we
2891	ne'er the wiser.
2892	
2893	KING HENRY V	If I live to see it, I will never trust his word after.
2894	
2895	WILLIAMS	You pay him then. That's a perilous shot out of an
2896	elder-gun, that a poor and private displeasure can
2897	do against a monarch! you may as well go about to
2898	turn the sun to ice with fanning in his face with a
2899	peacock's feather. You'll never trust his word
2900	after! come, 'tis a foolish saying.
2901	
2902	KING HENRY V	Your reproof is something too round: I should be
2903	angry with you, if the time were convenient.
2904	
2905	WILLIAMS	Let it be a quarrel between us, if you live.
2906	
2907	KING HENRY V	I embrace it.
2908	
2909	WILLIAMS	How shall I know thee again?
2910	
2911	KING HENRY V	Give me any gage of thine, and I will wear it in my
2912	bonnet: then, if ever thou darest acknowledge it, I
2913	will make it my quarrel.
2914	
2915	WILLIAMS	Here's my glove: give me another of thine.
2916	
2917	KING HENRY V	There.
2918	
2919	WILLIAMS	This will I also wear in my cap: if ever thou come
2920	to me and say, after to-morrow, 'This is my glove,'
2921	by this hand, I will take thee a box on the ear.
2922	
2923	KING HENRY V	If ever I live to see it, I will challenge it.
2924	
2925	WILLIAMS	Thou darest as well be hanged.
2926	
2927	KING HENRY V	Well. I will do it, though I take thee in the
2928	king's company.
2929	
2930	WILLIAMS	Keep thy word: fare thee well.
2931	
2932	BATES	Be friends, you English fools, be friends: we have
2933	French quarrels enow, if you could tell how to reckon.
2934	
2935	KING HENRY V	Indeed, the French may lay twenty French crowns to
2936	one, they will beat us; for they bear them on their
2937	shoulders: but it is no English treason to cut
2938	French crowns, and to-morrow the king himself will
2939	be a clipper.
2940	
2941	[Exeunt soldiers]
2942	
2943	Upon the king! let us our lives, our souls,
2944	Our debts, our careful wives,
2945	Our children and our sins lay on the king!
2946	We must bear all. O hard condition,
2947	Twin-born with greatness, subject to the breath
2948	Of every fool, whose sense no more can feel
2949	But his own wringing! What infinite heart's-ease
2950	Must kings neglect, that private men enjoy!
2951	And what have kings, that privates have not too,
2952	Save ceremony, save general ceremony?
2953	And what art thou, thou idle ceremony?
2954	What kind of god art thou, that suffer'st more
2955	Of mortal griefs than do thy worshippers?
2956	What are thy rents? what are thy comings in?
2957	O ceremony, show me but thy worth!
2958	What is thy soul of adoration?
2959	Art thou aught else but place, degree and form,
2960	Creating awe and fear in other men?
2961	Wherein thou art less happy being fear'd
2962	Than they in fearing.
2963	What drink'st thou oft, instead of homage sweet,
2964	But poison'd flattery? O, be sick, great greatness,
2965	And bid thy ceremony give thee cure!
2966	Think'st thou the fiery fever will go out
2967	With titles blown from adulation?
2968	Will it give place to flexure and low bending?
2969	Canst thou, when thou command'st the beggar's knee,
2970	Command the health of it? No, thou proud dream,
2971	That play'st so subtly with a king's repose;
2972	I am a king that find thee, and I know
2973	'Tis not the balm, the sceptre and the ball,
2974	The sword, the mace, the crown imperial,
2975	The intertissued robe of gold and pearl,
2976	The farced title running 'fore the king,
2977	The throne he sits on, nor the tide of pomp
2978	That beats upon the high shore of this world,
2979	No, not all these, thrice-gorgeous ceremony,
2980	Not all these, laid in bed majestical,
2981	Can sleep so soundly as the wretched slave,
2982	Who with a body fill'd and vacant mind
2983	Gets him to rest, cramm'd with distressful bread;
2984	Never sees horrid night, the child of hell,
2985	But, like a lackey, from the rise to set
2986	Sweats in the eye of Phoebus and all night
2987	Sleeps in Elysium; next day after dawn,
2988	Doth rise and help Hyperion to his horse,
2989	And follows so the ever-running year,
2990	With profitable labour, to his grave:
2991	And, but for ceremony, such a wretch,
2992	Winding up days with toil and nights with sleep,
2993	Had the fore-hand and vantage of a king.
2994	The slave, a member of the country's peace,
2995	Enjoys it; but in gross brain little wots
2996	What watch the king keeps to maintain the peace,
2997	Whose hours the peasant best advantages.
2998	
2999	[Enter ERPINGHAM]
3000	
3001	ERPINGHAM	My lord, your nobles, jealous of your absence,
3002	Seek through your camp to find you.
3003	
3004	KING HENRY V	Good old knight,
3005	Collect them all together at my tent:
3006	I'll be before thee.
3007	
3008	ERPINGHAM	I shall do't, my lord.
3009	
3010	[Exit]
3011	
3012	KING HENRY V	O God of battles! steel my soldiers' hearts;
3013	Possess them not with fear; take from them now
3014	The sense of reckoning, if the opposed numbers
3015	Pluck their hearts from them. Not to-day, O Lord,
3016	O, not to-day, think not upon the fault
3017	My father made in compassing the crown!
3018	I Richard's body have interred anew;
3019	And on it have bestow'd more contrite tears
3020	Than from it issued forced drops of blood:
3021	Five hundred poor I have in yearly pay,
3022	Who twice a-day their wither'd hands hold up
3023	Toward heaven, to pardon blood; and I have built
3024	Two chantries, where the sad and solemn priests
3025	Sing still for Richard's soul. More will I do;
3026	Though all that I can do is nothing worth,
3027	Since that my penitence comes after all,
3028	Imploring pardon.
3029	
3030	[Enter GLOUCESTER]

3032	GLOUCESTER	My liege!

3050	SCENE II	The French camp.
3051	
3052	
3053	[Enter the DAUPHIN, ORLEANS, RAMBURES, and others]
3054	
3055	ORLEANS	The sun doth gild our armour; up, my lords!
3056	
3057	DAUPHIN	Montez A cheval! My horse! varlet! laquais! ha!
3058	
3059	ORLEANS	O brave spirit!
3060	
3061	DAUPHIN	Via! les eaux et la terre.
3062	
3063	ORLEANS	Rien puis? L'air et la feu.
3064	
3065	DAUPHIN	Ciel, cousin Orleans.
3066	
3067	[Enter Constable]
3068	
3069	Now, my lord constable!
3070	
3071	Constable	Hark, how our steeds for present service neigh!
3072	
3073	DAUPHIN	Mount them, and make incision in their hides,
3074	That their hot blood may spin in English eyes,
3075	And dout them with superfluous courage, ha!
3076	
3077	RAMBURES	What, will you have them weep our horses' blood?
3078	How shall we, then, behold their natural tears?
3079	
3080	[Enter Messenger]
3081	
3082	Messenger	The English are embattled, you French peers.
3083	
3084	Constable	To horse, you gallant princes! straight to horse!
3085	Do but behold yon poor and starved band,
3086	And your fair show shall suck away their souls,
3087	Leaving them but the shales and husks of men.
3088	There is not work enough for all our hands;
3089	Scarce blood enough in all their sickly veins
3090	To give each naked curtle-axe a stain,
3091	That our French gallants shall to-day draw out,
3092	And sheathe for lack of sport: let us but blow on them,
3093	The vapour of our valour will o'erturn them.
3094	'Tis positive 'gainst all exceptions, lords,
3095	That our superfluous lackeys and our peasants,
3096	Who in unnecessary action swarm
3097	About our squares of battle, were enow
3098	To purge this field of such a hilding foe,
3099	Though we upon this mountain's basis by
3100	Took stand for idle speculation:
3101	But that our honours must not. What's to say?
3102	A very little little let us do.
3103	And all is done. Then let the trumpets sound
3104	The tucket sonance and the note to mount;
3105	For our approach shall so much dare the field
3106	That England shall couch down in fear and yield.
3107	
3108	[Enter GRANDPRE]
3109	
3110	GRANDPRE	Why do you stay so long, my lords of France?
3111	Yon island carrions, desperate of their bones,
3112	Ill-favouredly become the morning field:
3113	Their ragged curtains poorly are let loose,
3114	And our air shakes them passing scornfully:
3115	Big Mars seems bankrupt in their beggar'd host
3116	And faintly through a rusty beaver peeps:
3117	The horsemen sit like fixed candlesticks,
3118	With torch-staves in their hand; and their poor jades
3119	Lob down their heads, dropping the hides and hips,
3120	The gum down-roping from their pale-dead eyes
3121	And in their pale dull mouths the gimmal bit
3122	Lies foul with chew'd grass, still and motionless;
3123	And their executors, the knavish crows,
3124	Fly o'er them, all impatient for their hour.
3125	Description cannot suit itself in words
3126	To demonstrate the life of such a battle
3127	In life so lifeless as it shows itself.
3128	
3129	Constable	They have said their prayers, and they stay for death.
3130	
3131	DAUPHIN	Shall we go send them dinners and fresh suits
3132	And give their fasting horses provender,
3133	And after fight with them?
3134	
3135	Constable	I stay but for my guidon: to the field!
3136	I will the banner from a trumpet take,
3137	And use it for my haste. Come, come, away!
3138	The sun is high, and we outwear the day.

3152	SCENE III	The English camp.
3153	
3154	
3155	[Enter GLOUCESTER, BEDFORD, EXETER, ERPINGHAM, with
3156	all his host: SALISBURY and WESTMORELAND]
3157	
3158	GLOUCESTER	Where is the king?
3159	
3160	BEDFORD	The king himself is rode to view their battle.
3161	
3162	WESTMORELAND	Of fighting men they have full three score thousand.
3163	
3164	EXETER	There's five to one; besides, they all are fresh.
3165	
3166	SALISBURY	God's arm strike with us! 'tis a fearful odds.
3167	God be wi' you, princes all; I'll to my charge:
3168	If we no more meet till we meet in heaven,
3169	Then, joyfully, my noble Lord of Bedford,
3170	My dear Lord Gloucester, and my good Lord Exeter,
3171	And my kind kinsman, warriors all, adieu!
3172	
3173	BEDFORD	Farewell, good Salisbury; and good luck go with thee!
3174	
3175	EXETER	Farewell, kind lord; fight valiantly to-day:
3176	And yet I do thee wrong to mind thee of it,
3177	For thou art framed of the firm truth of valour.
3178	
3179	[Exit SALISBURY]
3180	
3181	BEDFORD	He is full of valour as of kindness;
3182	Princely in both.
3183	
3184	[Enter the KING]
3185	
3186	WESTMORELAND	                  O that we now had here
3187	But one ten thousand of those men in England
3188	That do no work to-day!
3189	
3190	KING HENRY V	What's he that wishes so?
3191	My cousin Westmoreland? No, my fair cousin:
3192	If we are mark'd to die, we are enow
3193	To do our country loss; and if to live,
3194	The fewer men, the greater share of honour.
3195	God's will! I pray thee, wish not one man more.
3196	By Jove, I am not covetous for gold,
3197	Nor care I who doth feed upon my cost;
3198	It yearns me not if men my garments wear;
3199	Such outward things dwell not in my desires:
3200	But if it be a sin to covet honour,
3201	I am the most offending soul alive.
3202	No, faith, my coz, wish not a man from England:
3203	God's peace! I would not lose so great an honour
3204	As one man more, methinks, would share from me
3205	For the best hope I have. O, do not wish one more!
3206	Rather proclaim it, Westmoreland, through my host,
3207	That he which hath no stomach to this fight,
3208	Let him depart; his passport shall be made
3209	And crowns for convoy put into his purse:
3210	We would not die in that man's company
3211	That fears his fellowship to die with us.
3212	This day is called the feast of Crispian:
3213	He that outlives this day, and comes safe home,
3214	Will stand a tip-toe when the day is named,
3215	And rouse him at the name of Crispian.
3216	He that shall live this day, and see old age,
3217	Will yearly on the vigil feast his neighbours,
3218	And say 'To-morrow is Saint Crispian:'
3219	Then will he strip his sleeve and show his scars.
3220	And say 'These wounds I had on Crispin's day.'
3221	Old men forget: yet all shall be forgot,
3222	But he'll remember with advantages
3223	What feats he did that day: then shall our names.
3224	Familiar in his mouth as household words
3225	Harry the king, Bedford and Exeter,
3226	Warwick and Talbot, Salisbury and Gloucester,
3227	Be in their flowing cups freshly remember'd.
3228	This story shall the good man teach his son;
3229	And Crispin Crispian shall ne'er go by,
3230	From this day to the ending of the world,
3231	But we in it shall be remember'd;
3232	We few, we happy few, we band of brothers;
3233	For he to-day that sheds his blood with me
3234	Shall be my brother; be he ne'er so vile,
3235	This day shall gentle his condition:
3236	And gentlemen in England now a-bed
3237	Shall think themselves accursed they were not here,
3238	And hold their manhoods cheap whiles any speaks
3239	That fought with us upon Saint Crispin's day.
3240	
3241	[Re-enter SALISBURY]
3242	
3243	SALISBURY	My sovereign lord, bestow yourself with speed:
3244	The French are bravely in their battles set,
3245	And will with all expedience charge on us.
3246	
3247	KING HENRY V	All things are ready, if our minds be so.
3248	
3249	WESTMORELAND	Perish the man whose mind is backward now!
3250	
3251	KING HENRY V	Thou dost not wish more help from England, coz?
3252	
3253	WESTMORELAND	God's will! my liege, would you and I alone,
3254	Without more help, could fight this royal battle!
3255	
3256	KING HENRY V	Why, now thou hast unwish'd five thousand men;
3257	Which likes me better than to wish us one.
3258	You know your places: God be with you all!
3259	
3260	[Tucket. Enter MONTJOY]
3261	
3262	MONTJOY	Once more I come to know of thee, King Harry,
3263	If for thy ransom thou wilt now compound,
3264	Before thy most assured overthrow:
3265	For certainly thou art so near the gulf,
3266	Thou needs must be englutted. Besides, in mercy,
3267	The constable desires thee thou wilt mind
3268	Thy followers of repentance; that their souls
3269	May make a peaceful and a sweet retire
3270	From off these fields, where, wretches, their poor bodies
3271	Must lie and fester.
3272	
3273	KING HENRY V	Who hath sent thee now?
3274	
3275	MONTJOY	The Constable of France.
3276	
3277	KING HENRY V	I pray thee, bear my former answer back:
3278	Bid them achieve me and then sell my bones.
3279	Good God! why should they mock poor fellows thus?
3280	The man that once did sell the lion's skin
3281	While the beast lived, was killed with hunting him.
3282	A many of our bodies shall no doubt
3283	Find native graves; upon the which, I trust,
3284	Shall witness live in brass of this day's work:
3285	And those that leave their valiant bones in France,
3286	Dying like men, though buried in your dunghills,
3287	They shall be famed; for there the sun shall greet them,
3288	And draw their honours reeking up to heaven;
3289	Leaving their earthly parts to choke your clime,
3290	The smell whereof shall breed a plague in France.
3291	Mark then abounding valour in our English,
3292	That being dead, like to the bullet's grazing,
3293	Break out into a second course of mischief,
3294	Killing in relapse of mortality.
3295	Let me speak proudly: tell the constable
3296	We are but warriors for the working-day;
3297	Our gayness and our gilt are all besmirch'd
3298	With rainy marching in the painful field;
3299	There's not a piece of feather in our host--
3300	Good argument, I hope, we will not fly--
3301	And time hath worn us into slovenry:
3302	But, by the mass, our hearts are in the trim;
3303	And my poor soldiers tell me, yet ere night
3304	They'll be in fresher robes, or they will pluck
3305	The gay new coats o'er the French soldiers' heads
3306	And turn them out of service. If they do this,--
3307	As, if God please, they shall,--my ransom then
3308	Will soon be levied. Herald, save thou thy labour;
3309	Come thou no more for ransom, gentle herald:
3310	They shall have none, I swear, but these my joints;
3311	Which if they have as I will leave 'em them,
3312	Shall yield them little, tell the constable.
3313	
3314	MONTJOY	I shall, King Harry. And so fare thee well:
3315	Thou never shalt hear herald any more.
3316	
3317	[Exit]
3318	
3319	KING HENRY V	I fear thou'lt once more come again for ransom.
3320	
3321	[Enter YORK]
3322	
3323	YORK	My lord, most humbly on my knee I beg
3324	The leading of the vaward.
3325	
3326	KING HENRY V	Take it, brave York. Now, soldiers, march away:
3327	And how thou pleasest, God, dispose the day!

3345	
3346	PISTOL	Yield, cur!
3347	
3348	French Soldier	Je pense que vous etes gentilhomme de bonne qualite.
3349	
3350	PISTOL	Qualtitie calmie custure me! Art thou a gentleman?
3351	what is thy name? discuss.
3352	
3353	French Soldier	O Seigneur Dieu!
3354	
3355	PISTOL	O, Signieur Dew should be a gentleman:
3356	Perpend my words, O Signieur Dew, and mark;
3357	O Signieur Dew, thou diest on point of fox,
3358	Except, O signieur, thou do give to me
3359	Egregious ransom.
3360	
3361	French Soldier	O, prenez misericorde! ayez pitie de moi!
3362	
3363	PISTOL	Moy shall not serve; I will have forty moys;
3364	Or I will fetch thy rim out at thy throat
3365	In drops of crimson blood.
3366	
3367	French Soldier	Est-il impossible d'echapper la force de ton bras?
3368	
3369	PISTOL	Brass, cur!
3370	Thou damned and luxurious mountain goat,
3371	Offer'st me brass?
3372	
3373	French Soldier	O pardonnez moi!
3374	
3375	PISTOL	Say'st thou me so? is that a ton of moys?
3376	Come hither, boy: ask me this slave in French
3377	What is his name.
3378	
3379	Boy	Ecoutez: comment etes-vous appele?
3380	
3381	French Soldier	Monsieur le Fer.
3382	
3383	Boy	He says his name is Master Fer.
3384	
3385	PISTOL	Master Fer! I'll fer him, and firk him, and ferret
3386	him: discuss the same in French unto him.
3387	
3388	Boy	I do not know the French for fer, and ferret, and firk.
3389	
3390	PISTOL	Bid him prepare; for I will cut his throat.
3391	
3392	French Soldier	Que dit-il, monsieur?
3393	
3394	Boy	Il me commande de vous dire que vous faites vous
3395	pret; car ce soldat ici est dispose tout a cette
3396	heure de couper votre gorge.
3397	
3398	PISTOL	Owy, cuppele gorge, permafoy,
3399	Peasant, unless thou give me crowns, brave crowns;
3400	Or mangled shalt thou be by this my sword.
3401	
3402	French Soldier	O, je vous supplie, pour l'amour de Dieu, me
3403	pardonner! Je suis gentilhomme de bonne maison:
3404	gardez ma vie, et je vous donnerai deux cents ecus.
3405	
3406	PISTOL	What are his words?
3407	
3408	Boy	He prays you to save his life: he is a gentleman of
3409	a good house; and for his ransom he will give you
3410	two hundred crowns.
3411	
3412	PISTOL	Tell him my fury shall abate, and I the crowns will take.
3413	
3414	French Soldier	Petit monsieur, que dit-il?
3415	
3416	Boy	Encore qu'il est contre son jurement de pardonner
3417	aucun prisonnier, neanmoins, pour les ecus que vous
3418	l'avez promis, il est content de vous donner la
3419	liberte, le franchisement.
3420	
3421	French Soldier	Sur mes genoux je vous donne mille remercimens; et
3422	je m'estime heureux que je suis tombe entre les
3423	mains d'un chevalier, je pense, le plus brave,
3424	vaillant, et tres distingue seigneur d'Angleterre.
3425	
3426	PISTOL	Expound unto me, boy.
3427	
3428	Boy	He gives you, upon his knees, a thousand thanks; and
3429	he esteems himself happy that he hath fallen into
3430	the hands of one, as he thinks, the most brave,
3431	valorous, and thrice-worthy signieur of England.
3432	
3433	PISTOL	As I suck blood, I will some mercy show.
3434	Follow me!

3436	Boy	Suivez-vous le grand capitaine.
3437	
3438	[Exeunt PISTOL, and French Soldier]
3439	
3440	I did never know so full a voice issue from so
3441	empty a heart: but the saying is true 'The empty
3442	vessel makes the greatest sound.' Bardolph and Nym
3443	had ten times more valour than this roaring devil i'
3444	the old play, that every one may pare his nails with
3445	a wooden dagger; and they are both hanged; and so
3446	would this be, if he durst steal any thing
3447	adventurously. I must stay with the lackeys, with
3448	the luggage of our camp: the French might have a
3449	good prey of us, if he knew of it; for there is
3450	none to guard it but boys.

3483	Be these the wretches that we play'd at dice for?
3484	
3485	ORLEANS	Is this the king we sent to for his ransom?
3486	
3487	BOURBON	Shame and eternal shame, nothing but shame!
3488	Let us die in honour: once more back again;
3489	And he that will not follow Bourbon now,

3491	Like a base pander, hold the chamber-door
3492	Whilst by a slave, no gentler than my dog,
3493	His fairest daughter is contaminated.
3494

3521	
3522	KING HENRY V	Well have we done, thrice valiant countrymen:
3523	But all's not done; yet keep the French the field.
3524	
3525	EXETER	The Duke of York commends him to your majesty.
3526	
3527	KING HENRY V	Lives he, good uncle? thrice within this hour
3528	I saw him down; thrice up again and fighting;
3529	From helmet to the spur all blood he was.
3530	
3531	EXETER	In which array, brave soldier, doth he lie,
3532	Larding the plain; and by his bloody side,
3533	Yoke-fellow to his honour-owing wounds,
3534	The noble Earl of Suffolk also lies.
3535	Suffolk first died: and York, all haggled over,
3536	Comes to him, where in gore he lay insteep'd,
3537	And takes him by the beard; kisses the gashes
3538	That bloodily did spawn upon his face;
3539	And cries aloud 'Tarry, dear cousin Suffolk!
3540	My soul shall thine keep company to heaven;
3541	Tarry, sweet soul, for mine, then fly abreast,
3542	As in this glorious and well-foughten field
3543	We kept together in our chivalry!'
3544	Upon these words I came and cheer'd him up:
3545	He smiled me in the face, raught me his hand,
3546	And, with a feeble gripe, says 'Dear my lord,
3547	Commend my service to me sovereign.'
3548	So did he turn and over Suffolk's neck
3549	He threw his wounded arm and kiss'd his lips;
3550	And so espoused to death, with blood he seal'd
3551	A testament of noble-ending love.
3552	The pretty and sweet manner of it forced
3553	Those waters from me which I would have stopp'd;
3554	But I had not so much of man in me,
3555	And all my mother came into mine eyes
3556	And gave me up to tears.
3557	
3558	KING HENRY V	I blame you not;
3559	For, hearing this, I must perforce compound
3560	With mistful eyes, or they will issue too.

3585	
3586	FLUELLEN	Kill the poys and the luggage! 'tis expressly
3587	against the law of arms: 'tis as arrant a piece of
3588	knavery, mark you now, as can be offer't; in your
3589	conscience, now, is it not?
3590	
3591	GOWER	'Tis certain there's not a boy left alive; and the
3592	cowardly rascals that ran from the battle ha' done
3593	this slaughter: besides, they have burned and
3594	carried away all that was in the king's tent;
3595	wherefore the king, most worthily, hath caused every
3596	soldier to cut his prisoner's throat. O, 'tis a
3597	gallant king!
3598	
3599	FLUELLEN	Ay, he was porn at Monmouth, Captain Gower. What
3600	call you the town's name where Alexander the Pig was born!
3601	
3602	GOWER	Alexander the Great.
3603	
3604	FLUELLEN	Why, I pray you, is not pig great? the pig, or the
3605	great, or the mighty, or the huge, or the
3606	magnanimous, are all one reckonings, save the phrase
3607	is a little variations.
3608	
3609	GOWER	I think Alexander the Great was born in Macedon; his
3610	father was called Philip of Macedon, as I take it.
3611	
3612	FLUELLEN	I think it is in Macedon where Alexander is porn. I
3613	tell you, captain, if you look in the maps of the
3614	'orld, I warrant you sall find, in the comparisons
3615	between Macedon and Monmouth, that the situations,
3616	look you, is both alike. There is a river in
3617	Macedon; and there is also moreover a river at
3618	Monmouth: it is called Wye at Monmouth; but it is
3619	out of my prains what is the name of the other
3620	river; but 'tis all one, 'tis alike as my fingers is
3621	to my fingers, and there is salmons in both. If you
3622	mark Alexander's life well, Harry of Monmouth's life
3623	is come after it indifferent well; for there is
3624	figures in all things. Alexander, God knows, and
3625	you know, in his rages, and his furies, and his
3626	wraths, and his cholers, and his moods, and his
3627	displeasures, and his indignations, and also being a
3628	little intoxicates in his prains, did, in his ales and
3629	his angers, look you, kill his best friend, Cleitus.
3630	
3631	GOWER	Our king is not like him in that: he never killed
3632	any of his friends.
3633	
3634	FLUELLEN	It is not well done, mark you now take the tales out
3635	of my mouth, ere it is made and finished. I speak
3636	but in the figures and comparisons of it: as
3637	Alexander killed his friend Cleitus, being in his
3638	ales and his cups; so also Harry Monmouth, being in
3639	his right wits and his good judgments, turned away
3640	the fat knight with the great belly-doublet: he
3641	was full of jests, and gipes, and knaveries, and
3642	mocks; I have forgot his name.
3643	
3644	GOWER	Sir John Falstaff.
3645	
3646	FLUELLEN	That is he: I'll tell you there is good men porn at Monmouth.
3647

3653	KING HENRY V	I was not angry since I came to France
3654	Until this instant. Take a trumpet, herald;
3655	Ride thou unto the horsemen on yon hill:
3656	If they will fight with us, bid them come down,
3657	Or void the field; they do offend our sight:
3658	If they'll do neither, we will come to them,
3659	And make them skirr away, as swift as stones
3660	Enforced from the old Assyrian slings:
3661	Besides, we'll cut the throats of those we have,
3662	And not a man of them that we shall take
3663	Shall taste our mercy. Go and tell them so.
3664	
3665	[Enter MONTJOY]
3666	
3667	EXETER	Here comes the herald of the French, my liege.
3668	
3669	GLOUCESTER	His eyes are humbler than they used to be.
3670	
3671	KING HENRY V	How now! what means this, herald? know'st thou not
3672	That I have fined these bones of mine for ransom?
3673	Comest thou again for ransom?
3674	
3675	MONTJOY	No, great king:
3676	I come to thee for charitable licence,
3677	That we may wander o'er this bloody field
3678	To look our dead, and then to bury them;
3679	To sort our nobles from our common men.
3680	For many of our princes--woe the while!--
3681	Lie drown'd and soak'd in mercenary blood;
3682	So do our vulgar drench their peasant limbs
3683	In blood of princes; and their wounded steeds
3684	Fret fetlock deep in gore and with wild rage
3685	Yerk out their armed heels at their dead masters,
3686	Killing them twice. O, give us leave, great king,
3687	To view the field in safety and dispose
3688	Of their dead bodies!
3689	
3690	KING HENRY V	I tell thee truly, herald,
3691	I know not if the day be ours or no;
3692	For yet a many of your horsemen peer
3693	And gallop o'er the field.
3694	
3695	MONTJOY	The day is yours.
3696	
3697	KING HENRY V	Praised be God, and not our strength, for it!
3698	What is this castle call'd that stands hard by?
3699	
3700	MONTJOY	They call it Agincourt.
3701	
3702	KING HENRY V	Then call we this the field of Agincourt,
3703	Fought on the day of Crispin Crispianus.
3704	
3705	FLUELLEN	Your grandfather of famous memory, an't please your
3706	majesty, and your great-uncle Edward the Plack
3707	Prince of Wales, as I have read in the chronicles,
3708	fought a most prave pattle here in France.
3709	
3710	KING HENRY V	They did, Fluellen.
3711	
3712	FLUELLEN	Your majesty says very true: if your majesties is
3713	remembered of it, the Welshmen did good service in a
3714	garden where leeks did grow, wearing leeks in their
3715	Monmouth caps; which, your majesty know, to this
3716	hour is an honourable badge of the service; and I do
3717	believe your majesty takes no scorn to wear the leek
3718	upon Saint Tavy's day.
3719	
3720	KING HENRY V	I wear it for a memorable honour;
3721	For I am Welsh, you know, good countryman.
3722	
3723	FLUELLEN	All the water in Wye cannot wash your majesty's
3724	Welsh plood out of your pody, I can tell you that:
3725	God pless it and preserve it, as long as it pleases
3726	his grace, and his majesty too!
3727	
3728	KING HENRY V	Thanks, good my countryman.
3729	
3730	FLUELLEN	By Jeshu, I am your majesty's countryman, I care not
3731	who know it; I will confess it to all the 'orld: I
3732	need not to be ashamed of your majesty, praised be
3733	God, so long as your majesty is an honest man.
3734	
3735	KING HENRY V	God keep me so! Our heralds go with him:
3736	Bring me just notice of the numbers dead
3737	On both our parts. Call yonder fellow hither.
3738	
3739	[Points to WILLIAMS. Exeunt Heralds with Montjoy]
3740	
3741	EXETER	Soldier, you must come to the king.
3742	
3743	KING HENRY V	Soldier, why wearest thou that glove in thy cap?
3744	
3745	WILLIAMS	An't please your majesty, 'tis the gage of one that
3746	I should fight withal, if he be alive.
3747	
3748	KING HENRY V	An Englishman?
3749	
3750	WILLIAMS	An't please your majesty, a rascal that swaggered
3751	with me last night; who, if alive and ever dare to
3752	challenge this glove, I have sworn to take him a box
3753	o' th' ear: or if I can see my glove in his cap,
3754	which he swore, as he was a soldier, he would wear
3755	if alive, I will strike it out soundly.
3756	
3757	KING HENRY V	What think you, Captain Fluellen? is it fit this
3758	soldier keep his oath?
3759	
3760	FLUELLEN	He is a craven and a villain else, an't please your
3761	majesty, in my conscience.
3762	
3763	KING HENRY V	It may be his enemy is a gentleman of great sort,
3764	quite from the answer of his degree.
3765	
3766	FLUELLEN	Though he be as good a gentleman as the devil is, as
3767	Lucifer and Belzebub himself, it is necessary, look
3768	your grace, that he keep his vow and his oath: if
3769	he be perjured, see you now, his reputation is as
3770	arrant a villain and a Jacksauce, as ever his black
3771	shoe trod upon God's ground and his earth, in my
3772	conscience, la!
3773	
3774	KING HENRY V	Then keep thy vow, sirrah, when thou meetest the fellow.
3775	
3776	WILLIAMS	So I will, my liege, as I live.
3777	
3778	KING HENRY V	Who servest thou under?
3779	
3780	WILLIAMS	Under Captain Gower, my liege.
3781	
3782	FLUELLEN	Gower is a good captain, and is good knowledge and
3783	literatured in the wars.
3784	
3785	KING HENRY V	Call him hither to me, soldier.
3786	
3787	WILLIAMS	I will, my liege.
3788	
3789	[Exit]
3790	
3791	KING HENRY V	Here, Fluellen; wear thou this favour for me and
3792	stick it in thy cap: when Alencon and myself were
3793	down together, I plucked this glove from his helm:
3794	if any man challenge this, he is a friend to
3795	Alencon, and an enemy to our person; if thou
3796	encounter any such, apprehend him, an thou dost me love.
3797	
3798	FLUELLEN	Your grace doo's me as great honours as can be
3799	desired in the hearts of his subjects: I would fain
3800	see the man, that has but two legs, that shall find
3801	himself aggrieved at this glove; that is all; but I
3802	would fain see it once, an please God of his grace
3803	that I might see.
3804	
3805	KING HENRY V	Knowest thou Gower?
3806	
3807	FLUELLEN	He is my dear friend, an please you.
3808	
3809	KING HENRY V	Pray thee, go seek him, and bring him to my tent.
3810	
3811	FLUELLEN	I will fetch him.
3812	
3813	[Exit]
3814	
3815	KING HENRY V	My Lord of Warwick, and my brother Gloucester,
3816	Follow Fluellen closely at the heels:
3817	The glove which I have given him for a favour
3818	May haply purchase him a box o' th' ear;
3819	It is the soldier's; I by bargain should
3820	Wear it myself. Follow, good cousin Warwick:
3821	If that the soldier strike him, as I judge
3822	By his blunt bearing he will keep his word,
3823	Some sudden mischief may arise of it;
3824	For I do know Fluellen valiant
3825	And, touched with choler, hot as gunpowder,
3826	And quickly will return an injury:
3827	Follow and see there be no harm between them.
3828	Go you with me, uncle of Exeter.

3843	
3844	
3845	[Enter GOWER and WILLIAMS]
3846	
3847	WILLIAMS	I warrant it is to knight you, captain.
3848	
3849	[Enter FLUELLEN]
3850	
3851	FLUELLEN	God's will and his pleasure, captain, I beseech you
3852	now, come apace to the king: there is more good
3853	toward you peradventure than is in your knowledge to dream of.
3854	
3855	WILLIAMS	Sir, know you this glove?
3856	
3857	FLUELLEN	Know the glove! I know the glove is glove.
3858	
3859	WILLIAMS	I know this; and thus I challenge it.
3860	
3861	[Strikes him]
3862	
3863	FLUELLEN	'Sblood! an arrant traitor as any is in the
3864	universal world, or in France, or in England!
3865	
3866	GOWER	How now, sir! you villain!
3867	
3868	WILLIAMS	Do you think I'll be forsworn?
3869	
3870	FLUELLEN	Stand away, Captain Gower; I will give treason his
3871	payment into ploughs, I warrant you.
3872	
3873	WILLIAMS	I am no traitor.
3874	
3875	FLUELLEN	That's a lie in thy throat. I charge you in his
3876	majesty's name, apprehend him: he's a friend of the
3877	Duke Alencon's.
3878	
3879	[Enter WARWICK and GLOUCESTER]
3880	
3881	WARWICK	How now, how now! what's the matter?
3882	
3883	FLUELLEN	My Lord of Warwick, here is--praised be God for it!
3884	--a most contagious treason come to light, look
3885	you, as you shall desire in a summer's day. Here is
3886	his majesty.
3887	
3888	[Enter KING HENRY and EXETER]
3889	
3890	KING HENRY V	How now! what's the matter?
3891	
3892	FLUELLEN	My liege, here is a villain and a traitor, that,
3893	look your grace, has struck the glove which your
3894	majesty is take out of the helmet of Alencon.
3895	
3896	WILLIAMS	My liege, this was my glove; here is the fellow of
3897	it; and he that I gave it to in change promised to
3898	wear it in his cap: I promised to strike him, if he
3899	did: I met this man with my glove in his cap, and I
3900	have been as good as my word.
3901	
3902	FLUELLEN	Your majesty hear now, saving your majesty's
3903	manhood, what an arrant, rascally, beggarly, lousy
3904	knave it is: I hope your majesty is pear me
3905	testimony and witness, and will avouchment, that
3906	this is the glove of Alencon, that your majesty is
3907	give me; in your conscience, now?
3908	
3909	KING HENRY V	Give me thy glove, soldier: look, here is the
3910	fellow of it.
3911	'Twas I, indeed, thou promised'st to strike;
3912	And thou hast given me most bitter terms.
3913	
3914	FLUELLEN	An please your majesty, let his neck answer for it,
3915	if there is any martial law in the world.
3916	
3917	KING HENRY V	How canst thou make me satisfaction?
3918	
3919	WILLIAMS	All offences, my lord, come from the heart: never
3920	came any from mine that might offend your majesty.
3921	
3922	KING HENRY V	It was ourself thou didst abuse.
3923	
3924	WILLIAMS	Your majesty came not like yourself: you appeared to
3925	me but as a common man; witness the night, your
3926	garments, your lowliness; and what your highness
3927	suffered under that shape, I beseech you take it for
3928	your own fault and not mine: for had you been as I
3929	took you for, I made no offence; therefore, I
3930	beseech your highness, pardon me.
3931	
3932	KING HENRY V	Here, uncle Exeter, fill this glove with crowns,
3933	And give it to this fellow. Keep it, fellow;
3934	And wear it for an honour in thy cap
3935	Till I do challenge it. Give him the crowns:
3936	And, captain, you must needs be friends with him.
3937	
3938	FLUELLEN	By this day and this light, the fellow has mettle
3939	enough in his belly. Hold, there is twelve pence
3940	for you; and I pray you to serve Got, and keep you
3941	out of prawls, and prabbles' and quarrels, and
3942	dissensions, and, I warrant you, it is the better for you.
3943	
3944	WILLIAMS	I will none of your money.
3945	
3946	FLUELLEN	It is with a good will; I can tell you, it will
3947	serve you to mend your shoes: come, wherefore should
3948	you be so pashful? your shoes is not so good: 'tis
3949	a good silling, I warrant you, or I will change it.
3950	
3951	[Enter an English Herald]
3952	
3953	KING HENRY V	Now, herald, are the dead number'd?
3954	
3955	Herald	Here is the number of the slaughter'd French.
3956	
3957	KING HENRY V	What prisoners of good sort are taken, uncle?
3958	
3959	EXETER	Charles Duke of Orleans, nephew to the king;
3960	John Duke of Bourbon, and Lord Bouciqualt:
3961	Of other lords and barons, knights and squires,
3962	Full fifteen hundred, besides common men.
3963	
3964	KING HENRY V	This note doth tell me of ten thousand French
3965	That in the field lie slain: of princes, in this number,
3966	And nobles bearing banners, there lie dead
3967	One hundred twenty six: added to these,
3968	Of knights, esquires, and gallant gentlemen,
3969	Eight thousand and four hundred; of the which,
3970	Five hundred were but yesterday dubb'd knights:
3971	So that, in these ten thousand they have lost,
3972	There are but sixteen hundred mercenaries;
3973	The rest are princes, barons, lords, knights, squires,
3974	And gentlemen of blood and quality.
3975	The names of those their nobles that lie dead:
3976	Charles Delabreth, high constable of France;
3977	Jaques of Chatillon, admiral of France;
3978	The master of the cross-bows, Lord Rambures;
3979	Great Master of France, the brave Sir Guichard Dolphin,
3980	John Duke of Alencon, Anthony Duke of Brabant,
3981	The brother of the Duke of Burgundy,
3982	And Edward Duke of Bar: of lusty earls,
3983	Grandpre and Roussi, Fauconberg and Foix,
3984	Beaumont and Marle, Vaudemont and Lestrale.
3985	Here was a royal fellowship of death!
3986	Where is the number of our English dead?
3987	
3988	[Herald shews him another paper]
3989	
3990	Edward the Duke of York, the Earl of Suffolk,
3991	Sir Richard Ketly, Davy Gam, esquire:
3992	None else of name; and of all other men
3993	But five and twenty. O God, thy arm was here;
3994	And not to us, but to thy arm alone,
3995	Ascribe we all! When, without stratagem,
3996	But in plain shock and even play of battle,
3997	Was ever known so great and little loss
3998	On one part and on the other? Take it, God,
3999	For it is none but thine!
4000	
4001	EXETER	'Tis wonderful!
4002	
4003	KING HENRY V	Come, go we in procession to the village.
4004	And be it death proclaimed through our host
4005	To boast of this or take the praise from God
4006	Which is his only.
4007	
4008	FLUELLEN	Is it not lawful, an please your majesty, to tell
4009	how many is killed?
4010	
4011	KING HENRY V	Yes, captain; but with this acknowledgement,
4012	That God fought for us.
4013	
4014	FLUELLEN	Yes, my conscience, he did us great good.
4015	
4016	KING HENRY V	Do we all holy rites;
4017	Let there be sung 'Non nobis' and 'Te Deum;'
4018	The dead with charity enclosed in clay:
4019	And then to Calais; and to England then:
4020	Where ne'er from France arrived more happy men.

4033	PROLOGUE.
4034	
4035	
4036	[Enter Chorus]
4037	
4038	Chorus	Vouchsafe to those that have not read the story,
4039	That I may prompt them: and of such as have,
4040	I humbly pray them to admit the excuse
4041	Of time, of numbers and due course of things,
4042	Which cannot in their huge and proper life
4043	Be here presented. Now we bear the king
4044	Toward Calais: grant him there; there seen,
4045	Heave him away upon your winged thoughts
4046	Athwart the sea. Behold, the English beach
4047	Pales in the flood with men, with wives and boys,
4048	Whose shouts and claps out-voice the deep mouth'd sea,
4049	Which like a mighty whiffler 'fore the king
4050	Seems to prepare his way: so let him land,
4051	And solemnly see him set on to London.
4052	So swift a pace hath thought that even now
4053	You may imagine him upon Blackheath;
4054	Where that his lords desire him to have borne
4055	His bruised helmet and his bended sword
4056	Before him through the city: he forbids it,
4057	Being free from vainness and self-glorious pride;
4058	Giving full trophy, signal and ostent
4059	Quite from himself to God. But now behold,
4060	In the quick forge and working-house of thought,
4061	How London doth pour out her citizens!
4062	The mayor and all his brethren in best sort,
4063	Like to the senators of the antique Rome,
4064	With the plebeians swarming at their heels,
4065	Go forth and fetch their conquering Caesar in:
4066	As, by a lower but loving likelihood,
4067	Were now the general of our gracious empress,
4068	As in good time he may, from Ireland coming,
4069	Bringing rebellion broached on his sword,
4070	How many would the peaceful city quit,
4071	To welcome him! much more, and much more cause,
4072	Did they this Harry. Now in London place him;
4073	As yet the lamentation of the French
4074	Invites the King of England's stay at home;
4075	The emperor's coming in behalf of France,
4076	To order peace between them; and omit
4077	All the occurrences, whatever chanced,
4078	Till Harry's back-return again to France:
4079	There must we bring him; and myself have play'd
4080	The interim, by remembering you 'tis past.
4081	Then brook abridgment, and your eyes advance,
4082	After your thoughts, straight back again to France.

4100	
4101	GOWER	Nay, that's right; but why wear you your leek today?
4102	Saint Davy's day is past.
4103	
4104	FLUELLEN	There is occasions and causes why and wherefore in
4105	all things: I will tell you, asse my friend,
4106	Captain Gower: the rascally, scald, beggarly,
4107	lousy, pragging knave, Pistol, which you and
4108	yourself and all the world know to be no petter
4109	than a fellow, look you now, of no merits, he is
4110	come to me and prings me pread and salt yesterday,
4111	look you, and bid me eat my leek: it was in place
4112	where I could not breed no contention with him; but
4113	I will be so bold as to wear it in my cap till I see
4114	him once again, and then I will tell him a little
4115	piece of my desires.
4116	
4117	[Enter PISTOL]
4118	
4119	GOWER	Why, here he comes, swelling like a turkey-cock.
4120	
4121	FLUELLEN	'Tis no matter for his swellings nor his
4122	turkey-cocks. God pless you, Aunchient Pistol! you
4123	scurvy, lousy knave, God pless you!
4124	
4125	PISTOL	Ha! art thou bedlam? dost thou thirst, base Trojan,
4126	To have me fold up Parca's fatal web?
4127	Hence! I am qualmish at the smell of leek.
4128	
4129	FLUELLEN	I peseech you heartily, scurvy, lousy knave, at my
4130	desires, and my requests, and my petitions, to eat,
4131	look you, this leek: because, look you, you do not
4132	love it, nor your affections and your appetites and
4133	your digestions doo's not agree with it, I would
4134	desire you to eat it.
4135	
4136	PISTOL	Not for Cadwallader and all his goats.
4137	
4138	FLUELLEN	There is one goat for you.
4139	
4140	[Strikes him]
4141	
4142	Will you be so good, scauld knave, as eat it?
4143	
4144	PISTOL	Base Trojan, thou shalt die.
4145	
4146	FLUELLEN	You say very true, scauld knave, when God's will is:
4147	I will desire you to live in the mean time, and eat
4148	your victuals: come, there is sauce for it.
4149	
4150	[Strikes him]
4151	
4152	You called me yesterday mountain-squire; but I will
4153	make you to-day a squire of low degree. I pray you,
4154	fall to: if you can mock a leek, you can eat a leek.
4155	
4156	GOWER	Enough, captain: you have astonished him.
4157	
4158	FLUELLEN	I say, I will make him eat some part of my leek, or
4159	I will peat his pate four days. Bite, I pray you; it
4160	is good for your green wound and your ploody coxcomb.
4161	
4162	PISTOL	Must I bite?
4163	
4164	FLUELLEN	Yes, certainly, and out of doubt and out of question
4165	too, and ambiguities.
4166	
4167	PISTOL	By this leek, I will most horribly revenge: I eat
4168	and eat, I swear--
4169	
4170	FLUELLEN	Eat, I pray you: will you have some more sauce to
4171	your leek? there is not enough leek to swear by.
4172	
4173	PISTOL	Quiet thy cudgel; thou dost see I eat.
4174	
4175	FLUELLEN	Much good do you, scauld knave, heartily. Nay, pray
4176	you, throw none away; the skin is good for your
4177	broken coxcomb. When you take occasions to see leeks
4178	hereafter, I pray you, mock at 'em; that is all.
4179	
4180	PISTOL	Good.
4181	
4182	FLUELLEN	Ay, leeks is good: hold you, there is a groat to
4183	heal your pate.
4184	
4185	PISTOL	Me a groat!
4186	
4187	FLUELLEN	Yes, verily and in truth, you shall take it; or I
4188	have another leek in my pocket, which you shall eat.
4189	
4190	PISTOL	I take thy groat in earnest of revenge.
4191	
4192	FLUELLEN	If I owe you any thing, I will pay you in cudgels:
4193	you shall be a woodmonger, and buy nothing of me but
4194	cudgels. God b' wi' you, and keep you, and heal your pate.
4195	
4196	[Exit]
4197	
4198	PISTOL	All hell shall stir for this.
4199	
4200	GOWER	Go, go; you are a counterfeit cowardly knave. Will
4201	you mock at an ancient tradition, begun upon an
4202	honourable respect, and worn as a memorable trophy of
4203	predeceased valour and dare not avouch in your deeds
4204	any of your words? I have seen you gleeking and
4205	galling at this gentleman twice or thrice. You
4206	thought, because he could not speak English in the
4207	native garb, he could not therefore handle an
4208	English cudgel: you find it otherwise; and
4209	henceforth let a Welsh correction teach you a good
4210	English condition. Fare ye well.
4211	
4212	[Exit]
4213	
4214	PISTOL	Doth Fortune play the huswife with me now?
4215	News have I, that my Nell is dead i' the spital
4216	Of malady of France;
4217	And there my rendezvous is quite cut off.
4218	Old I do wax; and from my weary limbs
4219	Honour is cudgelled. Well, bawd I'll turn,
4220	And something lean to cutpurse of quick hand.
4221	To England will I steal, and there I'll steal:
4222	And patches will I get unto these cudgell'd scars,
4223	And swear I got them in the Gallia wars.
4224	
4225	[Exit]

4232	
4233	ACT V
4234	
4235	
4236	
4237	SCENE II	France. A royal palace.
4238	
4239	
4240	[Enter, at one door KING HENRY, EXETER, BEDFORD,
4241	GLOUCESTER, WARWICK, WESTMORELAND, and other Lords;
4242	at another, the FRENCH KING, QUEEN ISABEL, the
4243	PRINCESS KATHARINE, ALICE and other Ladies; the
4244	DUKE of BURGUNDY, and his train]
4245	
4246	KING HENRY V	Peace to this meeting, wherefore we are met!
4247	Unto our brother France, and to our sister,
4248	Health and fair time of day; joy and good wishes
4249	To our most fair and princely cousin Katharine;
4250	And, as a branch and member of this royalty,
4251	By whom this great assembly is contrived,
4252	We do salute you, Duke of Burgundy;
4253	And, princes French, and peers, health to you all!
4254	
4255	KING OF FRANCE	Right joyous are we to behold your face,
4256	Most worthy brother England; fairly met:
4257	So are you, princes English, every one.
4258	
4259	QUEEN ISABEL	So happy be the issue, brother England,
4260	Of this good day and of this gracious meeting,
4261	As we are now glad to behold your eyes;
4262	Your eyes, which hitherto have borne in them
4263	Against the French, that met them in their bent,
4264	The fatal balls of murdering basilisks:
4265	The venom of such looks, we fairly hope,
4266	Have lost their quality, and that this day
4267	Shall change all griefs and quarrels into love.
4268	
4269	KING HENRY V	To cry amen to that, thus we appear.
4270	
4271	QUEEN ISABEL	You English princes all, I do salute you.
4272	
4273	BURGUNDY	My duty to you both, on equal love,
4274	Great Kings of France and England! That I have labour'd,
4275	With all my wits, my pains and strong endeavours,
4276	To bring your most imperial majesties
4277	Unto this bar and royal interview,
4278	Your mightiness on both parts best can witness.
4279	Since then my office hath so far prevail'd
4280	That, face to face and royal eye to eye,
4281	You have congreeted, let it not disgrace me,
4282	If I demand, before this royal view,
4283	What rub or what impediment there is,
4284	Why that the naked, poor and mangled Peace,
4285	Dear nurse of arts and joyful births,
4286	Should not in this best garden of the world
4287	Our fertile France, put up her lovely visage?
4288	Alas, she hath from France too long been chased,
4289	And all her husbandry doth lie on heaps,
4290	Corrupting in its own fertility.
4291	Her vine, the merry cheerer of the heart,
4292	Unpruned dies; her hedges even-pleach'd,
4293	Like prisoners wildly overgrown with hair,
4294	Put forth disorder'd twigs; her fallow leas
4295	The darnel, hemlock and rank fumitory
4296	Doth root upon, while that the coulter rusts
4297	That should deracinate such savagery;
4298	The even mead, that erst brought sweetly forth
4299	The freckled cowslip, burnet and green clover,
4300	Wanting the scythe, all uncorrected, rank,
4301	Conceives by idleness and nothing teems
4302	But hateful docks, rough thistles, kecksies, burs,
4303	Losing both beauty and utility.
4304	And as our vineyards, fallows, meads and hedges,
4305	Defective in their natures, grow to wildness,
4306	Even so our houses and ourselves and children
4307	Have lost, or do not learn for want of time,
4308	The sciences that should become our country;
4309	But grow like savages,--as soldiers will
4310	That nothing do but meditate on blood,--
4311	To swearing and stern looks, diffused attire
4312	And every thing that seems unnatural.
4313	Which to reduce into our former favour
4314	You are assembled: and my speech entreats
4315	That I may know the let, why gentle Peace
4316	Should not expel these inconveniences
4317	And bless us with her former qualities.
4318	
4319	KING HENRY V	If, Duke of Burgundy, you would the peace,
4320	Whose want gives growth to the imperfections
4321	Which you have cited, you must buy that peace
4322	With full accord to all our just demands;
4323	Whose tenors and particular effects
4324	You have enscheduled briefly in your hands.
4325	
4326	BURGUNDY	The king hath heard them; to the which as yet
4327	There is no answer made.
4328	
4329	KING HENRY V	Well then the peace,
4330	Which you before so urged, lies in his answer.
4331	
4332	KING OF FRANCE	I have but with a cursorary eye
4333	O'erglanced the articles: pleaseth your grace
4334	To appoint some of your council presently
4335	To sit with us once more, with better heed
4336	To re-survey them, we will suddenly
4337	Pass our accept and peremptory answer.
4338	
4339	KING HENRY V	Brother, we shall. Go, uncle Exeter,
4340	And brother Clarence, and you, brother Gloucester,
4341	Warwick and Huntingdon, go with the king;
4342	And take with you free power to ratify,
4343	Augment, or alter, as your wisdoms best
4344	Shall see advantageable for our dignity,
4345	Any thing in or out of our demands,
4346	And we'll consign thereto. Will you, fair sister,
4347	Go with the princes, or stay here with us?
4348	
4349	QUEEN ISABEL	Our gracious brother, I will go with them:
4350	Haply a woman's voice may do some good,
4351	When articles too nicely urged be stood on.
4352	
4353	KING HENRY V	Yet leave our cousin Katharine here with us:
4354	She is our capital demand, comprised
4355	Within the fore-rank of our articles.
4356	
4357	QUEEN ISABEL	She hath good leave.
4358	
4359	[Exeunt all except HENRY, KATHARINE, and ALICE]
4360	
4361	KING HENRY V	Fair Katharine, and most fair,
4362	Will you vouchsafe to teach a soldier terms
4363	Such as will enter at a lady's ear
4364	And plead his love-suit to her gentle heart?
4365	
4366	KATHARINE	Your majesty shall mock at me; I cannot speak your England.
4367	
4368	KING HENRY V	O fair Katharine, if you will love me soundly with
4369	your French heart, I will be glad to hear you
4370	confess it brokenly with your English tongue. Do
4371	you like me, Kate?
4372	
4373	KATHARINE	Pardonnez-moi, I cannot tell vat is 'like me.'
4374	
4375	KING HENRY V	An angel is like you, Kate, and you are like an angel.
4376	
4377	KATHARINE	Que dit-il? que je suis semblable a les anges?
4378	
4379	ALICE	Oui, vraiment, sauf votre grace, ainsi dit-il.
4380	
4381	KING HENRY V	I said so, dear Katharine; and I must not blush to
4382	affirm it.
4383	
4384	KATHARINE	O bon Dieu! les langues des hommes sont pleines de
4385	tromperies.
4386	
4387	KING HENRY V	What says she, fair one? that the tongues of men
4388	are full of deceits?
4389	
4390	ALICE	Oui, dat de tongues of de mans is be full of
4391	deceits: dat is de princess.
4392	
4393	KING HENRY V	The princess is the better Englishwoman. I' faith,
4394	Kate, my wooing is fit for thy understanding: I am
4395	glad thou canst speak no better English; for, if
4396	thou couldst, thou wouldst find me such a plain king
4397	that thou wouldst think I had sold my farm to buy my
4398	crown. I know no ways to mince it in love, but
4399	directly to say 'I love you:' then if you urge me
4400	farther than to say 'do you in faith?' I wear out
4401	my suit. Give me your answer; i' faith, do: and so
4402	clap hands and a bargain: how say you, lady?
4403	
4404	KATHARINE	Sauf votre honneur, me understand vell.
4405	
4406	KING HENRY V	Marry, if you would put me to verses or to dance for
4407	your sake, Kate, why you undid me: for the one, I
4408	have neither words nor measure, and for the other, I
4409	have no strength in measure, yet a reasonable
4410	measure in strength. If I could win a lady at
4411	leap-frog, or by vaulting into my saddle with my
4412	armour on my back, under the correction of bragging
4413	be it spoken. I should quickly leap into a wife.
4414	Or if I might buffet for my love, or bound my horse
4415	for her favours, I could lay on like a butcher and
4416	sit like a jack-an-apes, never off. But, before God,
4417	Kate, I cannot look greenly nor gasp out my
4418	eloquence, nor I have no cunning in protestation;
4419	only downright oaths, which I never use till urged,
4420	nor never break for urging. If thou canst love a
4421	fellow of this temper, Kate, whose face is not worth
4422	sun-burning, that never looks in his glass for love
4423	of any thing he sees there, let thine eye be thy
4424	cook. I speak to thee plain soldier: If thou canst
4425	love me for this, take me: if not, to say to thee
4426	that I shall die, is true; but for thy love, by the
4427	Lord, no; yet I love thee too. And while thou
4428	livest, dear Kate, take a fellow of plain and
4429	uncoined constancy; for he perforce must do thee
4430	right, because he hath not the gift to woo in other
4431	places: for these fellows of infinite tongue, that
4432	can rhyme themselves into ladies' favours, they do
4433	always reason themselves out again. What! a
4434	speaker is but a prater; a rhyme is but a ballad. A
4435	good leg will fall; a straight back will stoop; a
4436	black beard will turn white; a curled pate will grow
4437	bald; a fair face will wither; a full eye will wax
4438	hollow: but a good heart, Kate, is the sun and the
4439	moon; or, rather, the sun, and not the moon; for it
4440	shines bright and never changes, but keeps his
4441	course truly. If thou would have such a one, take
4442	me; and take me, take a soldier; take a soldier,
4443	take a king. And what sayest thou then to my love?
4444	speak, my fair, and fairly, I pray thee.
4445	
4446	KATHARINE	Is it possible dat I sould love de enemy of France?
4447	
4448	KING HENRY V	No; it is not possible you should love the enemy of
4449	France, Kate: but, in loving me, you should love
4450	the friend of France; for I love France so well that
4451	I will not part with a village of it; I will have it
4452	all mine: and, Kate, when France is mine and I am
4453	yours, then yours is France and you are mine.
4454	
4455	KATHARINE	I cannot tell vat is dat.
4456	
4457	KING HENRY V	No, Kate? I will tell thee in French; which I am
4458	sure will hang upon my tongue like a new-married
4459	wife about her husband's neck, hardly to be shook
4460	off. Je quand sur le possession de France, et quand
4461	vous avez le possession de moi,--let me see, what
4462	then? Saint Denis be my speed!--donc votre est
4463	France et vous etes mienne. It is as easy for me,
4464	Kate, to conquer the kingdom as to speak so much
4465	more French: I shall never move thee in French,
4466	unless it be to laugh at me.
4467	
4468	KATHARINE	Sauf votre honneur, le Francois que vous parlez, il
4469	est meilleur que l'Anglois lequel je parle.
4470	
4471	KING HENRY V	No, faith, is't not, Kate: but thy speaking of my
4472	tongue, and I thine, most truly-falsely, must needs
4473	be granted to be much at one. But, Kate, dost thou
4474	understand thus much English, canst thou love me?
4475	
4476	KATHARINE	I cannot tell.
4477	
4478	KING HENRY V	Can any of your neighbours tell, Kate? I'll ask
4479	them. Come, I know thou lovest me: and at night,
4480	when you come into your closet, you'll question this
4481	gentlewoman about me; and I know, Kate, you will to
4482	her dispraise those parts in me that you love with
4483	your heart: but, good Kate, mock me mercifully; the
4484	rather, gentle princess, because I love thee
4485	cruelly. If ever thou beest mine, Kate, as I have a
4486	saving faith within me tells me thou shalt, I get
4487	thee with scambling, and thou must therefore needs
4488	prove a good soldier-breeder: shall not thou and I,
4489	between Saint Denis and Saint George, compound a
4490	boy, half French, half English, that shall go to
4491	Constantinople and take the Turk by the beard?
4492	shall we not? what sayest thou, my fair
4493	flower-de-luce?
4494	
4495	KATHARINE	I do not know dat
4496	
4497	KING HENRY V	No; 'tis hereafter to know, but now to promise: do
4498	but now promise, Kate, you will endeavour for your
4499	French part of such a boy; and for my English moiety
4500	take the word of a king and a bachelor. How answer
4501	you, la plus belle Katharine du monde, mon tres cher
4502	et devin deesse?
4503	
4504	KATHARINE	Your majestee ave fausse French enough to deceive de
4505	most sage demoiselle dat is en France.
4506	
4507	KING HENRY V	Now, fie upon my false French! By mine honour, in
4508	true English, I love thee, Kate: by which honour I
4509	dare not swear thou lovest me; yet my blood begins to
4510	flatter me that thou dost, notwithstanding the poor
4511	and untempering effect of my visage. Now, beshrew
4512	my father's ambition! he was thinking of civil wars
4513	when he got me: therefore was I created with a
4514	stubborn outside, with an aspect of iron, that, when
4515	I come to woo ladies, I fright them. But, in faith,
4516	Kate, the elder I wax, the better I shall appear:
4517	my comfort is, that old age, that ill layer up of
4518	beauty, can do no more, spoil upon my face: thou
4519	hast me, if thou hast me, at the worst; and thou
4520	shalt wear me, if thou wear me, better and better:
4521	and therefore tell me, most fair Katharine, will you
4522	have me? Put off your maiden blushes; avouch the
4523	thoughts of your heart with the looks of an empress;
4524	take me by the hand, and say 'Harry of England I am
4525	thine:' which word thou shalt no sooner bless mine
4526	ear withal, but I will tell thee aloud 'England is
4527	thine, Ireland is thine, France is thine, and Harry
4528	Plantagenet is thine;' who though I speak it before
4529	his face, if he be not fellow with the best king,
4530	thou shalt find the best king of good fellows.
4531	Come, your answer in broken music; for thy voice is
4532	music and thy English broken; therefore, queen of
4533	all, Katharine, break thy mind to me in broken
4534	English; wilt thou have me?
4535	
4536	KATHARINE	Dat is as it sall please de roi mon pere.
4537	
4538	KING HENRY V	Nay, it will please him well, Kate it shall please
4539	him, Kate.
4540	
4541	KATHARINE	Den it sall also content me.
4542	
4543	KING HENRY V	Upon that I kiss your hand, and I call you my queen.
4544	
4545	KATHARINE	Laissez, mon seigneur, laissez, laissez: ma foi, je
4546	ne veux point que vous abaissiez votre grandeur en
4547	baisant la main d'une de votre seigeurie indigne
4548	serviteur; excusez-moi, je vous supplie, mon
4549	tres-puissant seigneur.
4550	
4551	KING HENRY V	Then I will kiss your lips, Kate.
4552	
4553	KATHARINE	Les dames et demoiselles pour etre baisees devant
4554	leur noces, il n'est pas la coutume de France.
4555	
4556	KING HENRY V	Madam my interpreter, what says she?
4557	
4558	ALICE	Dat it is not be de fashion pour les ladies of
4559	France,--I cannot tell vat is baiser en Anglish.
4560	
4561	KING HENRY V	To kiss.
4562	
4563	ALICE	Your majesty entendre bettre que moi.
4564	
4565	KING HENRY V	It is not a fashion for the maids in France to kiss
4566	before they are married, would she say?
4567	
4568	ALICE	Oui, vraiment.
4569	
4570	KING HENRY V	O Kate, nice customs curtsy to great kings. Dear
4571	Kate, you and I cannot be confined within the weak
4572	list of a country's fashion: we are the makers of
4573	manners, Kate; and the liberty that follows our
4574	places stops the mouth of all find-faults; as I will
4575	do yours, for upholding the nice fashion of your
4576	country in denying me a kiss: therefore, patiently
4577	and yielding.
4578	
4579	[Kissing her]
4580	
4581	You have witchcraft in your lips, Kate: there is
4582	more eloquence in a sugar touch of them than in the
4583	tongues of the French council; and they should
4584	sooner persuade Harry of England than a general
4585	petition of monarchs. Here comes your father.
4586	
4587	[Re-enter the FRENCH KING and his QUEEN, BURGUNDY,
4588	and other Lords]
4589	
4590	BURGUNDY	God save your majesty! my royal cousin, teach you
4591	our princess English?
4592	
4593	KING HENRY V	I would have her learn, my fair cousin, how
4594	perfectly I love her; and that is good English.
4595	
4596	BURGUNDY	Is she not apt?
4597	
4598	KING HENRY V	Our tongue is rough, coz, and my condition is not
4599	smooth; so that, having neither the voice nor the
4600	heart of flattery about me, I cannot so conjure up
4601	the spirit of love in her, that he will appear in
4602	his true likeness.
4603	
4604	BURGUNDY	Pardon the frankness of my mirth, if I answer you
4605	for that. If you would conjure in her, you must
4606	make a circle; if conjure up love in her in his true
4607	likeness, he must appear naked and blind. Can you
4608	blame her then, being a maid yet rosed over with the
4609	virgin crimson of modesty, if she deny the
4610	appearance of a naked blind boy in her naked seeing
4611	self? It were, my lord, a hard condition for a maid
4612	to consign to.
4613	
4614	KING HENRY V	Yet they do wink and yield, as love is blind and enforces.
4615	
4616	BURGUNDY	They are then excused, my lord, when they see not
4617	what they do.
4618	
4619	KING HENRY V	Then, good my lord, teach your cousin to consent winking.
4620	
4621	BURGUNDY	I will wink on her to consent, my lord, if you will
4622	teach her to know my meaning: for maids, well
4623	summered and warm kept, are like flies at
4624	Bartholomew-tide, blind, though they have their
4625	eyes; and then they will endure handling, which
4626	before would not abide looking on.
4627	
4628	KING HENRY V	This moral ties me over to time and a hot summer;
4629	and so I shall catch the fly, your cousin, in the
4630	latter end and she must be blind too.
4631	
4632	BURGUNDY	As love is, my lord, before it loves.
4633	
4634	KING HENRY V	It is so: and you may, some of you, thank love for
4635	my blindness, who cannot see many a fair French city
4636	for one fair French maid that stands in my way.
4637	
4638	FRENCH KING	Yes, my lord, you see them perspectively, the cities
4639	turned into a maid; for they are all girdled with
4640	maiden walls that war hath never entered.
4641	
4642	KING HENRY V	Shall Kate be my wife?
4643	
4644	FRENCH KING	So please you.
4645	
4646	KING HENRY V	I am content; so the maiden cities you talk of may
4647	wait on her: so the maid that stood in the way for
4648	my wish shall show me the way to my will.
4649	
4650	FRENCH KING	We have consented to all terms of reason.
4651	
4652	KING HENRY V	Is't so, my lords of England?
4653	
4654	WESTMORELAND	The king hath granted every article:
4655	His daughter first, and then in sequel all,
4656	According to their firm proposed natures.
4657	
4658	EXETER	Only he hath not yet subscribed this:
4659	Where your majesty demands, that the King of France,
4660	having any occasion to write for matter of grant,
4661	shall name your highness in this form and with this
4662	addition in French, Notre trescher fils Henri, Roi
4663	d'Angleterre, Heritier de France; and thus in
4664	Latin, Praeclarissimus filius noster Henricus, Rex
4665	Angliae, et Haeres Franciae.
4666	
4667	FRENCH KING	Nor this I have not, brother, so denied,
4668	But your request shall make me let it pass.
4669	
4670	KING HENRY V	I pray you then, in love and dear alliance,
4671	Let that one article rank with the rest;
4672	And thereupon give me your daughter.
4673	
4674	FRENCH KING	Take her, fair son, and from her blood raise up
4675	Issue to me; that the contending kingdoms
4676	Of France and England, whose very shores look pale
4677	With envy of each other's happiness,
4678	May cease their hatred, and this dear conjunction
4679	Plant neighbourhood and Christian-like accord
4680	In their sweet bosoms, that never war advance
4681	His bleeding sword 'twixt England and fair France.
4682	
4683	ALL	Amen!
4684	
4685	KING HENRY V	Now, welcome, Kate: and bear me witness all,
4686	That here I kiss her as my sovereign queen.
4687	
4688	[Flourish]
4689	
4690	QUEEN ISABEL	God, the best maker of all marriages,
4691	Combine your hearts in one, your realms in one!
4692	As man and wife, being two, are one in love,
4693	So be there 'twixt your kingdoms such a spousal,
4694	That never may ill office, or fell jealousy,
4695	Which troubles oft the bed of blessed marriage,
4696	Thrust in between the paction of these kingdoms,
4697	To make divorce of their incorporate league;
4698	That English may as French, French Englishmen,
4699	Receive each other. God speak this Amen!
4700	
4701	ALL	Amen!
4702	
4703	KING HENRY V	Prepare we for our marriage--on which day,
4704	My Lord of Burgundy, we'll take your oath,
4705	And all the peers', for surety of our leagues.
4706	Then shall I swear to Kate, and you to me;
4707	And may our oaths well kept and prosperous be!
4708

4716	EPILOGUE

4718	
4719	[Enter Chorus]
4720	
4721	Chorus	Thus far, with rough and all-unable pen,
4722	Our bending author hath pursued the story,
4723	In little room confining mighty men,
4724	Mangling by starts the full course of their glory.
4725	Small time, but in that small most greatly lived
4726	This star of England: Fortune made his sword;
4727	By which the world's best garden be achieved,
4728	And of it left his son imperial lord.
4729	Henry the Sixth, in infant bands crown'd King
4730	Of France and England, did this king succeed;
4731	Whose state so many had the managing,
4732	That they lost France and made his England bleed:
4733	Which oft our stage hath shown; and, for their sake,
4734	In your fair minds let this acceptance take.

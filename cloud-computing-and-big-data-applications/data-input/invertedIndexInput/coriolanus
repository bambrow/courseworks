94	ACT I

97	
98	SCENE I	Rome. A street.
99	
100	
101	[Enter a company of mutinous Citizens, with staves,
102	clubs, and other weapons]
103	
104	First Citizen	Before we proceed any further, hear me speak.
105	
106	All	Speak, speak.
107	
108	First Citizen	You are all resolved rather to die than to famish?
109	
110	All	Resolved. resolved.
111	
112	First Citizen	First, you know Caius Marcius is chief enemy to the people.
113	
114	All	We know't, we know't.
115	
116	First Citizen	Let us kill him, and we'll have corn at our own price.
117	Is't a verdict?
118	
119	All	No more talking on't; let it be done: away, away!
120	
121	Second Citizen	One word, good citizens.
122	
123	First Citizen	We are accounted poor citizens, the patricians good.
124	What authority surfeits on would relieve us: if they
125	would yield us but the superfluity, while it were
126	wholesome, we might guess they relieved us humanely;
127	but they think we are too dear: the leanness that
128	afflicts us, the object of our misery, is as an
129	inventory to particularise their abundance; our
130	sufferance is a gain to them Let us revenge this with
131	our pikes, ere we become rakes: for the gods know I
132	speak this in hunger for bread, not in thirst for revenge.
133	
134	Second Citizen	Would you proceed especially against Caius Marcius?
135	
136	All	Against him first: he's a very dog to the commonalty.
137	
138	Second Citizen	Consider you what services he has done for his country?
139	
140	First Citizen	Very well; and could be content to give him good
141	report fort, but that he pays himself with being proud.
142	
143	Second Citizen	Nay, but speak not maliciously.
144	
145	First Citizen	I say unto you, what he hath done famously, he did
146	it to that end: though soft-conscienced men can be
147	content to say it was for his country he did it to
148	please his mother and to be partly proud; which he
149	is, even till the altitude of his virtue.
150	
151	Second Citizen	What he cannot help in his nature, you account a
152	vice in him. You must in no way say he is covetous.
153	
154	First Citizen	If I must not, I need not be barren of accusations;
155	he hath faults, with surplus, to tire in repetition.
156	
157	[Shouts within]
158	
159	What shouts are these? The other side o' the city
160	is risen: why stay we prating here? to the Capitol!
161	
162	All	Come, come.
163	
164	First Citizen	Soft! who comes here?
165	
166	[Enter MENENIUS AGRIPPA]
167	
168	Second Citizen	Worthy Menenius Agrippa; one that hath always loved
169	the people.
170	
171	First Citizen	He's one honest enough: would all the rest were so!
172	
173	MENENIUS	What work's, my countrymen, in hand? where go you
174	With bats and clubs? The matter? speak, I pray you.
175	
176	First Citizen	Our business is not unknown to the senate; they have
177	had inkling this fortnight what we intend to do,
178	which now we'll show 'em in deeds. They say poor
179	suitors have strong breaths: they shall know we
180	have strong arms too.
181	
182	MENENIUS	Why, masters, my good friends, mine honest neighbours,
183	Will you undo yourselves?
184	
185	First Citizen	We cannot, sir, we are undone already.
186	
187	MENENIUS	I tell you, friends, most charitable care
188	Have the patricians of you. For your wants,
189	Your suffering in this dearth, you may as well
190	Strike at the heaven with your staves as lift them
191	Against the Roman state, whose course will on
192	The way it takes, cracking ten thousand curbs
193	Of more strong link asunder than can ever
194	Appear in your impediment. For the dearth,
195	The gods, not the patricians, make it, and
196	Your knees to them, not arms, must help. Alack,
197	You are transported by calamity
198	Thither where more attends you, and you slander
199	The helms o' the state, who care for you like fathers,
200	When you curse them as enemies.
201	
202	First Citizen	Care for us! True, indeed! They ne'er cared for us
203	yet: suffer us to famish, and their store-houses
204	crammed with grain; make edicts for usury, to
205	support usurers; repeal daily any wholesome act
206	established against the rich, and provide more
207	piercing statutes daily, to chain up and restrain
208	the poor. If the wars eat us not up, they will; and
209	there's all the love they bear us.
210	
211	MENENIUS	Either you must
212	Confess yourselves wondrous malicious,
213	Or be accused of folly. I shall tell you
214	A pretty tale: it may be you have heard it;
215	But, since it serves my purpose, I will venture
216	To stale 't a little more.
217	
218	First Citizen	Well, I'll hear it, sir: yet you must not think to
219	fob off our disgrace with a tale: but, an 't please
220	you, deliver.
221	
222	MENENIUS	There was a time when all the body's members
223	Rebell'd against the belly, thus accused it:
224	That only like a gulf it did remain
225	I' the midst o' the body, idle and unactive,
226	Still cupboarding the viand, never bearing
227	Like labour with the rest, where the other instruments
228	Did see and hear, devise, instruct, walk, feel,
229	And, mutually participate, did minister
230	Unto the appetite and affection common
231	Of the whole body. The belly answer'd--
232	
233	First Citizen	Well, sir, what answer made the belly?
234	
235	MENENIUS	Sir, I shall tell you. With a kind of smile,
236	Which ne'er came from the lungs, but even thus--
237	For, look you, I may make the belly smile
238	As well as speak--it tauntingly replied
239	To the discontented members, the mutinous parts
240	That envied his receipt; even so most fitly
241	As you malign our senators for that
242	They are not such as you.
243	
244	First Citizen	Your belly's answer? What!
245	The kingly-crowned head, the vigilant eye,
246	The counsellor heart, the arm our soldier,
247	Our steed the leg, the tongue our trumpeter.
248	With other muniments and petty helps
249	In this our fabric, if that they--
250	
251	MENENIUS	What then?
252	'Fore me, this fellow speaks! What then? what then?
253	
254	First Citizen	Should by the cormorant belly be restrain'd,
255	Who is the sink o' the body,--
256	
257	MENENIUS	Well, what then?
258	
259	First Citizen	The former agents, if they did complain,
260	What could the belly answer?
261	
262	MENENIUS	I will tell you
263	If you'll bestow a small--of what you have little--
264	Patience awhile, you'll hear the belly's answer.
265	
266	First Citizen	Ye're long about it.
267	
268	MENENIUS	Note me this, good friend;
269	Your most grave belly was deliberate,
270	Not rash like his accusers, and thus answer'd:
271	'True is it, my incorporate friends,' quoth he,
272	'That I receive the general food at first,
273	Which you do live upon; and fit it is,
274	Because I am the store-house and the shop
275	Of the whole body: but, if you do remember,
276	I send it through the rivers of your blood,
277	Even to the court, the heart, to the seat o' the brain;
278	And, through the cranks and offices of man,
279	The strongest nerves and small inferior veins
280	From me receive that natural competency
281	Whereby they live: and though that all at once,
282	You, my good friends,'--this says the belly, mark me,--
283	
284	First Citizen	Ay, sir; well, well.
285	
286	MENENIUS	'Though all at once cannot
287	See what I do deliver out to each,
288	Yet I can make my audit up, that all
289	From me do back receive the flour of all,
290	And leave me but the bran.' What say you to't?
291	
292	First Citizen	It was an answer: how apply you this?
293	
294	MENENIUS	The senators of Rome are this good belly,
295	And you the mutinous members; for examine
296	Their counsels and their cares, digest things rightly
297	Touching the weal o' the common, you shall find
298	No public benefit which you receive
299	But it proceeds or comes from them to you
300	And no way from yourselves. What do you think,
301	You, the great toe of this assembly?
302	
303	First Citizen	I the great toe! why the great toe?
304	
305	MENENIUS	For that, being one o' the lowest, basest, poorest,
306	Of this most wise rebellion, thou go'st foremost:
307	Thou rascal, that art worst in blood to run,
308	Lead'st first to win some vantage.
309	But make you ready your stiff bats and clubs:
310	Rome and her rats are at the point of battle;
311	The one side must have bale.
312	
313	[Enter CAIUS MARCIUS]
314	
315	Hail, noble Marcius!
316	
317	MARCIUS	Thanks. What's the matter, you dissentious rogues,
318	That, rubbing the poor itch of your opinion,
319	Make yourselves scabs?
320	
321	First Citizen	We have ever your good word.
322	
323	MARCIUS	He that will give good words to thee will flatter
324	Beneath abhorring. What would you have, you curs,
325	That like nor peace nor war? the one affrights you,
326	The other makes you proud. He that trusts to you,
327	Where he should find you lions, finds you hares;
328	Where foxes, geese: you are no surer, no,
329	Than is the coal of fire upon the ice,
330	Or hailstone in the sun. Your virtue is
331	To make him worthy whose offence subdues him
332	And curse that justice did it.
333	Who deserves greatness
334	Deserves your hate; and your affections are
335	A sick man's appetite, who desires most that
336	Which would increase his evil. He that depends
337	Upon your favours swims with fins of lead
338	And hews down oaks with rushes. Hang ye! Trust Ye?
339	With every minute you do change a mind,
340	And call him noble that was now your hate,
341	Him vile that was your garland. What's the matter,
342	That in these several places of the city
343	You cry against the noble senate, who,
344	Under the gods, keep you in awe, which else
345	Would feed on one another? What's their seeking?
346	
347	MENENIUS	For corn at their own rates; whereof, they say,
348	The city is well stored.
349	
350	MARCIUS	Hang 'em! They say!
351	They'll sit by the fire, and presume to know
352	What's done i' the Capitol; who's like to rise,
353	Who thrives and who declines; side factions
354	and give out
355	Conjectural marriages; making parties strong
356	And feebling such as stand not in their liking
357	Below their cobbled shoes. They say there's
358	grain enough!
359	Would the nobility lay aside their ruth,
360	And let me use my sword, I'll make a quarry
361	With thousands of these quarter'd slaves, as high
362	As I could pick my lance.
363	
364	MENENIUS	Nay, these are almost thoroughly persuaded;
365	For though abundantly they lack discretion,
366	Yet are they passing cowardly. But, I beseech you,
367	What says the other troop?
368	
369	MARCIUS	They are dissolved: hang 'em!
370	They said they were an-hungry; sigh'd forth proverbs,
371	That hunger broke stone walls, that dogs must eat,
372	That meat was made for mouths, that the gods sent not
373	Corn for the rich men only: with these shreds
374	They vented their complainings; which being answer'd,
375	And a petition granted them, a strange one--
376	To break the heart of generosity,
377	And make bold power look pale--they threw their caps
378	As they would hang them on the horns o' the moon,
379	Shouting their emulation.
380	
381	MENENIUS	What is granted them?
382	
383	MARCIUS	Five tribunes to defend their vulgar wisdoms,
384	Of their own choice: one's Junius Brutus,
385	Sicinius Velutus, and I know not--'Sdeath!
386	The rabble should have first unroof'd the city,
387	Ere so prevail'd with me: it will in time
388	Win upon power and throw forth greater themes
389	For insurrection's arguing.
390	
391	MENENIUS	This is strange.
392	
393	MARCIUS	Go, get you home, you fragments!
394	
395	[Enter a Messenger, hastily]
396	
397	Messenger	Where's Caius Marcius?
398	
399	MARCIUS	Here: what's the matter?
400	
401	Messenger	The news is, sir, the Volsces are in arms.
402	
403	MARCIUS	I am glad on 't: then we shall ha' means to vent
404	Our musty superfluity. See, our best elders.
405	
406	[Enter COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators;
407	JUNIUS BRUTUS and SICINIUS VELUTUS]
408	
409	First Senator	Marcius, 'tis true that you have lately told us;
410	The Volsces are in arms.
411	
412	MARCIUS	They have a leader,
413	Tullus Aufidius, that will put you to 't.
414	I sin in envying his nobility,
415	And were I any thing but what I am,
416	I would wish me only he.
417	
418	COMINIUS	You have fought together.
419	
420	MARCIUS	Were half to half the world by the ears and he.
421	Upon my party, I'ld revolt to make
422	Only my wars with him: he is a lion
423	That I am proud to hunt.
424	
425	First Senator	Then, worthy Marcius,
426	Attend upon Cominius to these wars.
427	
428	COMINIUS	It is your former promise.
429	
430	MARCIUS	Sir, it is;
431	And I am constant. Titus Lartius, thou
432	Shalt see me once more strike at Tullus' face.
433	What, art thou stiff? stand'st out?
434	
435	TITUS	No, Caius Marcius;
436	I'll lean upon one crutch and fight with t'other,
437	Ere stay behind this business.
438	
439	MENENIUS	O, true-bred!
440	
441	First Senator	Your company to the Capitol; where, I know,
442	Our greatest friends attend us.
443	
444	TITUS	[To COMINIUS]                Lead you on.
445	
446	[To MARCIUS]  Follow Cominius; we must follow you;
447	Right worthy you priority.
448	
449	COMINIUS	Noble Marcius!
450	
451	First Senator	[To the Citizens]  Hence to your homes; be gone!
452	
453	MARCIUS	Nay, let them follow:
454	The Volsces have much corn; take these rats thither
455	To gnaw their garners. Worshipful mutiners,
456	Your valour puts well forth: pray, follow.
457	
458	[Citizens steal away. Exeunt all but SICINIUS
459	and BRUTUS]
460	
461	SICINIUS	Was ever man so proud as is this Marcius?
462	
463	BRUTUS	He has no equal.
464	
465	SICINIUS	When we were chosen tribunes for the people,--
466	
467	BRUTUS	Mark'd you his lip and eyes?
468	
469	SICINIUS	Nay. but his taunts.
470	
471	BRUTUS	Being moved, he will not spare to gird the gods.
472	
473	SICINIUS	Be-mock the modest moon.
474	
475	BRUTUS	The present wars devour him: he is grown
476	Too proud to be so valiant.
477	
478	SICINIUS	Such a nature,
479	Tickled with good success, disdains the shadow
480	Which he treads on at noon: but I do wonder
481	His insolence can brook to be commanded
482	Under Cominius.
483	
484	BRUTUS	Fame, at the which he aims,
485	In whom already he's well graced, can not
486	Better be held nor more attain'd than by
487	A place below the first: for what miscarries
488	Shall be the general's fault, though he perform
489	To the utmost of a man, and giddy censure
490	Will then cry out of Marcius 'O if he
491	Had borne the business!'
492	
493	SICINIUS	Besides, if things go well,
494	Opinion that so sticks on Marcius shall
495	Of his demerits rob Cominius.
496	
497	BRUTUS	Come:
498	Half all Cominius' honours are to Marcius.
499	Though Marcius earned them not, and all his faults
500	To Marcius shall be honours, though indeed
501	In aught he merit not.
502	
503	SICINIUS	Let's hence, and hear
504	How the dispatch is made, and in what fashion,
505	More than his singularity, he goes
506	Upon this present action.
507	
508	BRUTUS	Lets along.

523	
524	
525	[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS and certain Senators]
526	
527	First Senator	So, your opinion is, Aufidius,
528	That they of Rome are entered in our counsels
529	And know how we proceed.
530	
531	AUFIDIUS	Is it not yours?
532	What ever have been thought on in this state,
533	That could be brought to bodily act ere Rome
534	Had circumvention? 'Tis not four days gone
535	Since I heard thence; these are the words: I think
536	I have the letter here; yes, here it is.
537	
538	[Reads]
539	
540	'They have press'd a power, but it is not known
541	Whether for east or west: the dearth is great;
542	The people mutinous; and it is rumour'd,
543	Cominius, Marcius your old enemy,
544	Who is of Rome worse hated than of you,
545	And Titus Lartius, a most valiant Roman,
546	These three lead on this preparation
547	Whither 'tis bent: most likely 'tis for you:
548	Consider of it.'
549	
550	First Senator	                  Our army's in the field
551	We never yet made doubt but Rome was ready
552	To answer us.
553	
554	AUFIDIUS	                  Nor did you think it folly
555	To keep your great pretences veil'd till when
556	They needs must show themselves; which
557	in the hatching,
558	It seem'd, appear'd to Rome. By the discovery.
559	We shall be shorten'd in our aim, which was
560	To take in many towns ere almost Rome
561	Should know we were afoot.
562	
563	Second Senator	Noble Aufidius,
564	Take your commission; hie you to your bands:
565	Let us alone to guard Corioli:
566	If they set down before 's, for the remove
567	Bring your army; but, I think, you'll find
568	They've not prepared for us.
569	
570	AUFIDIUS	O, doubt not that;
571	I speak from certainties. Nay, more,
572	Some parcels of their power are forth already,
573	And only hitherward. I leave your honours.
574	If we and Caius Marcius chance to meet,
575	'Tis sworn between us we shall ever strike
576	Till one can do no more.

600	SCENE III	Rome. A room in Marcius' house.
601	
602	
603	[Enter VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA	they set them down
604	on two low stools, and sew]
605	
606	VOLUMNIA	I pray you, daughter, sing; or express yourself in a
607	more comfortable sort: if my son were my husband, I
608	should freelier rejoice in that absence wherein he
609	won honour than in the embracements of his bed where
610	he would show most love. When yet he was but
611	tender-bodied and the only son of my womb, when
612	youth with comeliness plucked all gaze his way, when
613	for a day of kings' entreaties a mother should not
614	sell him an hour from her beholding, I, considering
615	how honour would become such a person. that it was
616	no better than picture-like to hang by the wall, if
617	renown made it not stir, was pleased to let him seek
618	danger where he was like to find fame. To a cruel
619	war I sent him; from whence he returned, his brows
620	bound with oak. I tell thee, daughter, I sprang not
621	more in joy at first hearing he was a man-child
622	than now in first seeing he had proved himself a
623	man.
624	
625	VIRGILIA	But had he died in the business, madam; how then?
626	
627	VOLUMNIA	Then his good report should have been my son; I
628	therein would have found issue. Hear me profess
629	sincerely: had I a dozen sons, each in my love
630	alike and none less dear than thine and my good
631	Marcius, I had rather had eleven die nobly for their
632	country than one voluptuously surfeit out of action.
633	
634	[Enter a Gentlewoman]
635	
636	Gentlewoman	Madam, the Lady Valeria is come to visit you.
637	
638	VIRGILIA	Beseech you, give me leave to retire myself.
639	
640	VOLUMNIA	Indeed, you shall not.
641	Methinks I hear hither your husband's drum,
642	See him pluck Aufidius down by the hair,
643	As children from a bear, the Volsces shunning him:
644	Methinks I see him stamp thus, and call thus:
645	'Come on, you cowards! you were got in fear,
646	Though you were born in Rome:' his bloody brow
647	With his mail'd hand then wiping, forth he goes,
648	Like to a harvest-man that's task'd to mow
649	Or all or lose his hire.
650	
651	VIRGILIA	His bloody brow! O Jupiter, no blood!
652	
653	VOLUMNIA	Away, you fool! it more becomes a man
654	Than gilt his trophy: the breasts of Hecuba,
655	When she did suckle Hector, look'd not lovelier
656	Than Hector's forehead when it spit forth blood
657	At Grecian sword, contemning. Tell Valeria,
658	We are fit to bid her welcome.
659	
660	[Exit Gentlewoman]
661	
662	VIRGILIA	Heavens bless my lord from fell Aufidius!
663	
664	VOLUMNIA	He'll beat Aufidius 'head below his knee
665	And tread upon his neck.
666	
667	[Enter VALERIA, with an Usher and Gentlewoman]
668	
669	VALERIA	My ladies both, good day to you.
670	
671	VOLUMNIA	Sweet madam.
672	
673	VIRGILIA	I am glad to see your ladyship.
674	
675	VALERIA	How do you both? you are manifest house-keepers.
676	What are you sewing here? A fine spot, in good
677	faith. How does your little son?
678	
679	VIRGILIA	I thank your ladyship; well, good madam.
680	
681	VOLUMNIA	He had rather see the swords, and hear a drum, than
682	look upon his school-master.
683	
684	VALERIA	O' my word, the father's son: I'll swear,'tis a
685	very pretty boy. O' my troth, I looked upon him o'
686	Wednesday half an hour together: has such a
687	confirmed countenance. I saw him run after a gilded
688	butterfly: and when he caught it, he let it go
689	again; and after it again; and over and over he
690	comes, and again; catched it again; or whether his
691	fall enraged him, or how 'twas, he did so set his
692	teeth and tear it; O, I warrant it, how he mammocked
693	it!
694	
695	VOLUMNIA	One on 's father's moods.
696	
697	VALERIA	Indeed, la, 'tis a noble child.
698	
699	VIRGILIA	A crack, madam.
700	
701	VALERIA	Come, lay aside your stitchery; I must have you play
702	the idle husewife with me this afternoon.
703	
704	VIRGILIA	No, good madam; I will not out of doors.
705	
706	VALERIA	Not out of doors!
707	
708	VOLUMNIA	She shall, she shall.
709	
710	VIRGILIA	Indeed, no, by your patience; I'll not over the
711	threshold till my lord return from the wars.
712	
713	VALERIA	Fie, you confine yourself most unreasonably: come,
714	you must go visit the good lady that lies in.
715	
716	VIRGILIA	I will wish her speedy strength, and visit her with
717	my prayers; but I cannot go thither.
718	
719	VOLUMNIA	Why, I pray you?
720	
721	VIRGILIA	'Tis not to save labour, nor that I want love.
722	
723	VALERIA	You would be another Penelope: yet, they say, all
724	the yarn she spun in Ulysses' absence did but fill
725	Ithaca full of moths. Come; I would your cambric
726	were sensible as your finger, that you might leave
727	pricking it for pity. Come, you shall go with us.
728	
729	VIRGILIA	No, good madam, pardon me; indeed, I will not forth.
730	
731	VALERIA	In truth, la, go with me; and I'll tell you
732	excellent news of your husband.
733	
734	VIRGILIA	O, good madam, there can be none yet.
735	
736	VALERIA	Verily, I do not jest with you; there came news from
737	him last night.
738	
739	VIRGILIA	Indeed, madam?
740	
741	VALERIA	In earnest, it's true; I heard a senator speak it.
742	Thus it is: the Volsces have an army forth; against
743	whom Cominius the general is gone, with one part of
744	our Roman power: your lord and Titus Lartius are set
745	down before their city Corioli; they nothing doubt
746	prevailing and to make it brief wars. This is true,
747	on mine honour; and so, I pray, go with us.
748	
749	VIRGILIA	Give me excuse, good madam; I will obey you in every
750	thing hereafter.
751	
752	VOLUMNIA	Let her alone, lady: as she is now, she will but
753	disease our better mirth.
754	
755	VALERIA	In troth, I think she would. Fare you well, then.
756	Come, good sweet lady. Prithee, Virgilia, turn thy
757	solemness out o' door. and go along with us.
758	
759	VIRGILIA	No, at a word, madam; indeed, I must not. I wish
760	you much mirth.
761	
762	VALERIA	Well, then, farewell.

780	LARTIUS, Captains and Soldiers. To them a
781	Messenger]
782	
783	MARCIUS	Yonder comes news. A wager they have met.
784	
785	LARTIUS	My horse to yours, no.
786	
787	MARCIUS	'Tis done.
788	
789	LARTIUS	Agreed.
790	
791	MARCIUS	Say, has our general met the enemy?
792	
793	Messenger	They lie in view; but have not spoke as yet.
794	
795	LARTIUS	So, the good horse is mine.
796	
797	MARCIUS	I'll buy him of you.
798	
799	LARTIUS	No, I'll nor sell nor give him: lend you him I will
800	For half a hundred years. Summon the town.
801	
802	MARCIUS	How far off lie these armies?
803	
804	Messenger	Within this mile and half.
805	
806	MARCIUS	Then shall we hear their 'larum, and they ours.
807	Now, Mars, I prithee, make us quick in work,
808	That we with smoking swords may march from hence,
809	To help our fielded friends! Come, blow thy blast.
810	
811	[They sound a parley. Enter two Senators with others
812	on the walls]
813	
814	Tutus Aufidius, is he within your walls?
815	
816	First Senator	No, nor a man that fears you less than he,
817	That's lesser than a little.
818	
819	[Drums afar off]
820	
821	Hark! our drums
822	Are bringing forth our youth. We'll break our walls,
823	Rather than they shall pound us up: our gates,
824	Which yet seem shut, we, have but pinn'd with rushes;
825	They'll open of themselves.
826	
827	[Alarum afar off]
828	
829	Hark you. far off!
830	There is Aufidius; list, what work he makes
831	Amongst your cloven army.
832	
833	MARCIUS	O, they are at it!
834	
835	LARTIUS	Their noise be our instruction. Ladders, ho!
836	
837	[Enter the army of the Volsces]
838	
839	MARCIUS	They fear us not, but issue forth their city.
840	Now put your shields before your hearts, and fight
841	With hearts more proof than shields. Advance,
842	brave Titus:
843	They do disdain us much beyond our thoughts,
844	Which makes me sweat with wrath. Come on, my fellows:
845	He that retires I'll take him for a Volsce,
846	And he shall feel mine edge.
847	
848	[Alarum. The Romans are beat back to their
849	trenches. Re-enter MARCIUS cursing]
850	
851	MARCIUS	All the contagion of the south light on you,
852	You shames of Rome! you herd of--Boils and plagues
853	Plaster you o'er, that you may be abhorr'd
854	Further than seen and one infect another
855	Against the wind a mile! You souls of geese,
856	That bear the shapes of men, how have you run
857	From slaves that apes would beat! Pluto and hell!
858	All hurt behind; backs red, and faces pale
859	With flight and agued fear! Mend and charge home,
860	Or, by the fires of heaven, I'll leave the foe
861	And make my wars on you: look to't: come on;
862	If you'll stand fast, we'll beat them to their wives,
863	As they us to our trenches followed.
864	
865	[Another alarum. The Volsces fly, and MARCIUS
866	follows them to the gates]
867	
868	So, now the gates are ope: now prove good seconds:
869	'Tis for the followers fortune widens them,
870	Not for the fliers: mark me, and do the like.
871	
872	[Enters the gates]
873	
874	First Soldier	Fool-hardiness; not I.
875	
876	Second Soldier	Nor I.
877	
878	[MARCIUS is shut in]
879	
880	First Soldier	See, they have shut him in.
881	
882	All	To the pot, I warrant him.
883	
884	[Alarum continues]
885	
886	[Re-enter TITUS LARTIUS]
887	
888	LARTIUS	What is become of Marcius?
889	
890	All	Slain, sir, doubtless.
891	
892	First Soldier	Following the fliers at the very heels,
893	With them he enters; who, upon the sudden,
894	Clapp'd to their gates: he is himself alone,
895	To answer all the city.
896	
897	LARTIUS	O noble fellow!
898	Who sensibly outdares his senseless sword,
899	And, when it bows, stands up. Thou art left, Marcius:
900	A carbuncle entire, as big as thou art,
901	Were not so rich a jewel. Thou wast a soldier
902	Even to Cato's wish, not fierce and terrible
903	Only in strokes; but, with thy grim looks and
904	The thunder-like percussion of thy sounds,
905	Thou madst thine enemies shake, as if the world
906	Were feverous and did tremble.
907	
908	[Re-enter MARCIUS, bleeding, assaulted by the enemy]
909	
910	First Soldier	Look, sir.
911	
912	LARTIUS	O,'tis Marcius!
913	Let's fetch him off, or make remain alike.

931	
932	First Roman	This will I carry to Rome.
933	
934	Second Roman	And I this.
935	
936	Third Roman	A murrain on't! I took this for silver.
937	
938	[Alarum continues still afar off]
939	
940	[Enter MARCIUS and TITUS LARTIUS with a trumpet]
941	
942	MARCIUS	See here these movers that do prize their hours
943	At a crack'd drachm! Cushions, leaden spoons,
944	Irons of a doit, doublets that hangmen would
945	Bury with those that wore them, these base slaves,
946	Ere yet the fight be done, pack up: down with them!
947	And hark, what noise the general makes! To him!
948	There is the man of my soul's hate, Aufidius,
949	Piercing our Romans: then, valiant Titus, take
950	Convenient numbers to make good the city;
951	Whilst I, with those that have the spirit, will haste
952	To help Cominius.
953	
954	LARTIUS	                  Worthy sir, thou bleed'st;
955	Thy exercise hath been too violent for
956	A second course of fight.
957	
958	MARCIUS	Sir, praise me not;
959	My work hath yet not warm'd me: fare you well:
960	The blood I drop is rather physical
961	Than dangerous to me: to Aufidius thus
962	I will appear, and fight.
963	
964	LARTIUS	Now the fair goddess, Fortune,
965	Fall deep in love with thee; and her great charms
966	Misguide thy opposers' swords! Bold gentleman,
967	Prosperity be thy page!
968	
969	MARCIUS	Thy friend no less
970	Than those she placeth highest! So, farewell.
971	
972	LARTIUS	Thou worthiest Marcius!
973	
974	[Exit MARCIUS]
975	
976	Go, sound thy trumpet in the market-place;
977	Call thither all the officers o' the town,

996	with soldiers]
997	
998	COMINIUS	Breathe you, my friends: well fought;
999	we are come off
1000	Like Romans, neither foolish in our stands,
1001	Nor cowardly in retire: believe me, sirs,
1002	We shall be charged again. Whiles we have struck,
1003	By interims and conveying gusts we have heard
1004	The charges of our friends. Ye Roman gods!
1005	Lead their successes as we wish our own,
1006	That both our powers, with smiling
1007	fronts encountering,
1008	May give you thankful sacrifice.
1009	
1010	[Enter a Messenger]
1011	
1012	Thy news?
1013	
1014	Messenger	The citizens of Corioli have issued,
1015	And given to Lartius and to Marcius battle:
1016	I saw our party to their trenches driven,
1017	And then I came away.
1018	
1019	COMINIUS	Though thou speak'st truth,
1020	Methinks thou speak'st not well.
1021	How long is't since?
1022	
1023	Messenger	Above an hour, my lord.
1024	
1025	COMINIUS	'Tis not a mile; briefly we heard their drums:
1026	How couldst thou in a mile confound an hour,
1027	And bring thy news so late?
1028	
1029	Messenger	Spies of the Volsces
1030	Held me in chase, that I was forced to wheel
1031	Three or four miles about, else had I, sir,
1032	Half an hour since brought my report.
1033	
1034	COMINIUS	Who's yonder,
1035	That does appear as he were flay'd? O gods
1036	He has the stamp of Marcius; and I have
1037	Before-time seen him thus.
1038	
1039	MARCIUS	[Within]                 Come I too late?
1040	
1041	COMINIUS	The shepherd knows not thunder from a tabour
1042	More than I know the sound of Marcius' tongue
1043	From every meaner man.
1044	
1045	[Enter MARCIUS]
1046	
1047	MARCIUS	Come I too late?
1048	
1049	COMINIUS	Ay, if you come not in the blood of others,
1050	But mantled in your own.
1051	
1052	MARCIUS	O, let me clip ye
1053	In arms as sound as when I woo'd, in heart
1054	As merry as when our nuptial day was done,
1055	And tapers burn'd to bedward!
1056	
1057	COMINIUS	Flower of warriors,
1058	How is it with Titus Lartius?
1059	
1060	MARCIUS	As with a man busied about decrees:
1061	Condemning some to death, and some to exile;
1062	Ransoming him, or pitying, threatening the other;
1063	Holding Corioli in the name of Rome,
1064	Even like a fawning greyhound in the leash,
1065	To let him slip at will.
1066	
1067	COMINIUS	Where is that slave
1068	Which told me they had beat you to your trenches?
1069	Where is he? call him hither.
1070	
1071	MARCIUS	Let him alone;
1072	He did inform the truth: but for our gentlemen,
1073	The common file--a plague! tribunes for them!--
1074	The mouse ne'er shunn'd the cat as they did budge
1075	From rascals worse than they.
1076	
1077	COMINIUS	But how prevail'd you?
1078	
1079	MARCIUS	Will the time serve to tell? I do not think.
1080	Where is the enemy? are you lords o' the field?
1081	If not, why cease you till you are so?
1082	
1083	COMINIUS	Marcius,
1084	We have at disadvantage fought and did
1085	Retire to win our purpose.
1086	
1087	MARCIUS	How lies their battle? know you on which side
1088	They have placed their men of trust?
1089	
1090	COMINIUS	As I guess, Marcius,
1091	Their bands i' the vaward are the Antiates,
1092	Of their best trust; o'er them Aufidius,
1093	Their very heart of hope.
1094	
1095	MARCIUS	I do beseech you,
1096	By all the battles wherein we have fought,
1097	By the blood we have shed together, by the vows
1098	We have made to endure friends, that you directly
1099	Set me against Aufidius and his Antiates;
1100	And that you not delay the present, but,
1101	Filling the air with swords advanced and darts,
1102	We prove this very hour.
1103	
1104	COMINIUS	Though I could wish
1105	You were conducted to a gentle bath
1106	And balms applied to, you, yet dare I never
1107	Deny your asking: take your choice of those
1108	That best can aid your action.
1109	
1110	MARCIUS	Those are they
1111	That most are willing. If any such be here--
1112	As it were sin to doubt--that love this painting
1113	Wherein you see me smear'd; if any fear
1114	Lesser his person than an ill report;
1115	If any think brave death outweighs bad life
1116	And that his country's dearer than himself;
1117	Let him alone, or so many so minded,
1118	Wave thus, to express his disposition,
1119	And follow Marcius.
1120	
1121	[They all shout and wave their swords, take him up in
1122	their arms, and cast up their caps]
1123	
1124	O, me alone! make you a sword of me?
1125	If these shows be not outward, which of you
1126	But is four Volsces? none of you but is
1127	Able to bear against the great Aufidius
1128	A shield as hard as his. A certain number,
1129	Though thanks to all, must I select
1130	from all: the rest
1131	Shall bear the business in some other fight,
1132	As cause will be obey'd. Please you to march;
1133	And four shall quickly draw out my command,
1134	Which men are best inclined.
1135	
1136	COMINIUS	March on, my fellows:
1137	Make good this ostentation, and you shall
1138	Divide in all with us.

1155	[TITUS LARTIUS, having set a guard upon
1156	Corioli, going with drum and trumpet toward
1157	COMINIUS and CAIUS MARCIUS, enters with
1158	Lieutenant, other Soldiers, and a Scout]
1159	
1160	LARTIUS	So, let the ports be guarded: keep your duties,
1161	As I have set them down. If I do send, dispatch
1162	Those centuries to our aid: the rest will serve
1163	For a short holding: if we lose the field,
1164	We cannot keep the town.
1165	
1166	Lieutenant	Fear not our care, sir.
1167	
1168	LARTIUS	Hence, and shut your gates upon's.
1169	Our guider, come; to the Roman camp conduct us.

1185	
1186	[Alarum as in battle. Enter, from opposite sides,
1187	MARCIUS and AUFIDIUS]
1188	
1189	MARCIUS	I'll fight with none but thee; for I do hate thee
1190	Worse than a promise-breaker.
1191	
1192	AUFIDIUS	We hate alike:
1193	Not Afric owns a serpent I abhor
1194	More than thy fame and envy. Fix thy foot.
1195	
1196	MARCIUS	Let the first budger die the other's slave,
1197	And the gods doom him after!
1198	
1199	AUFIDIUS	If I fly, Marcius,
1200	Holloa me like a hare.
1201	
1202	MARCIUS	Within these three hours, Tullus,
1203	Alone I fought in your Corioli walls,
1204	And made what work I pleased: 'tis not my blood
1205	Wherein thou seest me mask'd; for thy revenge
1206	Wrench up thy power to the highest.
1207	
1208	AUFIDIUS	Wert thou the Hector
1209	That was the whip of your bragg'd progeny,
1210	Thou shouldst not scape me here.
1211	
1212	[They fight, and certain Volsces come to the aid of
1213	AUFIDIUS. MARCIUS fights till they be driven in
1214	breathless]
1215	
1216	Officious, and not valiant, you have shamed me

1232	
1233	
1234	[Flourish. Alarum. A retreat is sounded. Flourish.
1235	Enter, from one side, COMINIUS with the Romans; from
1236	the other side, MARCIUS, with his arm in a scarf]
1237	
1238	COMINIUS	If I should tell thee o'er this thy day's work,
1239	Thou'ldst not believe thy deeds: but I'll report it
1240	Where senators shall mingle tears with smiles,
1241	Where great patricians shall attend and shrug,
1242	I' the end admire, where ladies shall be frighted,
1243	And, gladly quaked, hear more; where the
1244	dull tribunes,
1245	That, with the fusty plebeians, hate thine honours,
1246	Shall say against their hearts 'We thank the gods
1247	Our Rome hath such a soldier.'
1248	Yet camest thou to a morsel of this feast,
1249	Having fully dined before.
1250	
1251	[Enter TITUS LARTIUS, with his power,
1252	from the pursuit]
1253	
1254	LARTIUS	O general,
1255	Here is the steed, we the caparison:
1256	Hadst thou beheld--
1257	
1258	MARCIUS	Pray now, no more: my mother,
1259	Who has a charter to extol her blood,
1260	When she does praise me grieves me. I have done
1261	As you have done; that's what I can; induced
1262	As you have been; that's for my country:
1263	He that has but effected his good will
1264	Hath overta'en mine act.
1265	
1266	COMINIUS	You shall not be
1267	The grave of your deserving; Rome must know
1268	The value of her own: 'twere a concealment
1269	Worse than a theft, no less than a traducement,
1270	To hide your doings; and to silence that,
1271	Which, to the spire and top of praises vouch'd,
1272	Would seem but modest: therefore, I beseech you
1273	In sign of what you are, not to reward
1274	What you have done--before our army hear me.
1275	
1276	MARCIUS	I have some wounds upon me, and they smart
1277	To hear themselves remember'd.
1278	
1279	COMINIUS	Should they not,
1280	Well might they fester 'gainst ingratitude,
1281	And tent themselves with death. Of all the horses,
1282	Whereof we have ta'en good and good store, of all
1283	The treasure in this field achieved and city,
1284	We render you the tenth, to be ta'en forth,
1285	Before the common distribution, at
1286	Your only choice.
1287	
1288	MARCIUS	                  I thank you, general;
1289	But cannot make my heart consent to take
1290	A bribe to pay my sword: I do refuse it;
1291	And stand upon my common part with those
1292	That have beheld the doing.
1293	
1294	[A long flourish. They all cry 'Marcius! Marcius!'
1295	cast up their caps and lances: COMINIUS and LARTIUS
1296	stand bare]
1297	
1298	MARCIUS	May these same instruments, which you profane,
1299	Never sound more! when drums and trumpets shall
1300	I' the field prove flatterers, let courts and cities be
1301	Made all of false-faced soothing!
1302	When steel grows soft as the parasite's silk,
1303	Let him be made a coverture for the wars!
1304	No more, I say! For that I have not wash'd
1305	My nose that bled, or foil'd some debile wretch.--
1306	Which, without note, here's many else have done,--
1307	You shout me forth
1308	In acclamations hyperbolical;
1309	As if I loved my little should be dieted
1310	In praises sauced with lies.
1311	
1312	COMINIUS	Too modest are you;
1313	More cruel to your good report than grateful
1314	To us that give you truly: by your patience,
1315	If 'gainst yourself you be incensed, we'll put you,
1316	Like one that means his proper harm, in manacles,
1317	Then reason safely with you. Therefore, be it known,
1318	As to us, to all the world, that Caius Marcius
1319	Wears this war's garland: in token of the which,
1320	My noble steed, known to the camp, I give him,
1321	With all his trim belonging; and from this time,
1322	For what he did before Corioli, call him,
1323	With all the applause and clamour of the host,
1324	CAIUS MARCIUS CORIOLANUS! Bear
1325	The addition nobly ever!
1326	
1327	[Flourish. Trumpets sound, and drums]
1328	
1329	All	Caius Marcius Coriolanus!
1330	
1331	CORIOLANUS	I will go wash;
1332	And when my face is fair, you shall perceive
1333	Whether I blush or no: howbeit, I thank you.
1334	I mean to stride your steed, and at all times
1335	To undercrest your good addition
1336	To the fairness of my power.
1337	
1338	COMINIUS	So, to our tent;
1339	Where, ere we do repose us, we will write
1340	To Rome of our success. You, Titus Lartius,
1341	Must to Corioli back: send us to Rome
1342	The best, with whom we may articulate,
1343	For their own good and ours.
1344	
1345	LARTIUS	I shall, my lord.
1346	
1347	CORIOLANUS	The gods begin to mock me. I, that now
1348	Refused most princely gifts, am bound to beg
1349	Of my lord general.
1350	
1351	COMINIUS	Take't; 'tis yours. What is't?
1352	
1353	CORIOLANUS	I sometime lay here in Corioli
1354	At a poor man's house; he used me kindly:
1355	He cried to me; I saw him prisoner;
1356	But then Aufidius was within my view,
1357	And wrath o'erwhelm'd my pity: I request you
1358	To give my poor host freedom.
1359	
1360	COMINIUS	O, well begg'd!
1361	Were he the butcher of my son, he should
1362	Be free as is the wind. Deliver him, Titus.
1363	
1364	LARTIUS	Marcius, his name?
1365	
1366	CORIOLANUS	                  By Jupiter! forgot.
1367	I am weary; yea, my memory is tired.
1368	Have we no wine here?
1369	
1370	COMINIUS	Go we to our tent:
1371	The blood upon your visage dries; 'tis time
1372	It should be look'd to: come.

1387	
1388	
1389	[A flourish. Cornets. Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS,
1390	bloody, with two or three Soldiers]
1391	
1392	AUFIDIUS	The town is ta'en!
1393	
1394	First Soldier	'Twill be deliver'd back on good condition.
1395	
1396	AUFIDIUS	Condition!
1397	I would I were a Roman; for I cannot,
1398	Being a Volsce, be that I am. Condition!
1399	What good condition can a treaty find
1400	I' the part that is at mercy? Five times, Marcius,
1401	I have fought with thee: so often hast thou beat me,
1402	And wouldst do so, I think, should we encounter
1403	As often as we eat. By the elements,
1404	If e'er again I meet him beard to beard,
1405	He's mine, or I am his: mine emulation
1406	Hath not that honour in't it had; for where
1407	I thought to crush him in an equal force,
1408	True sword to sword, I'll potch at him some way
1409	Or wrath or craft may get him.
1410	
1411	First Soldier	He's the devil.
1412	
1413	AUFIDIUS	Bolder, though not so subtle. My valour's poison'd
1414	With only suffering stain by him; for him
1415	Shall fly out of itself: nor sleep nor sanctuary,
1416	Being naked, sick, nor fane nor Capitol,
1417	The prayers of priests nor times of sacrifice,
1418	Embarquements all of fury, shall lift up
1419	Their rotten privilege and custom 'gainst
1420	My hate to Marcius: where I find him, were it
1421	At home, upon my brother's guard, even there,
1422	Against the hospitable canon, would I
1423	Wash my fierce hand in's heart. Go you to the city;
1424	Learn how 'tis held; and what they are that must
1425	Be hostages for Rome.
1426	
1427	First Soldier	Will not you go?
1428	
1429	AUFIDIUS	I am attended at the cypress grove: I pray you--
1430	'Tis south the city mills--bring me word thither
1431	How the world goes, that to the pace of it
1432	I may spur on my journey.
1433	
1434	First Soldier	I shall, sir.

1449	
1450	
1451	[Enter MENENIUS with the two Tribunes of the people,
1452	SICINIUS and BRUTUS.
1453	
1454	MENENIUS	The augurer tells me we shall have news to-night.
1455	
1456	BRUTUS	Good or bad?
1457	
1458	MENENIUS	Not according to the prayer of the people, for they
1459	love not Marcius.
1460	
1461	SICINIUS	Nature teaches beasts to know their friends.
1462	
1463	MENENIUS	Pray you, who does the wolf love?
1464	
1465	SICINIUS	The lamb.
1466	
1467	MENENIUS	Ay, to devour him; as the hungry plebeians would the
1468	noble Marcius.
1469	
1470	BRUTUS	He's a lamb indeed, that baes like a bear.
1471	
1472	MENENIUS	He's a bear indeed, that lives like a lamb. You two
1473	are old men: tell me one thing that I shall ask you.
1474	
1475	Both	Well, sir.
1476	
1477	MENENIUS	In what enormity is Marcius poor in, that you two
1478	have not in abundance?
1479	
1480	BRUTUS	He's poor in no one fault, but stored with all.
1481	
1482	SICINIUS	Especially in pride.
1483	
1484	BRUTUS	And topping all others in boasting.
1485	
1486	MENENIUS	This is strange now: do you two know how you are
1487	censured here in the city, I mean of us o' the
1488	right-hand file? do you?
1489	
1490	Both	Why, how are we censured?
1491	
1492	MENENIUS	Because you talk of pride now,--will you not be angry?
1493	
1494	Both	Well, well, sir, well.
1495	
1496	MENENIUS	Why, 'tis no great matter; for a very little thief of
1497	occasion will rob you of a great deal of patience:
1498	give your dispositions the reins, and be angry at
1499	your pleasures; at the least if you take it as a
1500	pleasure to you in being so. You blame Marcius for
1501	being proud?
1502	
1503	BRUTUS	We do it not alone, sir.
1504	
1505	MENENIUS	I know you can do very little alone; for your helps
1506	are many, or else your actions would grow wondrous
1507	single: your abilities are too infant-like for
1508	doing much alone. You talk of pride: O that you
1509	could turn your eyes toward the napes of your necks,
1510	and make but an interior survey of your good selves!
1511	O that you could!
1512	
1513	BRUTUS	What then, sir?
1514	
1515	MENENIUS	Why, then you should discover a brace of unmeriting,
1516	proud, violent, testy magistrates, alias fools, as
1517	any in Rome.
1518	
1519	SICINIUS	Menenius, you are known well enough too.
1520	
1521	MENENIUS	I am known to be a humorous patrician, and one that
1522	loves a cup of hot wine with not a drop of allaying
1523	Tiber in't; said to be something imperfect in
1524	favouring the first complaint; hasty and tinder-like
1525	upon too trivial motion; one that converses more
1526	with the buttock of the night than with the forehead
1527	of the morning: what I think I utter, and spend my
1528	malice in my breath. Meeting two such wealsmen as
1529	you are--I cannot call you Lycurguses--if the drink
1530	you give me touch my palate adversely, I make a
1531	crooked face at it. I can't say your worships have
1532	delivered the matter well, when I find the ass in
1533	compound with the major part of your syllables: and
1534	though I must be content to bear with those that say
1535	you are reverend grave men, yet they lie deadly that
1536	tell you you have good faces. If you see this in
1537	the map of my microcosm, follows it that I am known
1538	well enough too? what barm can your bisson
1539	conspectuities glean out of this character, if I be
1540	known well enough too?
1541	
1542	BRUTUS	Come, sir, come, we know you well enough.
1543	
1544	MENENIUS	You know neither me, yourselves nor any thing. You
1545	are ambitious for poor knaves' caps and legs: you
1546	wear out a good wholesome forenoon in hearing a
1547	cause between an orange wife and a fosset-seller;
1548	and then rejourn the controversy of three pence to a
1549	second day of audience. When you are hearing a
1550	matter between party and party, if you chance to be
1551	pinched with the colic, you make faces like
1552	mummers; set up the bloody flag against all
1553	patience; and, in roaring for a chamber-pot,
1554	dismiss the controversy bleeding the more entangled
1555	by your hearing: all the peace you make in their
1556	cause is, calling both the parties knaves. You are
1557	a pair of strange ones.
1558	
1559	BRUTUS	Come, come, you are well understood to be a
1560	perfecter giber for the table than a necessary
1561	bencher in the Capitol.
1562	
1563	MENENIUS	Our very priests must become mockers, if they shall
1564	encounter such ridiculous subjects as you are. When
1565	you speak best unto the purpose, it is not worth the
1566	wagging of your beards; and your beards deserve not
1567	so honourable a grave as to stuff a botcher's
1568	cushion, or to be entombed in an ass's pack-
1569	saddle. Yet you must be saying, Marcius is proud;
1570	who in a cheap estimation, is worth predecessors
1571	since Deucalion, though peradventure some of the
1572	best of 'em were hereditary hangmen. God-den to
1573	your worships: more of your conversation would
1574	infect my brain, being the herdsmen of the beastly
1575	plebeians: I will be bold to take my leave of you.
1576	
1577	[BRUTUS and SICINIUS go aside]
1578	
1579	[Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and VALERIA]
1580	
1581	How now, my as fair as noble ladies,--and the moon,
1582	were she earthly, no nobler,--whither do you follow
1583	your eyes so fast?
1584	
1585	VOLUMNIA	Honourable Menenius, my boy Marcius approaches; for
1586	the love of Juno, let's go.
1587	
1588	MENENIUS	Ha! Marcius coming home!
1589	
1590	VOLUMNIA	Ay, worthy Menenius; and with most prosperous
1591	approbation.
1592	
1593	MENENIUS	Take my cap, Jupiter, and I thank thee. Hoo!
1594	Marcius coming home!
1595	
1596	
1597	VOLUMNIA	|
1598	|  Nay,'tis true.
1599	VIRGILIA	|
1600	
1601	
1602	VOLUMNIA	Look, here's a letter from him: the state hath
1603	another, his wife another; and, I think, there's one
1604	at home for you.
1605	
1606	MENENIUS	I will make my very house reel tonight: a letter for
1607	me!
1608	
1609	VIRGILIA	Yes, certain, there's a letter for you; I saw't.
1610	
1611	MENENIUS	A letter for me! it gives me an estate of seven
1612	years' health; in which time I will make a lip at
1613	the physician: the most sovereign prescription in
1614	Galen is but empiricutic, and, to this preservative,
1615	of no better report than a horse-drench. Is he
1616	not wounded? he was wont to come home wounded.
1617	
1618	VIRGILIA	O, no, no, no.
1619	
1620	VOLUMNIA	O, he is wounded; I thank the gods for't.
1621	
1622	MENENIUS	So do I too, if it be not too much: brings a'
1623	victory in his pocket? the wounds become him.
1624	
1625	VOLUMNIA	On's brows: Menenius, he comes the third time home
1626	with the oaken garland.
1627	
1628	MENENIUS	Has he disciplined Aufidius soundly?
1629	
1630	VOLUMNIA	Titus Lartius writes, they fought together, but
1631	Aufidius got off.
1632	
1633	MENENIUS	And 'twas time for him too, I'll warrant him that:
1634	an he had stayed by him, I would not have been so
1635	fidiused for all the chests in Corioli, and the gold
1636	that's in them. Is the senate possessed of this?
1637	
1638	VOLUMNIA	Good ladies, let's go. Yes, yes, yes; the senate
1639	has letters from the general, wherein he gives my
1640	son the whole name of the war: he hath in this
1641	action outdone his former deeds doubly
1642	
1643	VALERIA	In troth, there's wondrous things spoke of him.
1644	
1645	MENENIUS	Wondrous! ay, I warrant you, and not without his
1646	true purchasing.
1647	
1648	VIRGILIA	The gods grant them true!
1649	
1650	VOLUMNIA	True! pow, wow.
1651	
1652	MENENIUS	True! I'll be sworn they are true.
1653	Where is he wounded?
1654	
1655	[To the Tribunes]
1656	
1657	God save your good worships! Marcius is coming
1658	home: he has more cause to be proud. Where is he wounded?
1659	
1660	VOLUMNIA	I' the shoulder and i' the left arm there will be
1661	large cicatrices to show the people, when he shall
1662	stand for his place. He received in the repulse of
1663	Tarquin seven hurts i' the body.
1664	
1665	MENENIUS	One i' the neck, and two i' the thigh,--there's
1666	nine that I know.
1667	
1668	VOLUMNIA	He had, before this last expedition, twenty-five
1669	wounds upon him.
1670	
1671	MENENIUS	Now it's twenty-seven: every gash was an enemy's grave.
1672	
1673	[A shout and flourish]
1674	
1675	Hark! the trumpets.
1676	
1677	VOLUMNIA	These are the ushers of Marcius: before him he
1678	carries noise, and behind him he leaves tears:
1679	Death, that dark spirit, in 's nervy arm doth lie;
1680	Which, being advanced, declines, and then men die.
1681	
1682	[A sennet. Trumpets sound. Enter COMINIUS the
1683	general, and TITUS LARTIUS; between them, CORIOLANUS,
1684	crowned with an oaken garland; with Captains and
1685	Soldiers, and a Herald]
1686	
1687	Herald	Know, Rome, that all alone Marcius did fight
1688	Within Corioli gates: where he hath won,
1689	With fame, a name to Caius Marcius; these
1690	In honour follows Coriolanus.
1691	Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
1692	
1693	[Flourish]
1694	
1695	All	Welcome to Rome, renowned Coriolanus!
1696	
1697	CORIOLANUS	No more of this; it does offend my heart:
1698	Pray now, no more.
1699	
1700	COMINIUS	                  Look, sir, your mother!
1701	
1702	CORIOLANUS	O,
1703	You have, I know, petition'd all the gods
1704	For my prosperity!
1705	
1706	[Kneels]
1707	
1708	VOLUMNIA	                  Nay, my good soldier, up;
1709	My gentle Marcius, worthy Caius, and
1710	By deed-achieving honour newly named,--
1711	What is it?--Coriolanus must I call thee?--
1712	But O, thy wife!
1713	
1714	CORIOLANUS	                  My gracious silence, hail!
1715	Wouldst thou have laugh'd had I come coffin'd home,
1716	That weep'st to see me triumph? Ay, my dear,
1717	Such eyes the widows in Corioli wear,
1718	And mothers that lack sons.
1719	
1720	MENENIUS	Now, the gods crown thee!
1721	
1722	CORIOLANUS	And live you yet?
1723	
1724	[To VALERIA]
1725	O my sweet lady, pardon.
1726	
1727	VOLUMNIA	I know not where to turn: O, welcome home:
1728	And welcome, general: and ye're welcome all.
1729	
1730	MENENIUS	A hundred thousand welcomes. I could weep
1731	And I could laugh, I am light and heavy. Welcome.
1732	A curse begin at very root on's heart,
1733	That is not glad to see thee! You are three
1734	That Rome should dote on: yet, by the faith of men,
1735	We have some old crab-trees here
1736	at home that will not
1737	Be grafted to your relish. Yet welcome, warriors:
1738	We call a nettle but a nettle and
1739	The faults of fools but folly.
1740	
1741	COMINIUS	Ever right.
1742	
1743	CORIOLANUS	Menenius ever, ever.
1744	
1745	Herald	Give way there, and go on!
1746	
1747	CORIOLANUS	[To VOLUMNIA and VIRGILIA]  Your hand, and yours:
1748	Ere in our own house I do shade my head,
1749	The good patricians must be visited;
1750	From whom I have received not only greetings,
1751	But with them change of honours.
1752	
1753	VOLUMNIA	I have lived
1754	To see inherited my very wishes
1755	And the buildings of my fancy: only
1756	There's one thing wanting, which I doubt not but
1757	Our Rome will cast upon thee.
1758	
1759	CORIOLANUS	Know, good mother,
1760	I had rather be their servant in my way,
1761	Than sway with them in theirs.
1762	
1763	COMINIUS	On, to the Capitol!
1764	
1765	[Flourish. Cornets. Exeunt in state, as before.
1766	BRUTUS and SICINIUS come forward]
1767	
1768	BRUTUS	All tongues speak of him, and the bleared sights
1769	Are spectacled to see him: your prattling nurse
1770	Into a rapture lets her baby cry
1771	While she chats him: the kitchen malkin pins
1772	Her richest lockram 'bout her reechy neck,
1773	Clambering the walls to eye him: stalls, bulks, windows,
1774	Are smother'd up, leads fill'd, and ridges horsed
1775	With variable complexions, all agreeing
1776	In earnestness to see him: seld-shown flamens
1777	Do press among the popular throngs and puff
1778	To win a vulgar station: or veil'd dames
1779	Commit the war of white and damask in
1780	Their nicely-gawded cheeks to the wanton spoil
1781	Of Phoebus' burning kisses: such a pother
1782	As if that whatsoever god who leads him
1783	Were slily crept into his human powers
1784	And gave him graceful posture.
1785	
1786	SICINIUS	On the sudden,
1787	I warrant him consul.
1788	
1789	BRUTUS	Then our office may,
1790	During his power, go sleep.
1791	
1792	SICINIUS	He cannot temperately transport his honours
1793	From where he should begin and end, but will
1794	Lose those he hath won.
1795	
1796	BRUTUS	In that there's comfort.
1797	
1798	SICINIUS	Doubt not
1799	The commoners, for whom we stand, but they
1800	Upon their ancient malice will forget
1801	With the least cause these his new honours, which
1802	That he will give them make I as little question
1803	As he is proud to do't.
1804	
1805	BRUTUS	I heard him swear,
1806	Were he to stand for consul, never would he
1807	Appear i' the market-place nor on him put
1808	The napless vesture of humility;
1809	Nor showing, as the manner is, his wounds
1810	To the people, beg their stinking breaths.
1811	
1812	SICINIUS	'Tis right.
1813	
1814	BRUTUS	It was his word: O, he would miss it rather
1815	Than carry it but by the suit of the gentry to him,
1816	And the desire of the nobles.
1817	
1818	SICINIUS	I wish no better
1819	Than have him hold that purpose and to put it
1820	In execution.
1821	
1822	BRUTUS	'Tis most like he will.
1823	
1824	SICINIUS	It shall be to him then as our good wills,
1825	A sure destruction.
1826	
1827	BRUTUS	So it must fall out
1828	To him or our authorities. For an end,
1829	We must suggest the people in what hatred
1830	He still hath held them; that to's power he would
1831	Have made them mules, silenced their pleaders and
1832	Dispropertied their freedoms, holding them,
1833	In human action and capacity,
1834	Of no more soul nor fitness for the world
1835	Than camels in the war, who have their provand
1836	Only for bearing burdens, and sore blows
1837	For sinking under them.
1838	
1839	SICINIUS	This, as you say, suggested
1840	At some time when his soaring insolence
1841	Shall touch the people--which time shall not want,
1842	If he be put upon 't; and that's as easy
1843	As to set dogs on sheep--will be his fire
1844	To kindle their dry stubble; and their blaze
1845	Shall darken him for ever.
1846	
1847	[Enter a Messenger]
1848	
1849	BRUTUS	What's the matter?
1850	
1851	Messenger	You are sent for to the Capitol. 'Tis thought
1852	That Marcius shall be consul:
1853	I have seen the dumb men throng to see him and
1854	The blind to bear him speak: matrons flung gloves,
1855	Ladies and maids their scarfs and handkerchers,
1856	Upon him as he pass'd: the nobles bended,
1857	As to Jove's statue, and the commons made
1858	A shower and thunder with their caps and shouts:
1859	I never saw the like.
1860	
1861	BRUTUS	Let's to the Capitol;
1862	And carry with us ears and eyes for the time,
1863	But hearts for the event.
1864	
1865	SICINIUS	Have with you.

1875	ACT II
1876	
1877	
1878	
1879	SCENE  II	The same. The Capitol.
1880	
1881	
1882	[Enter two Officers, to lay cushions]
1883	
1884	First Officer	Come, come, they are almost here. How many stand
1885	for consulships?
1886	
1887	Second Officer	Three, they say: but 'tis thought of every one
1888	Coriolanus will carry it.
1889	
1890	First Officer	That's a brave fellow; but he's vengeance proud, and
1891	loves not the common people.
1892	
1893	Second Officer	Faith, there had been many great men that have
1894	flattered the people, who ne'er loved them; and there
1895	be many that they have loved, they know not
1896	wherefore: so that, if they love they know not why,
1897	they hate upon no better a ground: therefore, for
1898	Coriolanus neither to care whether they love or hate
1899	him manifests the true knowledge he has in their
1900	disposition; and out of his noble carelessness lets
1901	them plainly see't.
1902	
1903	First Officer	If he did not care whether he had their love or no,
1904	he waved indifferently 'twixt doing them neither
1905	good nor harm: but he seeks their hate with greater
1906	devotion than can render it him; and leaves
1907	nothing undone that may fully discover him their
1908	opposite. Now, to seem to affect the malice and
1909	displeasure of the people is as bad as that which he
1910	dislikes, to flatter them for their love.
1911	
1912	Second Officer	He hath deserved worthily of his country: and his
1913	ascent is not by such easy degrees as those who,
1914	having been supple and courteous to the people,
1915	bonneted, without any further deed to have them at
1916	an into their estimation and report: but he hath so
1917	planted his honours in their eyes, and his actions
1918	in their hearts, that for their tongues to be
1919	silent, and not confess so much, were a kind of
1920	ingrateful injury; to report otherwise, were a
1921	malice, that, giving itself the lie, would pluck
1922	reproof and rebuke from every ear that heard it.
1923	
1924	First Officer	No more of him; he is a worthy man: make way, they
1925	are coming.
1926	
1927	[A sennet. Enter, with actors before them, COMINIUS
1928	the consul, MENENIUS, CORIOLANUS, Senators,
1929	SICINIUS and BRUTUS. The Senators take their
1930	places; the Tribunes take their Places by
1931	themselves. CORIOLANUS stands]
1932	
1933	MENENIUS	Having determined of the Volsces and
1934	To send for Titus Lartius, it remains,
1935	As the main point of this our after-meeting,
1936	To gratify his noble service that
1937	Hath thus stood for his country: therefore,
1938	please you,
1939	Most reverend and grave elders, to desire
1940	The present consul, and last general
1941	In our well-found successes, to report
1942	A little of that worthy work perform'd
1943	By Caius Marcius Coriolanus, whom
1944	We met here both to thank and to remember
1945	With honours like himself.
1946	
1947	First Senator	Speak, good Cominius:
1948	Leave nothing out for length, and make us think
1949	Rather our state's defective for requital
1950	Than we to stretch it out.
1951	
1952	[To the Tribunes]
1953	
1954	Masters o' the people,
1955	We do request your kindest ears, and after,
1956	Your loving motion toward the common body,
1957	To yield what passes here.
1958	
1959	SICINIUS	We are convented
1960	Upon a pleasing treaty, and have hearts
1961	Inclinable to honour and advance
1962	The theme of our assembly.
1963	
1964	BRUTUS	Which the rather
1965	We shall be blest to do, if he remember
1966	A kinder value of the people than
1967	He hath hereto prized them at.
1968	
1969	MENENIUS	That's off, that's off;
1970	I would you rather had been silent. Please you
1971	To hear Cominius speak?
1972	
1973	BRUTUS	Most willingly;
1974	But yet my caution was more pertinent
1975	Than the rebuke you give it.
1976	
1977	MENENIUS	He loves your people
1978	But tie him not to be their bedfellow.
1979	Worthy Cominius, speak.
1980	
1981	[CORIOLANUS offers to go away]
1982	
1983	Nay, keep your place.
1984	
1985	First Senator	Sit, Coriolanus; never shame to hear
1986	What you have nobly done.
1987	
1988	CORIOLANUS	Your horror's pardon:
1989	I had rather have my wounds to heal again
1990	Than hear say how I got them.
1991	
1992	BRUTUS	Sir, I hope
1993	My words disbench'd you not.
1994	
1995	CORIOLANUS	No, sir: yet oft,
1996	When blows have made me stay, I fled from words.
1997	You soothed not, therefore hurt not: but
1998	your people,
1999	I love them as they weigh.
2000	
2001	MENENIUS	Pray now, sit down.
2002	
2003	CORIOLANUS	I had rather have one scratch my head i' the sun
2004	When the alarum were struck than idly sit
2005	To hear my nothings monster'd.
2006	
2007	[Exit]
2008	
2009	MENENIUS	Masters of the people,
2010	Your multiplying spawn how can he flatter--
2011	That's thousand to one good one--when you now see
2012	He had rather venture all his limbs for honour
2013	Than one on's ears to hear it? Proceed, Cominius.
2014	
2015	COMINIUS	I shall lack voice: the deeds of Coriolanus
2016	Should not be utter'd feebly. It is held
2017	That valour is the chiefest virtue, and
2018	Most dignifies the haver: if it be,
2019	The man I speak of cannot in the world
2020	Be singly counterpoised. At sixteen years,
2021	When Tarquin made a head for Rome, he fought
2022	Beyond the mark of others: our then dictator,
2023	Whom with all praise I point at, saw him fight,
2024	When with his Amazonian chin he drove
2025	The bristled lips before him: be bestrid
2026	An o'er-press'd Roman and i' the consul's view
2027	Slew three opposers: Tarquin's self he met,
2028	And struck him on his knee: in that day's feats,
2029	When he might act the woman in the scene,
2030	He proved best man i' the field, and for his meed
2031	Was brow-bound with the oak. His pupil age
2032	Man-enter'd thus, he waxed like a sea,
2033	And in the brunt of seventeen battles since
2034	He lurch'd all swords of the garland. For this last,
2035	Before and in Corioli, let me say,
2036	I cannot speak him home: he stopp'd the fliers;
2037	And by his rare example made the coward
2038	Turn terror into sport: as weeds before
2039	A vessel under sail, so men obey'd
2040	And fell below his stem: his sword, death's stamp,
2041	Where it did mark, it took; from face to foot
2042	He was a thing of blood, whose every motion
2043	Was timed with dying cries: alone he enter'd
2044	The mortal gate of the city, which he painted
2045	With shunless destiny; aidless came off,
2046	And with a sudden reinforcement struck
2047	Corioli like a planet: now all's his:
2048	When, by and by, the din of war gan pierce
2049	His ready sense; then straight his doubled spirit
2050	Re-quicken'd what in flesh was fatigate,
2051	And to the battle came he; where he did
2052	Run reeking o'er the lives of men, as if
2053	'Twere a perpetual spoil: and till we call'd
2054	Both field and city ours, he never stood
2055	To ease his breast with panting.
2056	
2057	MENENIUS	Worthy man!
2058	
2059	First Senator	He cannot but with measure fit the honours
2060	Which we devise him.
2061	
2062	COMINIUS	Our spoils he kick'd at,
2063	And look'd upon things precious as they were
2064	The common muck of the world: he covets less
2065	Than misery itself would give; rewards
2066	His deeds with doing them, and is content
2067	To spend the time to end it.
2068	
2069	MENENIUS	He's right noble:
2070	Let him be call'd for.
2071	
2072	First Senator	Call Coriolanus.
2073	
2074	Officer	He doth appear.
2075	
2076	[Re-enter CORIOLANUS]
2077	
2078	MENENIUS	The senate, Coriolanus, are well pleased
2079	To make thee consul.
2080	
2081	CORIOLANUS	I do owe them still
2082	My life and services.
2083	
2084	MENENIUS	It then remains
2085	That you do speak to the people.
2086	
2087	CORIOLANUS	I do beseech you,
2088	Let me o'erleap that custom, for I cannot
2089	Put on the gown, stand naked and entreat them,
2090	For my wounds' sake, to give their suffrage: please you
2091	That I may pass this doing.
2092	
2093	SICINIUS	Sir, the people
2094	Must have their voices; neither will they bate
2095	One jot of ceremony.
2096	
2097	MENENIUS	Put them not to't:
2098	Pray you, go fit you to the custom and
2099	Take to you, as your predecessors have,
2100	Your honour with your form.
2101	
2102	CORIOLANUS	It is apart
2103	That I shall blush in acting, and might well
2104	Be taken from the people.
2105	
2106	BRUTUS	Mark you that?
2107	
2108	CORIOLANUS	To brag unto them, thus I did, and thus;
2109	Show them the unaching scars which I should hide,
2110	As if I had received them for the hire
2111	Of their breath only!
2112	
2113	MENENIUS	Do not stand upon't.
2114	We recommend to you, tribunes of the people,
2115	Our purpose to them: and to our noble consul
2116	Wish we all joy and honour.
2117	
2118	Senators	To Coriolanus come all joy and honour!
2119	
2120	[Flourish of cornets. Exeunt all but SICINIUS
2121	and BRUTUS]
2122	
2123	BRUTUS	You see how he intends to use the people.
2124	
2125	SICINIUS	May they perceive's intent! He will require them,
2126	As if he did contemn what he requested
2127	Should be in them to give.
2128	
2129	BRUTUS	Come, we'll inform them
2130	Of our proceedings here: on the marketplace,
2131	I know, they do attend us.

2141	ACT II
2142	
2143	
2144	
2145	SCENE III	The same. The Forum.
2146	
2147	
2148	[Enter seven or eight Citizens]
2149	
2150	First Citizen	Once, if he do require our voices, we ought not to deny him.
2151	
2152	Second Citizen	We may, sir, if we will.
2153	
2154	Third Citizen	We have power in ourselves to do it, but it is a
2155	power that we have no power to do; for if he show us
2156	his wounds and tell us his deeds, we are to put our
2157	tongues into those wounds and speak for them; so, if
2158	he tell us his noble deeds, we must also tell him
2159	our noble acceptance of them. Ingratitude is
2160	monstrous, and for the multitude to be ingrateful,
2161	were to make a monster of the multitude: of the
2162	which we being members, should bring ourselves to be
2163	monstrous members.
2164	
2165	First Citizen	And to make us no better thought of, a little help
2166	will serve; for once we stood up about the corn, he
2167	himself stuck not to call us the many-headed multitude.
2168	
2169	Third Citizen	We have been called so of many; not that our heads
2170	are some brown, some black, some auburn, some bald,
2171	but that our wits are so diversely coloured: and
2172	truly I think if all our wits were to issue out of
2173	one skull, they would fly east, west, north, south,
2174	and their consent of one direct way should be at
2175	once to all the points o' the compass.
2176	
2177	Second Citizen	Think you so? Which way do you judge my wit would
2178	fly?
2179	
2180	Third Citizen	Nay, your wit will not so soon out as another man's
2181	will;'tis strongly wedged up in a block-head, but
2182	if it were at liberty, 'twould, sure, southward.
2183	
2184	Second Citizen	Why that way?
2185	
2186	Third Citizen	To lose itself in a fog, where being three parts
2187	melted away with rotten dews, the fourth would return
2188	for conscience sake, to help to get thee a wife.
2189	
2190	Second Citizen	You are never without your tricks: you may, you may.
2191	
2192	Third Citizen	Are you all resolved to give your voices? But
2193	that's no matter, the greater part carries it. I
2194	say, if he would incline to the people, there was
2195	never a worthier man.
2196	
2197	[Enter CORIOLANUS in a gown of humility,
2198	with MENENIUS]

2200	Here he comes, and in the gown of humility: mark his
2201	behavior. We are not to stay all together, but to
2202	come by him where he stands, by ones, by twos, and
2203	by threes. He's to make his requests by
2204	particulars; wherein every one of us has a single
2205	honour, in giving him our own voices with our own
2206	tongues: therefore follow me, and I direct you how
2207	you shall go by him.
2208	
2209	All	Content, content.
2210	
2211	[Exeunt Citizens]
2212	
2213	MENENIUS	O sir, you are not right: have you not known
2214	The worthiest men have done't?
2215	
2216	CORIOLANUS	What must I say?
2217	'I Pray, sir'--Plague upon't! I cannot bring
2218	My tongue to such a pace:--'Look, sir, my wounds!
2219	I got them in my country's service, when
2220	Some certain of your brethren roar'd and ran
2221	From the noise of our own drums.'
2222	
2223	MENENIUS	O me, the gods!
2224	You must not speak of that: you must desire them
2225	To think upon you.
2226	
2227	CORIOLANUS	                  Think upon me! hang 'em!
2228	I would they would forget me, like the virtues
2229	Which our divines lose by 'em.
2230	
2231	MENENIUS	You'll mar all:
2232	I'll leave you: pray you, speak to 'em, I pray you,
2233	In wholesome manner.
2234	
2235	[Exit]
2236	
2237	CORIOLANUS	Bid them wash their faces
2238	And keep their teeth clean.
2239	
2240	[Re-enter two of the Citizens]
2241	
2242	So, here comes a brace.
2243	
2244	[Re-enter a third Citizen]
2245	
2246	You know the cause, air, of my standing here.
2247	
2248	Third Citizen	We do, sir; tell us what hath brought you to't.
2249	
2250	CORIOLANUS	Mine own desert.
2251	
2252	Second Citizen	Your own desert!
2253	
2254	CORIOLANUS	Ay, but not mine own desire.
2255	
2256	Third Citizen	How not your own desire?
2257	
2258	CORIOLANUS	No, sir,'twas never my desire yet to trouble the
2259	poor with begging.
2260	
2261	Third Citizen	You must think, if we give you any thing, we hope to
2262	gain by you.
2263	
2264	CORIOLANUS	Well then, I pray, your price o' the consulship?
2265	
2266	First Citizen	The price is to ask it kindly.
2267	
2268	CORIOLANUS	Kindly! Sir, I pray, let me ha't: I have wounds to
2269	show you, which shall be yours in private. Your
2270	good voice, sir; what say you?
2271	
2272	Second Citizen	You shall ha' it, worthy sir.
2273	
2274	CORIOLANUS	A match, sir. There's in all two worthy voices
2275	begged. I have your alms: adieu.
2276	
2277	Third Citizen	But this is something odd.
2278	
2279	Second Citizen	An 'twere to give again,--but 'tis no matter.
2280	
2281	[Exeunt the three Citizens]
2282	
2283	[Re-enter two other Citizens]
2284	
2285	CORIOLANUS	Pray you now, if it may stand with the tune of your
2286	voices that I may be consul, I have here the
2287	customary gown.
2288	
2289	Fourth Citizen	You have deserved nobly of your country, and you
2290	have not deserved nobly.
2291	
2292	CORIOLANUS	Your enigma?
2293	
2294	Fourth Citizen	You have been a scourge to her enemies, you have
2295	been a rod to her friends; you have not indeed loved
2296	the common people.
2297	
2298	CORIOLANUS	You should account me the more virtuous that I have
2299	not been common in my love. I will, sir, flatter my
2300	sworn brother, the people, to earn a dearer
2301	estimation of them; 'tis a condition they account
2302	gentle: and since the wisdom of their choice is
2303	rather to have my hat than my heart, I will practise
2304	the insinuating nod and be off to them most
2305	counterfeitly; that is, sir, I will counterfeit the
2306	bewitchment of some popular man and give it
2307	bountiful to the desirers. Therefore, beseech you,
2308	I may be consul.
2309	
2310	Fifth Citizen	We hope to find you our friend; and therefore give
2311	you our voices heartily.
2312	
2313	Fourth Citizen	You have received many wounds for your country.
2314	
2315	CORIOLANUS	I will not seal your knowledge with showing them. I
2316	will make much of your voices, and so trouble you no further.
2317	
2318	Both Citizens	The gods give you joy, sir, heartily!
2319	
2320	[Exeunt]
2321	
2322	CORIOLANUS	Most sweet voices!
2323	Better it is to die, better to starve,
2324	Than crave the hire which first we do deserve.
2325	Why in this woolvish toge should I stand here,
2326	To beg of Hob and Dick, that do appear,
2327	Their needless vouches? Custom calls me to't:
2328	What custom wills, in all things should we do't,
2329	The dust on antique time would lie unswept,
2330	And mountainous error be too highly heapt
2331	For truth to o'er-peer. Rather than fool it so,
2332	Let the high office and the honour go
2333	To one that would do thus. I am half through;
2334	The one part suffer'd, the other will I do.
2335	
2336	[Re-enter three Citizens more]
2337	
2338	Here come more voices.
2339	Your voices: for your voices I have fought;
2340	Watch'd for your voices; for Your voices bear
2341	Of wounds two dozen odd; battles thrice six
2342	I have seen and heard of; for your voices have
2343	Done many things, some less, some more your voices:
2344	Indeed I would be consul.
2345	
2346	Sixth Citizen	He has done nobly, and cannot go without any honest
2347	man's voice.
2348	
2349	Seventh Citizen	Therefore let him be consul: the gods give him joy,
2350	and make him good friend to the people!
2351	
2352	All Citizens	Amen, amen. God save thee, noble consul!
2353	
2354	[Exeunt]
2355	
2356	CORIOLANUS	Worthy voices!
2357	
2358	[Re-enter MENENIUS, with BRUTUS and SICINIUS]
2359	
2360	MENENIUS	You have stood your limitation; and the tribunes
2361	Endue you with the people's voice: remains
2362	That, in the official marks invested, you
2363	Anon do meet the senate.
2364	
2365	CORIOLANUS	Is this done?
2366	
2367	SICINIUS	The custom of request you have discharged:
2368	The people do admit you, and are summon'd
2369	To meet anon, upon your approbation.
2370	
2371	CORIOLANUS	Where? at the senate-house?
2372	
2373	SICINIUS	There, Coriolanus.
2374	
2375	CORIOLANUS	May I change these garments?
2376	
2377	SICINIUS	You may, sir.
2378	
2379	CORIOLANUS	That I'll straight do; and, knowing myself again,
2380	Repair to the senate-house.
2381	
2382	MENENIUS	I'll keep you company. Will you along?
2383	
2384	BRUTUS	We stay here for the people.
2385	
2386	SICINIUS	Fare you well.
2387	
2388	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and MENENIUS]
2389	
2390	He has it now, and by his looks methink
2391	'Tis warm at 's heart.
2392	
2393	BRUTUS	With a proud heart he wore his humble weeds.
2394	will you dismiss the people?
2395	
2396	[Re-enter Citizens]
2397	
2398	SICINIUS	How now, my masters! have you chose this man?
2399	
2400	First Citizen	He has our voices, sir.
2401	
2402	BRUTUS	We pray the gods he may deserve your loves.
2403	
2404	Second Citizen	Amen, sir: to my poor unworthy notice,
2405	He mock'd us when he begg'd our voices.
2406	
2407	Third Citizen	Certainly
2408	He flouted us downright.
2409	
2410	First Citizen	No,'tis his kind of speech: he did not mock us.
2411	
2412	Second Citizen	Not one amongst us, save yourself, but says
2413	He used us scornfully: he should have show'd us
2414	His marks of merit, wounds received for's country.
2415	
2416	SICINIUS	Why, so he did, I am sure.
2417	
2418	Citizens	No, no; no man saw 'em.
2419	
2420	Third Citizen	He said he had wounds, which he could show
2421	in private;
2422	And with his hat, thus waving it in scorn,
2423	'I would be consul,' says he: 'aged custom,
2424	But by your voices, will not so permit me;
2425	Your voices therefore.' When we granted that,
2426	Here was 'I thank you for your voices: thank you:
2427	Your most sweet voices: now you have left
2428	your voices,
2429	I have no further with you.' Was not this mockery?
2430	
2431	SICINIUS	Why either were you ignorant to see't,
2432	Or, seeing it, of such childish friendliness
2433	To yield your voices?
2434	
2435	BRUTUS	Could you not have told him
2436	As you were lesson'd, when he had no power,
2437	But was a petty servant to the state,
2438	He was your enemy, ever spake against
2439	Your liberties and the charters that you bear
2440	I' the body of the weal; and now, arriving
2441	A place of potency and sway o' the state,
2442	If he should still malignantly remain
2443	Fast foe to the plebeii, your voices might
2444	Be curses to yourselves? You should have said
2445	That as his worthy deeds did claim no less
2446	Than what he stood for, so his gracious nature
2447	Would think upon you for your voices and
2448	Translate his malice towards you into love,
2449	Standing your friendly lord.
2450	
2451	SICINIUS	Thus to have said,
2452	As you were fore-advised, had touch'd his spirit
2453	And tried his inclination; from him pluck'd
2454	Either his gracious promise, which you might,
2455	As cause had call'd you up, have held him to
2456	Or else it would have gall'd his surly nature,
2457	Which easily endures not article
2458	Tying him to aught; so putting him to rage,
2459	You should have ta'en the advantage of his choler
2460	And pass'd him unelected.
2461	
2462	BRUTUS	Did you perceive
2463	He did solicit you in free contempt
2464	When he did need your loves, and do you think
2465	That his contempt shall not be bruising to you,
2466	When he hath power to crush? Why, had your bodies
2467	No heart among you? or had you tongues to cry
2468	Against the rectorship of judgment?
2469	
2470	SICINIUS	Have you
2471	Ere now denied the asker? and now again
2472	Of him that did not ask, but mock, bestow
2473	Your sued-for tongues?
2474	
2475	Third Citizen	He's not confirm'd; we may deny him yet.
2476	
2477	Second Citizen	And will deny him:
2478	I'll have five hundred voices of that sound.
2479	
2480	First Citizen	I twice five hundred and their friends to piece 'em.
2481	
2482	BRUTUS	Get you hence instantly, and tell those friends,
2483	They have chose a consul that will from them take
2484	Their liberties; make them of no more voice
2485	Than dogs that are as often beat for barking
2486	As therefore kept to do so.
2487	
2488	SICINIUS	Let them assemble,
2489	And on a safer judgment all revoke
2490	Your ignorant election; enforce his pride,
2491	And his old hate unto you; besides, forget not
2492	With what contempt he wore the humble weed,
2493	How in his suit he scorn'd you; but your loves,
2494	Thinking upon his services, took from you
2495	The apprehension of his present portance,
2496	Which most gibingly, ungravely, he did fashion
2497	After the inveterate hate he bears you.
2498	
2499	BRUTUS	Lay
2500	A fault on us, your tribunes; that we laboured,
2501	No impediment between, but that you must
2502	Cast your election on him.
2503	
2504	SICINIUS	Say, you chose him
2505	More after our commandment than as guided
2506	By your own true affections, and that your minds,
2507	Preoccupied with what you rather must do
2508	Than what you should, made you against the grain
2509	To voice him consul: lay the fault on us.
2510	
2511	BRUTUS	Ay, spare us not. Say we read lectures to you.
2512	How youngly he began to serve his country,
2513	How long continued, and what stock he springs of,
2514	The noble house o' the Marcians, from whence came
2515	That Ancus Marcius, Numa's daughter's son,
2516	Who, after great Hostilius, here was king;
2517	Of the same house Publius and Quintus were,
2518	That our beat water brought by conduits hither;
2519	And  [Censorinus,]  nobly named so,
2520	Twice being  [by the people chosen]  censor,
2521	Was his great ancestor.
2522	
2523	SICINIUS	One thus descended,
2524	That hath beside well in his person wrought
2525	To be set high in place, we did commend
2526	To your remembrances: but you have found,
2527	Scaling his present bearing with his past,
2528	That he's your fixed enemy, and revoke
2529	Your sudden approbation.
2530	
2531	BRUTUS	Say, you ne'er had done't--
2532	Harp on that still--but by our putting on;
2533	And presently, when you have drawn your number,
2534	Repair to the Capitol.
2535	
2536	All	We will so: almost all
2537	Repent in their election.
2538	
2539	[Exeunt Citizens]
2540	
2541	BRUTUS	Let them go on;
2542	This mutiny were better put in hazard,
2543	Than stay, past doubt, for greater:
2544	If, as his nature is, he fall in rage
2545	With their refusal, both observe and answer
2546	The vantage of his anger.
2547	
2548	SICINIUS	To the Capitol, come:
2549	We will be there before the stream o' the people;
2550	And this shall seem, as partly 'tis, their own,
2551	Which we have goaded onward.
2552	
2553	[Exeunt]
2554	
2555

2559	
2560	
2561	ACT III
2562	
2563	
2564	
2565	SCENE I	Rome. A street.
2566	
2567	
2568	[Cornets. Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, all the
2569	Gentry, COMINIUS, TITUS LARTIUS, and other Senators]
2570	
2571	CORIOLANUS	Tullus Aufidius then had made new head?
2572	
2573	LARTIUS	He had, my lord; and that it was which caused
2574	Our swifter composition.
2575	
2576	CORIOLANUS	So then the Volsces stand but as at first,
2577	Ready, when time shall prompt them, to make road.
2578	Upon's again.
2579	
2580	COMINIUS	They are worn, lord consul, so,
2581	That we shall hardly in our ages see
2582	Their banners wave again.
2583	
2584	CORIOLANUS	Saw you Aufidius?
2585	
2586	LARTIUS	On safe-guard he came to me; and did curse
2587	Against the Volsces, for they had so vilely
2588	Yielded the town: he is retired to Antium.
2589	
2590	CORIOLANUS	Spoke he of me?
2591	
2592	LARTIUS	                  He did, my lord.
2593	
2594	CORIOLANUS	How? what?
2595	
2596	LARTIUS	How often he had met you, sword to sword;
2597	That of all things upon the earth he hated
2598	Your person most, that he would pawn his fortunes
2599	To hopeless restitution, so he might
2600	Be call'd your vanquisher.
2601	
2602	CORIOLANUS	At Antium lives he?
2603	
2604	LARTIUS	At Antium.
2605	
2606	CORIOLANUS	I wish I had a cause to seek him there,
2607	To oppose his hatred fully. Welcome home.
2608	
2609	[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
2610	
2611	Behold, these are the tribunes of the people,
2612	The tongues o' the common mouth: I do despise them;
2613	For they do prank them in authority,
2614	Against all noble sufferance.
2615	
2616	SICINIUS	Pass no further.
2617	
2618	CORIOLANUS	Ha! what is that?
2619	
2620	BRUTUS	It will be dangerous to go on: no further.
2621	
2622	CORIOLANUS	What makes this change?
2623	
2624	MENENIUS	The matter?
2625	
2626	COMINIUS	Hath he not pass'd the noble and the common?
2627	
2628	BRUTUS	Cominius, no.
2629	
2630	CORIOLANUS	                  Have I had children's voices?
2631	
2632	First Senator	Tribunes, give way; he shall to the market-place.
2633	
2634	BRUTUS	The people are incensed against him.
2635	
2636	SICINIUS	Stop,
2637	Or all will fall in broil.
2638	
2639	CORIOLANUS	Are these your herd?
2640	Must these have voices, that can yield them now
2641	And straight disclaim their tongues? What are
2642	your offices?
2643	You being their mouths, why rule you not their teeth?
2644	Have you not set them on?
2645	
2646	MENENIUS	Be calm, be calm.
2647	
2648	CORIOLANUS	It is a purposed thing, and grows by plot,
2649	To curb the will of the nobility:
2650	Suffer't, and live with such as cannot rule
2651	Nor ever will be ruled.
2652	
2653	BRUTUS	Call't not a plot:
2654	The people cry you mock'd them, and of late,
2655	When corn was given them gratis, you repined;
2656	Scandal'd the suppliants for the people, call'd them
2657	Time-pleasers, flatterers, foes to nobleness.
2658	
2659	CORIOLANUS	Why, this was known before.
2660	
2661	BRUTUS	Not to them all.
2662	
2663	CORIOLANUS	Have you inform'd them sithence?
2664	
2665	BRUTUS	How! I inform them!
2666	
2667	CORIOLANUS	You are like to do such business.
2668	
2669	BRUTUS	Not unlike,
2670	Each way, to better yours.
2671	
2672	CORIOLANUS	Why then should I be consul? By yond clouds,
2673	Let me deserve so ill as you, and make me
2674	Your fellow tribune.
2675	
2676	SICINIUS	You show too much of that
2677	For which the people stir: if you will pass
2678	To where you are bound, you must inquire your way,
2679	Which you are out of, with a gentler spirit,
2680	Or never be so noble as a consul,
2681	Nor yoke with him for tribune.
2682	
2683	MENENIUS	Let's be calm.
2684	
2685	COMINIUS	The people are abused; set on. This paltering
2686	Becomes not Rome, nor has Coriolanus
2687	Deserved this so dishonour'd rub, laid falsely
2688	I' the plain way of his merit.
2689	
2690	CORIOLANUS	Tell me of corn!
2691	This was my speech, and I will speak't again--
2692	
2693	MENENIUS	Not now, not now.
2694	
2695	First Senator	                  Not in this heat, sir, now.
2696	
2697	CORIOLANUS	Now, as I live, I will. My nobler friends,
2698	I crave their pardons:
2699	For the mutable, rank-scented many, let them
2700	Regard me as I do not flatter, and
2701	Therein behold themselves: I say again,
2702	In soothing them, we nourish 'gainst our senate
2703	The cockle of rebellion, insolence, sedition,
2704	Which we ourselves have plough'd for, sow'd,
2705	and scatter'd,
2706	By mingling them with us, the honour'd number,
2707	Who lack not virtue, no, nor power, but that
2708	Which they have given to beggars.
2709	
2710	MENENIUS	Well, no more.
2711	
2712	First Senator	No more words, we beseech you.
2713	
2714	CORIOLANUS	How! no more!
2715	As for my country I have shed my blood,
2716	Not fearing outward force, so shall my lungs
2717	Coin words till their decay against those measles,
2718	Which we disdain should tatter us, yet sought
2719	The very way to catch them.
2720	
2721	BRUTUS	You speak o' the people,
2722	As if you were a god to punish, not
2723	A man of their infirmity.
2724	
2725	SICINIUS	'Twere well
2726	We let the people know't.
2727	
2728	MENENIUS	What, what? his choler?
2729	
2730	CORIOLANUS	Choler!
2731	Were I as patient as the midnight sleep,
2732	By Jove, 'twould be my mind!
2733	
2734	SICINIUS	It is a mind
2735	That shall remain a poison where it is,
2736	Not poison any further.
2737	
2738	CORIOLANUS	Shall remain!
2739	Hear you this Triton of the minnows? mark you
2740	His absolute 'shall'?
2741	
2742	COMINIUS	'Twas from the canon.
2743	
2744	CORIOLANUS	'Shall'!
2745	O good but most unwise patricians! why,
2746	You grave but reckless senators, have you thus
2747	Given Hydra here to choose an officer,
2748	That with his peremptory 'shall,' being but
2749	The horn and noise o' the monster's, wants not spirit
2750	To say he'll turn your current in a ditch,
2751	And make your channel his? If he have power
2752	Then vail your ignorance; if none, awake
2753	Your dangerous lenity. If you are learn'd,
2754	Be not as common fools; if you are not,
2755	Let them have cushions by you. You are plebeians,
2756	If they be senators: and they are no less,
2757	When, both your voices blended, the great'st taste
2758	Most palates theirs. They choose their magistrate,
2759	And such a one as he, who puts his 'shall,'
2760	His popular 'shall' against a graver bench
2761	Than ever frown in Greece. By Jove himself!
2762	It makes the consuls base: and my soul aches
2763	To know, when two authorities are up,
2764	Neither supreme, how soon confusion
2765	May enter 'twixt the gap of both and take
2766	The one by the other.
2767	
2768	COMINIUS	Well, on to the market-place.
2769	
2770	CORIOLANUS	Whoever gave that counsel, to give forth
2771	The corn o' the storehouse gratis, as 'twas used
2772	Sometime in Greece,--
2773	
2774	MENENIUS	Well, well, no more of that.
2775	
2776	CORIOLANUS	Though there the people had more absolute power,
2777	I say, they nourish'd disobedience, fed
2778	The ruin of the state.
2779	
2780	BRUTUS	Why, shall the people give
2781	One that speaks thus their voice?
2782	
2783	CORIOLANUS	I'll give my reasons,
2784	More worthier than their voices. They know the corn
2785	Was not our recompense, resting well assured
2786	That ne'er did service for't: being press'd to the war,
2787	Even when the navel of the state was touch'd,
2788	They would not thread the gates. This kind of service
2789	Did not deserve corn gratis. Being i' the war
2790	Their mutinies and revolts, wherein they show'd
2791	Most valour, spoke not for them: the accusation
2792	Which they have often made against the senate,
2793	All cause unborn, could never be the motive
2794	Of our so frank donation. Well, what then?
2795	How shall this bisson multitude digest
2796	The senate's courtesy? Let deeds express
2797	What's like to be their words: 'we did request it;
2798	We are the greater poll, and in true fear
2799	They gave us our demands.' Thus we debase
2800	The nature of our seats and make the rabble
2801	Call our cares fears; which will in time
2802	Break ope the locks o' the senate and bring in
2803	The crows to peck the eagles.
2804	
2805	MENENIUS	Come, enough.
2806	
2807	BRUTUS	Enough, with over-measure.
2808	
2809	CORIOLANUS	No, take more:
2810	What may be sworn by, both divine and human,
2811	Seal what I end withal! This double worship,
2812	Where one part does disdain with cause, the other
2813	Insult without all reason, where gentry, title, wisdom,
2814	Cannot conclude but by the yea and no
2815	Of general ignorance,--it must omit
2816	Real necessities, and give way the while
2817	To unstable slightness: purpose so barr'd,
2818	it follows,
2819	Nothing is done to purpose. Therefore, beseech you,--
2820	You that will be less fearful than discreet,
2821	That love the fundamental part of state
2822	More than you doubt the change on't, that prefer
2823	A noble life before a long, and wish
2824	To jump a body with a dangerous physic
2825	That's sure of death without it, at once pluck out
2826	The multitudinous tongue; let them not lick
2827	The sweet which is their poison: your dishonour
2828	Mangles true judgment and bereaves the state
2829	Of that integrity which should become't,
2830	Not having the power to do the good it would,
2831	For the in which doth control't.
2832	
2833	BRUTUS	Has said enough.
2834	
2835	SICINIUS	Has spoken like a traitor, and shall answer
2836	As traitors do.
2837	
2838	CORIOLANUS	                  Thou wretch, despite o'erwhelm thee!
2839	What should the people do with these bald tribunes?
2840	On whom depending, their obedience fails
2841	To the greater bench: in a rebellion,
2842	When what's not meet, but what must be, was law,
2843	Then were they chosen: in a better hour,
2844	Let what is meet be said it must be meet,
2845	And throw their power i' the dust.
2846	
2847	BRUTUS	Manifest treason!
2848	
2849	SICINIUS	                  This a consul? no.
2850	
2851	BRUTUS	The aediles, ho!
2852	
2853	[Enter an AEdile]
2854	
2855	Let him be apprehended.
2856	
2857	SICINIUS	Go, call the people:
2858	
2859	[Exit AEdile]
2860	
2861	in whose name myself
2862	Attach thee as a traitorous innovator,
2863	A foe to the public weal: obey, I charge thee,
2864	And follow to thine answer.
2865	
2866	CORIOLANUS	Hence, old goat!
2867	
2868	Senators, &C	We'll surety him.
2869	
2870	COMINIUS	                  Aged sir, hands off.
2871	
2872	CORIOLANUS	Hence, rotten thing! or I shall shake thy bones
2873	Out of thy garments.
2874	
2875	SICINIUS	Help, ye citizens!
2876	
2877	[Enter a rabble of Citizens (Plebeians), with
2878	the AEdiles]
2879	
2880	MENENIUS	On both sides more respect.
2881	
2882	SICINIUS	Here's he that would take from you all your power.
2883	
2884	BRUTUS	Seize him, AEdiles!
2885	
2886	Citizens	Down with him! down with him!
2887	
2888	Senators, &C	Weapons, weapons, weapons!
2889	
2890	[They all bustle about CORIOLANUS, crying]
2891	
2892	'Tribunes!' 'Patricians!' 'Citizens!' 'What, ho!'
2893	'Sicinius!' 'Brutus!' 'Coriolanus!' 'Citizens!'
2894	'Peace, peace, peace!' 'Stay, hold, peace!'
2895	
2896	MENENIUS	What is about to be? I am out of breath;
2897	Confusion's near; I cannot speak. You, tribunes
2898	To the people! Coriolanus, patience!
2899	Speak, good Sicinius.
2900	
2901	SICINIUS	Hear me, people; peace!
2902	
2903	Citizens	Let's hear our tribune: peace Speak, speak, speak.
2904	
2905	SICINIUS	You are at point to lose your liberties:
2906	Marcius would have all from you; Marcius,
2907	Whom late you have named for consul.
2908	
2909	MENENIUS	Fie, fie, fie!
2910	This is the way to kindle, not to quench.
2911	
2912	First Senator	To unbuild the city and to lay all flat.
2913	
2914	SICINIUS	What is the city but the people?
2915	
2916	Citizens	True,
2917	The people are the city.
2918	
2919	BRUTUS	By the consent of all, we were establish'd
2920	The people's magistrates.
2921	
2922	Citizens	You so remain.
2923	
2924	MENENIUS	And so are like to do.
2925	
2926	COMINIUS	That is the way to lay the city flat;
2927	To bring the roof to the foundation,
2928	And bury all, which yet distinctly ranges,
2929	In heaps and piles of ruin.
2930	
2931	SICINIUS	This deserves death.
2932	
2933	BRUTUS	Or let us stand to our authority,
2934	Or let us lose it. We do here pronounce,
2935	Upon the part o' the people, in whose power
2936	We were elected theirs, Marcius is worthy
2937	Of present death.
2938	
2939	SICINIUS	                  Therefore lay hold of him;
2940	Bear him to the rock Tarpeian, and from thence
2941	Into destruction cast him.
2942	
2943	BRUTUS	AEdiles, seize him!
2944	
2945	Citizens	Yield, Marcius, yield!
2946	
2947	MENENIUS	Hear me one word;
2948	Beseech you, tribunes, hear me but a word.
2949	
2950	AEdile	Peace, peace!
2951	
2952	MENENIUS	[To BRUTUS]  Be that you seem, truly your
2953	country's friend,
2954	And temperately proceed to what you would
2955	Thus violently redress.
2956	
2957	BRUTUS	Sir, those cold ways,
2958	That seem like prudent helps, are very poisonous
2959	Where the disease is violent. Lay hands upon him,
2960	And bear him to the rock.
2961	
2962	CORIOLANUS	No, I'll die here.
2963	
2964	[Drawing his sword]
2965	
2966	There's some among you have beheld me fighting:
2967	Come, try upon yourselves what you have seen me.
2968	
2969	MENENIUS	Down with that sword! Tribunes, withdraw awhile.
2970	
2971	BRUTUS	Lay hands upon him.
2972	
2973	COMINIUS	Help Marcius, help,
2974	You that be noble; help him, young and old!
2975	
2976	Citizens	Down with him, down with him!
2977	
2978	[In this mutiny, the Tribunes, the AEdiles, and the
2979	People, are beat in]
2980	
2981	MENENIUS	Go, get you to your house; be gone, away!
2982	All will be naught else.
2983	
2984	Second Senator	Get you gone.
2985	
2986	COMINIUS	Stand fast;
2987	We have as many friends as enemies.
2988	
2989	MENENIUS	Sham it be put to that?
2990	
2991	First Senator	The gods forbid!
2992	I prithee, noble friend, home to thy house;
2993	Leave us to cure this cause.
2994	
2995	MENENIUS	For 'tis a sore upon us,
2996	You cannot tent yourself: be gone, beseech you.
2997	
2998	COMINIUS	Come, sir, along with us.
2999	
3000	CORIOLANUS	I would they were barbarians--as they are,
3001	Though in Rome litter'd--not Romans--as they are not,
3002	Though calved i' the porch o' the Capitol--
3003	
3004	MENENIUS	Be gone;
3005	Put not your worthy rage into your tongue;
3006	One time will owe another.
3007	
3008	CORIOLANUS	On fair ground
3009	I could beat forty of them.
3010	
3011	COMINIUS	I could myself
3012	Take up a brace o' the best of them; yea, the
3013	two tribunes:
3014	But now 'tis odds beyond arithmetic;
3015	And manhood is call'd foolery, when it stands
3016	Against a falling fabric. Will you hence,
3017	Before the tag return? whose rage doth rend
3018	Like interrupted waters and o'erbear
3019	What they are used to bear.
3020	
3021	MENENIUS	Pray you, be gone:
3022	I'll try whether my old wit be in request
3023	With those that have but little: this must be patch'd
3024	With cloth of any colour.
3025	
3026	COMINIUS	Nay, come away.
3027	
3028	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, and others]
3029	
3030	A Patrician	This man has marr'd his fortune.
3031	
3032	MENENIUS	His nature is too noble for the world:
3033	He would not flatter Neptune for his trident,
3034	Or Jove for's power to thunder. His heart's his mouth:
3035	What his breast forges, that his tongue must vent;
3036	And, being angry, does forget that ever
3037	He heard the name of death.
3038	
3039	[A noise within]
3040	
3041	Here's goodly work!
3042	
3043	Second Patrician	I would they were abed!
3044	
3045	MENENIUS	I would they were in Tiber! What the vengeance!
3046	Could he not speak 'em fair?
3047	
3048	[Re-enter BRUTUS and SICINIUS, with the rabble]
3049	
3050	SICINIUS	Where is this viper
3051	That would depopulate the city and
3052	Be every man himself?
3053	
3054	MENENIUS	You worthy tribunes,--
3055	
3056	SICINIUS	He shall be thrown down the Tarpeian rock
3057	With rigorous hands: he hath resisted law,
3058	And therefore law shall scorn him further trial
3059	Than the severity of the public power
3060	Which he so sets at nought.
3061	
3062	First Citizen	He shall well know
3063	The noble tribunes are the people's mouths,
3064	And we their hands.
3065	
3066	Citizens	He shall, sure on't.
3067	
3068	MENENIUS	Sir, sir,--
3069	
3070	SICINIUS	Peace!
3071	
3072	MENENIUS	Do not cry havoc, where you should but hunt
3073	With modest warrant.
3074	
3075	SICINIUS	Sir, how comes't that you
3076	Have holp to make this rescue?
3077	
3078	MENENIUS	Hear me speak:
3079	As I do know the consul's worthiness,
3080	So can I name his faults,--
3081	
3082	SICINIUS	Consul! what consul?
3083	
3084	MENENIUS	The consul Coriolanus.
3085	
3086	BRUTUS	He consul!
3087	
3088	Citizens	No, no, no, no, no.
3089	
3090	MENENIUS	If, by the tribunes' leave, and yours, good people,
3091	I may be heard, I would crave a word or two;
3092	The which shall turn you to no further harm
3093	Than so much loss of time.
3094	
3095	SICINIUS	Speak briefly then;
3096	For we are peremptory to dispatch
3097	This viperous traitor: to eject him hence
3098	Were but one danger, and to keep him here
3099	Our certain death: therefore it is decreed
3100	He dies to-night.
3101	
3102	MENENIUS	                  Now the good gods forbid
3103	That our renowned Rome, whose gratitude
3104	Towards her deserved children is enroll'd
3105	In Jove's own book, like an unnatural dam
3106	Should now eat up her own!
3107	
3108	SICINIUS	He's a disease that must be cut away.
3109	
3110	MENENIUS	O, he's a limb that has but a disease;
3111	Mortal, to cut it off; to cure it, easy.
3112	What has he done to Rome that's worthy death?
3113	Killing our enemies, the blood he hath lost--
3114	Which, I dare vouch, is more than that he hath,
3115	By many an ounce--he dropp'd it for his country;
3116	And what is left, to lose it by his country,
3117	Were to us all, that do't and suffer it,
3118	A brand to the end o' the world.
3119	
3120	SICINIUS	This is clean kam.
3121	
3122	BRUTUS	Merely awry: when he did love his country,
3123	It honour'd him.
3124	
3125	MENENIUS	                  The service of the foot
3126	Being once gangrened, is not then respected
3127	For what before it was.
3128	
3129	BRUTUS	We'll hear no more.
3130	Pursue him to his house, and pluck him thence:
3131	Lest his infection, being of catching nature,
3132	Spread further.
3133	
3134	MENENIUS	                  One word more, one word.
3135	This tiger-footed rage, when it shall find
3136	The harm of unscann'd swiftness, will too late
3137	Tie leaden pounds to's heels. Proceed by process;
3138	Lest parties, as he is beloved, break out,
3139	And sack great Rome with Romans.
3140	
3141	BRUTUS	If it were so,--
3142	
3143	SICINIUS	What do ye talk?
3144	Have we not had a taste of his obedience?
3145	Our aediles smote? ourselves resisted? Come.
3146	
3147	MENENIUS	Consider this: he has been bred i' the wars
3148	Since he could draw a sword, and is ill school'd
3149	In bolted language; meal and bran together
3150	He throws without distinction. Give me leave,
3151	I'll go to him, and undertake to bring him
3152	Where he shall answer, by a lawful form,
3153	In peace, to his utmost peril.
3154	
3155	First Senator	Noble tribunes,
3156	It is the humane way: the other course
3157	Will prove too bloody, and the end of it
3158	Unknown to the beginning.
3159	
3160	SICINIUS	Noble Menenius,
3161	Be you then as the people's officer.
3162	Masters, lay down your weapons.
3163	
3164	BRUTUS	Go not home.
3165	
3166	SICINIUS	Meet on the market-place. We'll attend you there:
3167	Where, if you bring not Marcius, we'll proceed
3168	In our first way.
3169	
3170	MENENIUS	                  I'll bring him to you.
3171	
3172	[To the Senators]
3173	
3174	Let me desire your company: he must come,
3175	Or what is worst will follow.
3176	
3177	First Senator	Pray you, let's to him.
3178	
3179	[Exeunt]

3187	ACT III
3188	
3189	
3190	
3191	SCENE II	A room in CORIOLANUS'S house.
3192	
3193	
3194	[Enter CORIOLANUS with Patricians]
3195	
3196	CORIOLANUS	Let them puff all about mine ears, present me
3197	Death on the wheel or at wild horses' heels,
3198	Or pile ten hills on the Tarpeian rock,
3199	That the precipitation might down stretch
3200	Below the beam of sight, yet will I still
3201	Be thus to them.
3202	
3203	A Patrician	You do the nobler.
3204	
3205	CORIOLANUS	I muse my mother
3206	Does not approve me further, who was wont
3207	To call them woollen vassals, things created
3208	To buy and sell with groats, to show bare heads
3209	In congregations, to yawn, be still and wonder,
3210	When one but of my ordinance stood up
3211	To speak of peace or war.
3212	
3213	[Enter VOLUMNIA]
3214	
3215	I talk of you:
3216	Why did you wish me milder? would you have me
3217	False to my nature? Rather say I play
3218	The man I am.
3219	
3220	VOLUMNIA	                  O, sir, sir, sir,
3221	I would have had you put your power well on,
3222	Before you had worn it out.
3223	
3224	CORIOLANUS	Let go.
3225	
3226	VOLUMNIA	You might have been enough the man you are,
3227	With striving less to be so; lesser had been
3228	The thwartings of your dispositions, if
3229	You had not show'd them how ye were disposed
3230	Ere they lack'd power to cross you.
3231	
3232	CORIOLANUS	Let them hang.
3233	
3234	A Patrician	Ay, and burn too.
3235	
3236	[Enter MENENIUS and Senators]
3237	
3238	MENENIUS	Come, come, you have been too rough, something
3239	too rough;
3240	You must return and mend it.
3241	
3242	First Senator	There's no remedy;
3243	Unless, by not so doing, our good city
3244	Cleave in the midst, and perish.
3245	
3246	VOLUMNIA	Pray, be counsell'd:
3247	I have a heart as little apt as yours,
3248	But yet a brain that leads my use of anger
3249	To better vantage.
3250	
3251	MENENIUS	                  Well said, noble woman?
3252	Before he should thus stoop to the herd, but that
3253	The violent fit o' the time craves it as physic
3254	For the whole state, I would put mine armour on,
3255	Which I can scarcely bear.
3256	
3257	CORIOLANUS	What must I do?
3258	
3259	MENENIUS	Return to the tribunes.
3260	
3261	CORIOLANUS	Well, what then? what then?
3262	
3263	MENENIUS	Repent what you have spoke.
3264	
3265	CORIOLANUS	For them! I cannot do it to the gods;
3266	Must I then do't to them?
3267	
3268	VOLUMNIA	You are too absolute;
3269	Though therein you can never be too noble,
3270	But when extremities speak. I have heard you say,
3271	Honour and policy, like unsever'd friends,
3272	I' the war do grow together: grant that, and tell me,
3273	In peace what each of them by the other lose,
3274	That they combine not there.
3275	
3276	CORIOLANUS	Tush, tush!
3277	
3278	MENENIUS	A good demand.
3279	
3280	VOLUMNIA	If it be honour in your wars to seem
3281	The same you are not, which, for your best ends,
3282	You adopt your policy, how is it less or worse,
3283	That it shall hold companionship in peace
3284	With honour, as in war, since that to both
3285	It stands in like request?
3286	
3287	CORIOLANUS	Why force you this?
3288	
3289	VOLUMNIA	Because that now it lies you on to speak
3290	To the people; not by your own instruction,
3291	Nor by the matter which your heart prompts you,
3292	But with such words that are but rooted in
3293	Your tongue, though but bastards and syllables
3294	Of no allowance to your bosom's truth.
3295	Now, this no more dishonours you at all
3296	Than to take in a town with gentle words,
3297	Which else would put you to your fortune and
3298	The hazard of much blood.
3299	I would dissemble with my nature where
3300	My fortunes and my friends at stake required
3301	I should do so in honour: I am in this,
3302	Your wife, your son, these senators, the nobles;
3303	And you will rather show our general louts
3304	How you can frown than spend a fawn upon 'em,
3305	For the inheritance of their loves and safeguard
3306	Of what that want might ruin.
3307	
3308	MENENIUS	Noble lady!
3309	Come, go with us; speak fair: you may salve so,
3310	Not what is dangerous present, but the loss
3311	Of what is past.
3312	
3313	VOLUMNIA	                  I prithee now, my son,
3314	Go to them, with this bonnet in thy hand;
3315	And thus far having stretch'd it--here be with them--
3316	Thy knee bussing the stones--for in such business
3317	Action is eloquence, and the eyes of the ignorant
3318	More learned than the ears--waving thy head,
3319	Which often, thus, correcting thy stout heart,
3320	Now humble as the ripest mulberry
3321	That will not hold the handling: or say to them,
3322	Thou art their soldier, and being bred in broils
3323	Hast not the soft way which, thou dost confess,
3324	Were fit for thee to use as they to claim,
3325	In asking their good loves, but thou wilt frame
3326	Thyself, forsooth, hereafter theirs, so far
3327	As thou hast power and person.
3328	
3329	MENENIUS	This but done,
3330	Even as she speaks, why, their hearts were yours;
3331	For they have pardons, being ask'd, as free
3332	As words to little purpose.
3333	
3334	VOLUMNIA	Prithee now,
3335	Go, and be ruled: although I know thou hadst rather
3336	Follow thine enemy in a fiery gulf
3337	Than flatter him in a bower. Here is Cominius.
3338	
3339	[Enter COMINIUS]
3340	
3341	COMINIUS	I have been i' the market-place; and, sir,'tis fit
3342	You make strong party, or defend yourself
3343	By calmness or by absence: all's in anger.
3344	
3345	MENENIUS	Only fair speech.
3346	
3347	COMINIUS	                  I think 'twill serve, if he
3348	Can thereto frame his spirit.
3349	
3350	VOLUMNIA	He must, and will
3351	Prithee now, say you will, and go about it.
3352	
3353	CORIOLANUS	Must I go show them my unbarbed sconce?
3354	Must I with base tongue give my noble heart
3355	A lie that it must bear? Well, I will do't:
3356	Yet, were there but this single plot to lose,
3357	This mould of Marcius, they to dust should grind it
3358	And throw't against the wind. To the market-place!
3359	You have put me now to such a part which never
3360	I shall discharge to the life.
3361	
3362	COMINIUS	Come, come, we'll prompt you.
3363	
3364	VOLUMNIA	I prithee now, sweet son, as thou hast said
3365	My praises made thee first a soldier, so,
3366	To have my praise for this, perform a part
3367	Thou hast not done before.
3368	
3369	CORIOLANUS	Well, I must do't:
3370	Away, my disposition, and possess me
3371	Some harlot's spirit! my throat of war be turn'd,
3372	Which quired with my drum, into a pipe
3373	Small as an eunuch, or the virgin voice
3374	That babies lulls asleep! the smiles of knaves
3375	Tent in my cheeks, and schoolboys' tears take up
3376	The glasses of my sight! a beggar's tongue
3377	Make motion through my lips, and my arm'd knees,
3378	Who bow'd but in my stirrup, bend like his
3379	That hath received an alms! I will not do't,
3380	Lest I surcease to honour mine own truth
3381	And by my body's action teach my mind
3382	A most inherent baseness.
3383	
3384	VOLUMNIA	At thy choice, then:
3385	To beg of thee, it is my more dishonour
3386	Than thou of them. Come all to ruin; let
3387	Thy mother rather feel thy pride than fear
3388	Thy dangerous stoutness, for I mock at death
3389	With as big heart as thou. Do as thou list
3390	Thy valiantness was mine, thou suck'dst it from me,
3391	But owe thy pride thyself.
3392	
3393	CORIOLANUS	Pray, be content:
3394	Mother, I am going to the market-place;
3395	Chide me no more. I'll mountebank their loves,
3396	Cog their hearts from them, and come home beloved
3397	Of all the trades in Rome. Look, I am going:
3398	Commend me to my wife. I'll return consul;
3399	Or never trust to what my tongue can do
3400	I' the way of flattery further.
3401	
3402	VOLUMNIA	Do your will.
3403	
3404	[Exit]
3405	
3406	COMINIUS	Away! the tribunes do attend you: arm yourself
3407	To answer mildly; for they are prepared
3408	With accusations, as I hear, more strong
3409	Than are upon you yet.
3410	
3411	CORIOLANUS	The word is 'mildly.' Pray you, let us go:
3412	Let them accuse me by invention, I
3413	Will answer in mine honour.
3414	
3415	MENENIUS	Ay, but mildly.
3416	
3417	CORIOLANUS	Well, mildly be it then. Mildly!
3418	
3419	[Exeunt]

3427	ACT III
3428	
3429	
3430	
3431	SCENE III	The same. The Forum.
3432	
3433	
3434	[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
3435	
3436	BRUTUS	In this point charge him home, that he affects
3437	Tyrannical power: if he evade us there,
3438	Enforce him with his envy to the people,
3439	And that the spoil got on the Antiates
3440	Was ne'er distributed.
3441	
3442	[Enter an AEdile]
3443	
3444	What, will he come?
3445	
3446	AEdile	He's coming.
3447	
3448	BRUTUS	How accompanied?
3449	
3450	AEdile	With old Menenius, and those senators
3451	That always favour'd him.
3452	
3453	SICINIUS	Have you a catalogue
3454	Of all the voices that we have procured
3455	Set down by the poll?
3456	
3457	AEdile	I have; 'tis ready.
3458	
3459	SICINIUS	Have you collected them by tribes?
3460	
3461	AEdile	I have.
3462	
3463	SICINIUS	Assemble presently the people hither;
3464	And when they bear me say 'It shall be so
3465	I' the right and strength o' the commons,' be it either
3466	For death, for fine, or banishment, then let them
3467	If I say fine, cry 'Fine;' if death, cry 'Death.'
3468	Insisting on the old prerogative
3469	And power i' the truth o' the cause.
3470	
3471	AEdile	I shall inform them.
3472	
3473	BRUTUS	And when such time they have begun to cry,
3474	Let them not cease, but with a din confused
3475	Enforce the present execution
3476	Of what we chance to sentence.
3477	
3478	AEdile	Very well.
3479	
3480	SICINIUS	Make them be strong and ready for this hint,
3481	When we shall hap to give 't them.
3482	
3483	BRUTUS	Go about it.
3484	
3485	[Exit AEdile]
3486	
3487	Put him to choler straight: he hath been used
3488	Ever to conquer, and to have his worth
3489	Of contradiction: being once chafed, he cannot
3490	Be rein'd again to temperance; then he speaks
3491	What's in his heart; and that is there which looks
3492	With us to break his neck.
3493	
3494	SICINIUS	Well, here he comes.
3495	
3496	[Enter CORIOLANUS, MENENIUS, and COMINIUS,
3497	with Senators and Patricians]
3498	
3499	MENENIUS	Calmly, I do beseech you.
3500	
3501	CORIOLANUS	Ay, as an ostler, that for the poorest piece
3502	Will bear the knave by the volume. The honour'd gods
3503	Keep Rome in safety, and the chairs of justice
3504	Supplied with worthy men! plant love among 's!
3505	Throng our large temples with the shows of peace,
3506	And not our streets with war!
3507	
3508	First Senator	Amen, amen.
3509	
3510	MENENIUS	A noble wish.
3511	
3512	[Re-enter AEdile, with Citizens]
3513	
3514	SICINIUS	Draw near, ye people.
3515	
3516	AEdile	List to your tribunes. Audience: peace, I say!
3517	
3518	CORIOLANUS	First, hear me speak.
3519	
3520	Both Tribunes	Well, say. Peace, ho!
3521	
3522	CORIOLANUS	Shall I be charged no further than this present?
3523	Must all determine here?
3524	
3525	SICINIUS	I do demand,
3526	If you submit you to the people's voices,
3527	Allow their officers and are content
3528	To suffer lawful censure for such faults
3529	As shall be proved upon you?
3530	
3531	CORIOLANUS	I am content.
3532	
3533	MENENIUS	Lo, citizens, he says he is content:
3534	The warlike service he has done, consider; think
3535	Upon the wounds his body bears, which show
3536	Like graves i' the holy churchyard.
3537	
3538	CORIOLANUS	Scratches with briers,
3539	Scars to move laughter only.
3540	
3541	MENENIUS	Consider further,
3542	That when he speaks not like a citizen,
3543	You find him like a soldier: do not take
3544	His rougher accents for malicious sounds,
3545	But, as I say, such as become a soldier,
3546	Rather than envy you.
3547	
3548	COMINIUS	Well, well, no more.
3549	
3550	CORIOLANUS	What is the matter
3551	That being pass'd for consul with full voice,
3552	I am so dishonour'd that the very hour
3553	You take it off again?
3554	
3555	SICINIUS	Answer to us.
3556	
3557	CORIOLANUS	Say, then: 'tis true, I ought so.
3558	
3559	SICINIUS	We charge you, that you have contrived to take
3560	From Rome all season'd office and to wind
3561	Yourself into a power tyrannical;
3562	For which you are a traitor to the people.
3563	
3564	CORIOLANUS	How! traitor!
3565	
3566	MENENIUS	                  Nay, temperately; your promise.
3567	
3568	CORIOLANUS	The fires i' the lowest hell fold-in the people!
3569	Call me their traitor! Thou injurious tribune!
3570	Within thine eyes sat twenty thousand deaths,
3571	In thy hand clutch'd as many millions, in
3572	Thy lying tongue both numbers, I would say
3573	'Thou liest' unto thee with a voice as free
3574	As I do pray the gods.
3575	
3576	SICINIUS	Mark you this, people?
3577	
3578	Citizens	To the rock, to the rock with him!
3579	
3580	SICINIUS	Peace!
3581	We need not put new matter to his charge:
3582	What you have seen him do and heard him speak,
3583	Beating your officers, cursing yourselves,
3584	Opposing laws with strokes and here defying
3585	Those whose great power must try him; even this,
3586	So criminal and in such capital kind,
3587	Deserves the extremest death.
3588	
3589	BRUTUS	But since he hath
3590	Served well for Rome,--
3591	
3592	CORIOLANUS	What do you prate of service?
3593	
3594	BRUTUS	I talk of that, that know it.
3595	
3596	CORIOLANUS	You?
3597	
3598	MENENIUS	Is this the promise that you made your mother?
3599	
3600	COMINIUS	Know, I pray you,--
3601	
3602	CORIOLANUS	I know no further:
3603	Let them pronounce the steep Tarpeian death,
3604	Vagabond exile, raying, pent to linger
3605	But with a grain a day, I would not buy
3606	Their mercy at the price of one fair word;
3607	Nor cheque my courage for what they can give,
3608	To have't with saying 'Good morrow.'
3609	
3610	SICINIUS	For that he has,
3611	As much as in him lies, from time to time
3612	Envied against the people, seeking means
3613	To pluck away their power, as now at last
3614	Given hostile strokes, and that not in the presence
3615	Of dreaded justice, but on the ministers
3616	That do distribute it; in the name o' the people
3617	And in the power of us the tribunes, we,
3618	Even from this instant, banish him our city,
3619	In peril of precipitation
3620	From off the rock Tarpeian never more
3621	To enter our Rome gates: i' the people's name,
3622	I say it shall be so.
3623	
3624	Citizens	It shall be so, it shall be so; let him away:
3625	He's banish'd, and it shall be so.
3626	
3627	COMINIUS	Hear me, my masters, and my common friends,--
3628	
3629	SICINIUS	He's sentenced; no more hearing.
3630	
3631	COMINIUS	Let me speak:
3632	I have been consul, and can show for Rome
3633	Her enemies' marks upon me. I do love
3634	My country's good with a respect more tender,
3635	More holy and profound, than mine own life,
3636	My dear wife's estimate, her womb's increase,
3637	And treasure of my loins; then if I would
3638	Speak that,--
3639	
3640	SICINIUS	                  We know your drift: speak what?
3641	
3642	BRUTUS	There's no more to be said, but he is banish'd,
3643	As enemy to the people and his country:
3644	It shall be so.
3645	
3646	Citizens	It shall be so, it shall be so.
3647	
3648	CORIOLANUS	You common cry of curs! whose breath I hate
3649	As reek o' the rotten fens, whose loves I prize
3650	As the dead carcasses of unburied men
3651	That do corrupt my air, I banish you;
3652	And here remain with your uncertainty!
3653	Let every feeble rumour shake your hearts!
3654	Your enemies, with nodding of their plumes,
3655	Fan you into despair! Have the power still
3656	To banish your defenders; till at length
3657	Your ignorance, which finds not till it feels,
3658	Making not reservation of yourselves,
3659	Still your own foes, deliver you as most
3660	Abated captives to some nation
3661	That won you without blows! Despising,
3662	For you, the city, thus I turn my back:
3663	There is a world elsewhere.
3664	
3665	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS, COMINIUS, MENENIUS, Senators,
3666	and Patricians]
3667	
3668	AEdile	The people's enemy is gone, is gone!
3669	
3670	Citizens	Our enemy is banish'd! he is gone! Hoo! hoo!
3671	
3672	[Shouting, and throwing up their caps]
3673	
3674	SICINIUS	Go, see him out at gates, and follow him,
3675	As he hath followed you, with all despite;
3676	Give him deserved vexation. Let a guard
3677	Attend us through the city.
3678	
3679	Citizens	Come, come; let's see him out at gates; come.
3680	The gods preserve our noble tribunes! Come.

3695	
3696	
3697	[Enter CORIOLANUS, VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, MENENIUS,
3698	COMINIUS, with the young Nobility of Rome]
3699	
3700	CORIOLANUS	Come, leave your tears: a brief farewell: the beast
3701	With many heads butts me away. Nay, mother,
3702	Where is your ancient courage? you were used
3703	To say extremity was the trier of spirits;
3704	That common chances common men could bear;
3705	That when the sea was calm all boats alike
3706	Show'd mastership in floating; fortune's blows,
3707	When most struck home, being gentle wounded, craves
3708	A noble cunning: you were used to load me
3709	With precepts that would make invincible
3710	The heart that conn'd them.
3711	
3712	VIRGILIA	O heavens! O heavens!
3713	
3714	CORIOLANUS	Nay! prithee, woman,--
3715	
3716	VOLUMNIA	Now the red pestilence strike all trades in Rome,
3717	And occupations perish!
3718	
3719	CORIOLANUS	What, what, what!
3720	I shall be loved when I am lack'd. Nay, mother.
3721	Resume that spirit, when you were wont to say,
3722	If you had been the wife of Hercules,
3723	Six of his labours you'ld have done, and saved
3724	Your husband so much sweat. Cominius,
3725	Droop not; adieu. Farewell, my wife, my mother:
3726	I'll do well yet. Thou old and true Menenius,
3727	Thy tears are salter than a younger man's,
3728	And venomous to thine eyes. My sometime general,
3729	I have seen thee stem, and thou hast oft beheld
3730	Heart-hardening spectacles; tell these sad women
3731	'Tis fond to wail inevitable strokes,
3732	As 'tis to laugh at 'em. My mother, you wot well
3733	My hazards still have been your solace: and
3734	Believe't not lightly--though I go alone,
3735	Like to a lonely dragon, that his fen
3736	Makes fear'd and talk'd of more than seen--your son
3737	Will or exceed the common or be caught
3738	With cautelous baits and practise.
3739	
3740	VOLUMNIA	My first son.
3741	Whither wilt thou go? Take good Cominius
3742	With thee awhile: determine on some course,
3743	More than a wild exposture to each chance
3744	That starts i' the way before thee.
3745	
3746	CORIOLANUS	O the gods!
3747	
3748	COMINIUS	I'll follow thee a month, devise with thee
3749	Where thou shalt rest, that thou mayst hear of us
3750	And we of thee: so if the time thrust forth
3751	A cause for thy repeal, we shall not send
3752	O'er the vast world to seek a single man,
3753	And lose advantage, which doth ever cool
3754	I' the absence of the needer.
3755	
3756	CORIOLANUS	Fare ye well:
3757	Thou hast years upon thee; and thou art too full
3758	Of the wars' surfeits, to go rove with one
3759	That's yet unbruised: bring me but out at gate.
3760	Come, my sweet wife, my dearest mother, and
3761	My friends of noble touch, when I am forth,
3762	Bid me farewell, and smile. I pray you, come.
3763	While I remain above the ground, you shall
3764	Hear from me still, and never of me aught
3765	But what is like me formerly.
3766	
3767	MENENIUS	That's worthily
3768	As any ear can hear. Come, let's not weep.
3769	If I could shake off but one seven years
3770	From these old arms and legs, by the good gods,
3771	I'ld with thee every foot.
3772	
3773	CORIOLANUS	Give me thy hand: Come.

3790	[Enter SICINIUS, BRUTUS, and an AEdile]
3791	
3792	SICINIUS	Bid them all home; he's gone, and we'll no further.
3793	The nobility are vex'd, whom we see have sided
3794	In his behalf.
3795	
3796	BRUTUS	                  Now we have shown our power,
3797	Let us seem humbler after it is done
3798	Than when it was a-doing.
3799	
3800	SICINIUS	Bid them home:
3801	Say their great enemy is gone, and they
3802	Stand in their ancient strength.
3803	
3804	BRUTUS	Dismiss them home.
3805	
3806	[Exit AEdile]
3807	
3808	Here comes his mother.
3809	
3810	SICINIUS	Let's not meet her.
3811	
3812	BRUTUS	Why?
3813	
3814	SICINIUS	They say she's mad.
3815	
3816	BRUTUS	They have ta'en note of us: keep on your way.
3817	
3818	[Enter VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, and MENENIUS]
3819	
3820	VOLUMNIA	O, ye're well met: the hoarded plague o' the gods
3821	Requite your love!
3822	
3823	MENENIUS	                  Peace, peace; be not so loud.
3824	
3825	VOLUMNIA	If that I could for weeping, you should hear,--
3826	Nay, and you shall hear some.
3827	
3828	[To BRUTUS]
3829	
3830	Will you be gone?
3831	
3832	VIRGILIA	[To SICINIUS]  You shall stay too: I would I had the power
3833	To say so to my husband.
3834	
3835	SICINIUS	Are you mankind?
3836	
3837	VOLUMNIA	Ay, fool; is that a shame? Note but this fool.
3838	Was not a man my father? Hadst thou foxship
3839	To banish him that struck more blows for Rome
3840	Than thou hast spoken words?
3841	
3842	SICINIUS	O blessed heavens!
3843	
3844	VOLUMNIA	More noble blows than ever thou wise words;
3845	And for Rome's good. I'll tell thee what; yet go:
3846	Nay, but thou shalt stay too: I would my son
3847	Were in Arabia, and thy tribe before him,
3848	His good sword in his hand.
3849	
3850	SICINIUS	What then?
3851	
3852	VIRGILIA	What then!
3853	He'ld make an end of thy posterity.
3854	
3855	VOLUMNIA	Bastards and all.
3856	Good man, the wounds that he does bear for Rome!
3857	
3858	MENENIUS	Come, come, peace.
3859	
3860	SICINIUS	I would he had continued to his country
3861	As he began, and not unknit himself
3862	The noble knot he made.
3863	
3864	BRUTUS	I would he had.
3865	
3866	VOLUMNIA	'I would he had'! 'Twas you incensed the rabble:
3867	Cats, that can judge as fitly of his worth
3868	As I can of those mysteries which heaven
3869	Will not have earth to know.
3870	
3871	BRUTUS	Pray, let us go.
3872	
3873	VOLUMNIA	Now, pray, sir, get you gone:
3874	You have done a brave deed. Ere you go, hear this:--
3875	As far as doth the Capitol exceed
3876	The meanest house in Rome, so far my son--
3877	This lady's husband here, this, do you see--
3878	Whom you have banish'd, does exceed you all.
3879	
3880	BRUTUS	Well, well, we'll leave you.
3881	
3882	SICINIUS	Why stay we to be baited
3883	With one that wants her wits?
3884	
3885	VOLUMNIA	Take my prayers with you.
3886	
3887	[Exeunt Tribunes]
3888	
3889	I would the gods had nothing else to do
3890	But to confirm my curses! Could I meet 'em
3891	But once a-day, it would unclog my heart
3892	Of what lies heavy to't.
3893	
3894	MENENIUS	You have told them home;
3895	And, by my troth, you have cause. You'll sup with me?
3896	
3897	VOLUMNIA	Anger's my meat; I sup upon myself,
3898	And so shall starve with feeding. Come, let's go:
3899	Leave this faint puling and lament as I do,
3900	In anger, Juno-like. Come, come, come.
3901	
3902	MENENIUS	Fie, fie, fie!

3915	
3916	SCENE III	A highway between Rome and Antium.
3917	
3918	
3919	[Enter a Roman and a Volsce, meeting]
3920	
3921	Roman	I know you well, sir, and you know
3922	me: your name, I think, is Adrian.
3923	
3924	Volsce	It is so, sir: truly, I have forgot you.
3925	
3926	Roman	I am a Roman; and my services are,
3927	as you are, against 'em: know you me yet?
3928	
3929	Volsce	Nicanor? no.
3930	
3931	Roman	The same, sir.
3932	
3933	Volsce	You had more beard when I last saw you; but your
3934	favour is well approved by your tongue. What's the
3935	news in Rome? I have a note from the Volscian state,
3936	to find you out there: you have well saved me a
3937	day's journey.
3938	
3939	Roman	There hath been in Rome strange insurrections; the
3940	people against the senators, patricians, and nobles.
3941	
3942	Volsce	Hath been! is it ended, then? Our state thinks not
3943	so: they are in a most warlike preparation, and
3944	hope to come upon them in the heat of their division.
3945	
3946	Roman	The main blaze of it is past, but a small thing
3947	would make it flame again: for the nobles receive
3948	so to heart the banishment of that worthy
3949	Coriolanus, that they are in a ripe aptness to take
3950	all power from the people and to pluck from them
3951	their tribunes for ever. This lies glowing, I can
3952	tell you, and is almost mature for the violent
3953	breaking out.
3954	
3955	Volsce	Coriolanus banished!
3956	
3957	Roman	Banished, sir.
3958	
3959	Volsce	You will be welcome with this intelligence, Nicanor.
3960	
3961	Roman	The day serves well for them now. I have heard it
3962	said, the fittest time to corrupt a man's wife is
3963	when she's fallen out with her husband. Your noble
3964	Tullus Aufidius will appear well in these wars, his
3965	great opposer, Coriolanus, being now in no request
3966	of his country.
3967	
3968	Volsce	He cannot choose. I am most fortunate, thus
3969	accidentally to encounter you: you have ended my
3970	business, and I will merrily accompany you home.
3971	
3972	Roman	I shall, between this and supper, tell you most
3973	strange things from Rome; all tending to the good of
3974	their adversaries. Have you an army ready, say you?
3975	
3976	Volsce	A most royal one; the centurions and their charges,
3977	distinctly billeted, already in the entertainment,
3978	and to be on foot at an hour's warning.
3979	
3980	Roman	I am joyful to hear of their readiness, and am the
3981	man, I think, that shall set them in present action.
3982	So, sir, heartily well met, and most glad of your company.
3983	
3984	Volsce	You take my part from me, sir; I have the most cause
3985	to be glad of yours.
3986	
3987	Roman	Well, let us go together.

4002	
4003	
4004	[Enter CORIOLANUS in mean apparel, disguised
4005	and muffled]
4006	
4007	CORIOLANUS	A goodly city is this Antium. City,
4008	'Tis I that made thy widows: many an heir
4009	Of these fair edifices 'fore my wars
4010	Have I heard groan and drop: then know me not,
4011	Lest that thy wives with spits and boys with stones
4012	In puny battle slay me.
4013	
4014	[Enter a Citizen]
4015	
4016	Save you, sir.
4017	
4018	Citizen	And you.
4019	
4020	CORIOLANUS	       Direct me, if it be your will,
4021	Where great Aufidius lies: is he in Antium?
4022	
4023	Citizen	He is, and feasts the nobles of the state
4024	At his house this night.
4025	
4026	CORIOLANUS	Which is his house, beseech you?
4027	
4028	Citizen	This, here before you.
4029	
4030	CORIOLANUS	Thank you, sir: farewell.
4031	
4032	[Exit Citizen]
4033	
4034	O world, thy slippery turns! Friends now fast sworn,
4035	Whose double bosoms seem to wear one heart,
4036	Whose house, whose bed, whose meal, and exercise,
4037	Are still together, who twin, as 'twere, in love
4038	Unseparable, shall within this hour,
4039	On a dissension of a doit, break out
4040	To bitterest enmity: so, fellest foes,
4041	Whose passions and whose plots have broke their sleep,
4042	To take the one the other, by some chance,
4043	Some trick not worth an egg, shall grow dear friends
4044	And interjoin their issues. So with me:
4045	My birth-place hate I, and my love's upon
4046	This enemy town. I'll enter: if he slay me,
4047	He does fair justice; if he give me way,
4048	I'll do his country service.

4065	[Music within. Enter a Servingman]
4066	
4067	First Servingman	Wine, wine, wine! What service
4068	is here! I think our fellows are asleep.
4069	
4070	[Exit]
4071	
4072	[Enter a second Servingman]
4073	
4074	Second Servingman	Where's Cotus? my master calls
4075	for him. Cotus!
4076	
4077	[Exit]
4078	
4079	[Enter CORIOLANUS]
4080	
4081	CORIOLANUS	A goodly house: the feast smells well; but I
4082	Appear not like a guest.
4083	
4084	[Re-enter the first Servingman]
4085	
4086	First Servingman	What would you have, friend? whence are you?
4087	Here's no place for you: pray, go to the door.
4088	
4089	[Exit]
4090	
4091	CORIOLANUS	I have deserved no better entertainment,
4092	In being Coriolanus.
4093	
4094	[Re-enter second Servingman]
4095	
4096	Second Servingman	Whence are you, sir? Has the porter his eyes in his
4097	head; that he gives entrance to such companions?
4098	Pray, get you out.
4099	
4100	CORIOLANUS	Away!
4101	
4102	Second Servingman	Away! get you away.
4103	
4104	CORIOLANUS	Now thou'rt troublesome.
4105	
4106	Second Servingman	Are you so brave? I'll have you talked with anon.
4107	
4108	[Enter a third Servingman. The first meets him]
4109	
4110	Third Servingman	What fellow's this?
4111	
4112	First Servingman	A strange one as ever I looked on: I cannot get him
4113	out of the house: prithee, call my master to him.
4114	
4115	[Retires]
4116	
4117	Third Servingman	What have you to do here, fellow? Pray you, avoid
4118	the house.
4119	
4120	CORIOLANUS	Let me but stand; I will not hurt your hearth.
4121	
4122	Third Servingman	What are you?
4123	
4124	CORIOLANUS	A gentleman.
4125	
4126	Third Servingman	A marvellous poor one.
4127	
4128	CORIOLANUS	True, so I am.
4129	
4130	Third Servingman	Pray you, poor gentleman, take up some other
4131	station; here's no place for you; pray you, avoid: come.
4132	
4133	CORIOLANUS	Follow your function, go, and batten on cold bits.
4134	
4135	[Pushes him away]
4136	
4137	Third Servingman	What, you will not? Prithee, tell my master what a
4138	strange guest he has here.
4139	
4140	Second Servingman	And I shall.
4141	
4142	[Exit]
4143	
4144	Third Servingman	Where dwellest thou?
4145	
4146	CORIOLANUS	Under the canopy.
4147	
4148	Third Servingman	Under the canopy!
4149	
4150	CORIOLANUS	Ay.
4151	
4152	Third Servingman	Where's that?
4153	
4154	CORIOLANUS	I' the city of kites and crows.
4155	
4156	Third Servingman	I' the city of kites and crows! What an ass it is!
4157	Then thou dwellest with daws too?
4158	
4159	CORIOLANUS	No, I serve not thy master.
4160	
4161	Third Servingman	How, sir! do you meddle with my master?
4162	
4163	CORIOLANUS	Ay; 'tis an honester service than to meddle with thy
4164	mistress. Thou pratest, and pratest; serve with thy
4165	trencher, hence!
4166	
4167	[Beats him away. Exit third Servingman]
4168	
4169	[Enter AUFIDIUS with the second Servingman]
4170	
4171	AUFIDIUS	Where is this fellow?
4172	
4173	Second Servingman	Here, sir: I'ld have beaten him like a dog, but for
4174	disturbing the lords within.
4175	
4176	[Retires]
4177	
4178	AUFIDIUS	Whence comest thou? what wouldst thou? thy name?
4179	Why speak'st not? speak, man: what's thy name?
4180	
4181	CORIOLANUS	If, Tullus,
4182	
4183	[Unmuffling]
4184	
4185	Not yet thou knowest me, and, seeing me, dost not
4186	Think me for the man I am, necessity
4187	Commands me name myself.
4188	
4189	AUFIDIUS	What is thy name?
4190	
4191	CORIOLANUS	A name unmusical to the Volscians' ears,
4192	And harsh in sound to thine.
4193	
4194	AUFIDIUS	Say, what's thy name?
4195	Thou hast a grim appearance, and thy face
4196	Bears a command in't; though thy tackle's torn.
4197	Thou show'st a noble vessel: what's thy name?
4198	
4199	CORIOLANUS	Prepare thy brow to frown: know'st
4200	thou me yet?
4201	
4202	AUFIDIUS	I know thee not: thy name?
4203	
4204	CORIOLANUS	My name is Caius Marcius, who hath done
4205	To thee particularly and to all the Volsces
4206	Great hurt and mischief; thereto witness may
4207	My surname, Coriolanus: the painful service,
4208	The extreme dangers and the drops of blood
4209	Shed for my thankless country are requited
4210	But with that surname; a good memory,
4211	And witness of the malice and displeasure
4212	Which thou shouldst bear me: only that name remains;
4213	The cruelty and envy of the people,
4214	Permitted by our dastard nobles, who
4215	Have all forsook me, hath devour'd the rest;
4216	And suffer'd me by the voice of slaves to be
4217	Whoop'd out of Rome. Now this extremity
4218	Hath brought me to thy hearth; not out of hope--
4219	Mistake me not--to save my life, for if
4220	I had fear'd death, of all the men i' the world
4221	I would have 'voided thee, but in mere spite,
4222	To be full quit of those my banishers,
4223	Stand I before thee here. Then if thou hast
4224	A heart of wreak in thee, that wilt revenge
4225	Thine own particular wrongs and stop those maims
4226	Of shame seen through thy country, speed
4227	thee straight,
4228	And make my misery serve thy turn: so use it
4229	That my revengeful services may prove
4230	As benefits to thee, for I will fight
4231	Against my canker'd country with the spleen
4232	Of all the under fiends. But if so be
4233	Thou darest not this and that to prove more fortunes
4234	Thou'rt tired, then, in a word, I also am
4235	Longer to live most weary, and present
4236	My throat to thee and to thy ancient malice;
4237	Which not to cut would show thee but a fool,
4238	Since I have ever follow'd thee with hate,
4239	Drawn tuns of blood out of thy country's breast,
4240	And cannot live but to thy shame, unless
4241	It be to do thee service.
4242	
4243	AUFIDIUS	O Marcius, Marcius!
4244	Each word thou hast spoke hath weeded from my heart
4245	A root of ancient envy. If Jupiter
4246	Should from yond cloud speak divine things,
4247	And say 'Tis true,' I'ld not believe them more
4248	Than thee, all noble Marcius. Let me twine
4249	Mine arms about that body, where against
4250	My grained ash an hundred times hath broke
4251	And scarr'd the moon with splinters: here I clip
4252	The anvil of my sword, and do contest
4253	As hotly and as nobly with thy love
4254	As ever in ambitious strength I did
4255	Contend against thy valour. Know thou first,
4256	I loved the maid I married; never man
4257	Sigh'd truer breath; but that I see thee here,
4258	Thou noble thing! more dances my rapt heart
4259	Than when I first my wedded mistress saw
4260	Bestride my threshold. Why, thou Mars! I tell thee,
4261	We have a power on foot; and I had purpose
4262	Once more to hew thy target from thy brawn,
4263	Or lose mine arm fort: thou hast beat me out
4264	Twelve several times, and I have nightly since
4265	Dreamt of encounters 'twixt thyself and me;
4266	We have been down together in my sleep,
4267	Unbuckling helms, fisting each other's throat,
4268	And waked half dead with nothing. Worthy Marcius,
4269	Had we no quarrel else to Rome, but that
4270	Thou art thence banish'd, we would muster all
4271	From twelve to seventy, and pouring war
4272	Into the bowels of ungrateful Rome,
4273	Like a bold flood o'er-bear. O, come, go in,
4274	And take our friendly senators by the hands;
4275	Who now are here, taking their leaves of me,
4276	Who am prepared against your territories,
4277	Though not for Rome itself.
4278	
4279	CORIOLANUS	You bless me, gods!
4280	
4281	AUFIDIUS	Therefore, most absolute sir, if thou wilt have
4282	The leading of thine own revenges, take
4283	The one half of my commission; and set down--
4284	As best thou art experienced, since thou know'st
4285	Thy country's strength and weakness,--thine own ways;
4286	Whether to knock against the gates of Rome,
4287	Or rudely visit them in parts remote,
4288	To fright them, ere destroy. But come in:
4289	Let me commend thee first to those that shall
4290	Say yea to thy desires. A thousand welcomes!
4291	And more a friend than e'er an enemy;
4292	Yet, Marcius, that was much. Your hand: most welcome!
4293	
4294	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS. The two
4295	Servingmen come forward]
4296	
4297	First Servingman	Here's a strange alteration!
4298	
4299	Second Servingman	By my hand, I had thought to have strucken him with
4300	a cudgel; and yet my mind gave me his clothes made a
4301	false report of him.
4302	
4303	First Servingman	What an arm he has! he turned me about with his
4304	finger and his thumb, as one would set up a top.
4305	
4306	Second Servingman	Nay, I knew by his face that there was something in
4307	him: he had, sir, a kind of face, methought,--I
4308	cannot tell how to term it.
4309	
4310	First Servingman	He had so; looking as it were--would I were hanged,
4311	but I thought there was more in him than I could think.
4312	
4313	Second Servingman	So did I, I'll be sworn: he is simply the rarest
4314	man i' the world.
4315	
4316	First Servingman	I think he is: but a greater soldier than he you wot on.
4317	
4318	Second Servingman	Who, my master?
4319	
4320	First Servingman	Nay, it's no matter for that.
4321	
4322	Second Servingman	Worth six on him.
4323	
4324	First Servingman	Nay, not so neither: but I take him to be the
4325	greater soldier.
4326	
4327	Second Servingman	Faith, look you, one cannot tell how to say that:
4328	for the defence of a town, our general is excellent.
4329	
4330	First Servingman	Ay, and for an assault too.
4331	
4332	[Re-enter third Servingman]
4333	
4334	Third Servingman	O slaves, I can tell you news,-- news, you rascals!
4335	
4336	
4337	First Servingman	|
4338	|  What, what, what? let's partake.
4339	Second Servingman	|
4340	
4341	
4342	Third Servingman	I would not be a Roman, of all nations; I had as
4343	lieve be a condemned man.
4344	
4345	
4346	First Servingman	|
4347	|  Wherefore? wherefore?
4348	Second Servingman	|
4349	
4350	
4351	Third Servingman	Why, here's he that was wont to thwack our general,
4352	Caius Marcius.
4353	
4354	First Servingman	Why do you say 'thwack our general '?
4355	
4356	Third Servingman	I do not say 'thwack our general;' but he was always
4357	good enough for him.
4358	
4359	Second Servingman	Come, we are fellows and friends: he was ever too
4360	hard for him; I have heard him say so himself.
4361	
4362	First Servingman	He was too hard for him directly, to say the troth
4363	on't: before Corioli he scotched him and notched
4364	him like a carbon ado.
4365	
4366	Second Servingman	An he had been cannibally given, he might have
4367	broiled and eaten him too.
4368	
4369	First Servingman	But, more of thy news?
4370	
4371	Third Servingman	Why, he is so made on here within, as if he were son
4372	and heir to Mars; set at upper end o' the table; no
4373	question asked him by any of the senators, but they
4374	stand bald before him: our general himself makes a
4375	mistress of him: sanctifies himself with's hand and
4376	turns up the white o' the eye to his discourse. But
4377	the bottom of the news is that our general is cut i'
4378	the middle and but one half of what he was
4379	yesterday; for the other has half, by the entreaty
4380	and grant of the whole table. He'll go, he says,
4381	and sowl the porter of Rome gates by the ears: he
4382	will mow all down before him, and leave his passage polled.
4383	
4384	Second Servingman	And he's as like to do't as any man I can imagine.
4385	
4386	Third Servingman	Do't! he will do't; for, look you, sir, he has as
4387	many friends as enemies; which friends, sir, as it
4388	were, durst not, look you, sir, show themselves, as
4389	we term it, his friends whilst he's in directitude.
4390	
4391	First Servingman	Directitude! what's that?
4392	
4393	Third Servingman	But when they shall see, sir, his crest up again,
4394	and the man in blood, they will out of their
4395	burrows, like conies after rain, and revel all with
4396	him.
4397	
4398	First Servingman	But when goes this forward?
4399	
4400	Third Servingman	To-morrow; to-day; presently; you shall have the
4401	drum struck up this afternoon: 'tis, as it were, a
4402	parcel of their feast, and to be executed ere they
4403	wipe their lips.
4404	
4405	Second Servingman	Why, then we shall have a stirring world again.
4406	This peace is nothing, but to rust iron, increase
4407	tailors, and breed ballad-makers.
4408	
4409	First Servingman	Let me have war, say I; it exceeds peace as far as
4410	day does night; it's spritely, waking, audible, and
4411	full of vent. Peace is a very apoplexy, lethargy;
4412	mulled, deaf, sleepy, insensible; a getter of more
4413	bastard children than war's a destroyer of men.
4414	
4415	Second Servingman	'Tis so: and as war, in some sort, may be said to
4416	be a ravisher, so it cannot be denied but peace is a
4417	great maker of cuckolds.
4418	
4419	First Servingman	Ay, and it makes men hate one another.
4420	
4421	Third Servingman	Reason; because they then less need one another.
4422	The wars for my money. I hope to see Romans as cheap
4423	as Volscians. They are rising, they are rising.
4424	
4425	All	In, in, in, in!

4440	
4441	
4442	[Enter SICINIUS and BRUTUS]
4443	
4444	SICINIUS	We hear not of him, neither need we fear him;
4445	His remedies are tame i' the present peace
4446	And quietness of the people, which before
4447	Were in wild hurry. Here do we make his friends
4448	Blush that the world goes well, who rather had,
4449	Though they themselves did suffer by't, behold
4450	Dissentious numbers pestering streets than see
4451	Our tradesmen with in their shops and going
4452	About their functions friendly.
4453	
4454	BRUTUS	We stood to't in good time.
4455	
4456	[Enter MENENIUS]
4457	
4458	Is this Menenius?
4459	
4460	SICINIUS	'Tis he,'tis he: O, he is grown most kind of late.
4461	
4462	Both Tribunes	Hail sir!
4463	
4464	MENENIUS	        Hail to you both!
4465	
4466	SICINIUS	Your Coriolanus
4467	Is not much miss'd, but with his friends:
4468	The commonwealth doth stand, and so would do,
4469	Were he more angry at it.
4470	
4471	MENENIUS	All's well; and might have been much better, if
4472	He could have temporized.
4473	
4474	SICINIUS	Where is he, hear you?
4475	
4476	MENENIUS	Nay, I hear nothing: his mother and his wife
4477	Hear nothing from him.
4478	
4479	[Enter three or four Citizens]
4480	
4481	Citizens	The gods preserve you both!
4482	
4483	SICINIUS	God-den, our neighbours.
4484	
4485	BRUTUS	God-den to you all, god-den to you all.
4486	
4487	First Citizen	Ourselves, our wives, and children, on our knees,
4488	Are bound to pray for you both.
4489	
4490	SICINIUS	Live, and thrive!
4491	
4492	BRUTUS	Farewell, kind neighbours: we wish'd Coriolanus
4493	Had loved you as we did.
4494	
4495	Citizens	Now the gods keep you!
4496	
4497	Both Tribunes	Farewell, farewell.
4498	
4499	[Exeunt Citizens]
4500	
4501	SICINIUS	This is a happier and more comely time
4502	Than when these fellows ran about the streets,
4503	Crying confusion.
4504	
4505	BRUTUS	                  Caius Marcius was
4506	A worthy officer i' the war; but insolent,
4507	O'ercome with pride, ambitious past all thinking,
4508	Self-loving,--
4509	
4510	SICINIUS	                  And affecting one sole throne,
4511	Without assistance.
4512	
4513	MENENIUS	I think not so.
4514	
4515	SICINIUS	We should by this, to all our lamentation,
4516	If he had gone forth consul, found it so.
4517	
4518	BRUTUS	The gods have well prevented it, and Rome
4519	Sits safe and still without him.
4520	
4521	[Enter an AEdile]
4522	
4523	AEdile	Worthy tribunes,
4524	There is a slave, whom we have put in prison,
4525	Reports, the Volsces with two several powers
4526	Are enter'd in the Roman territories,
4527	And with the deepest malice of the war
4528	Destroy what lies before 'em.
4529	
4530	MENENIUS	'Tis Aufidius,
4531	Who, hearing of our Marcius' banishment,
4532	Thrusts forth his horns again into the world;
4533	Which were inshell'd when Marcius stood for Rome,
4534	And durst not once peep out.
4535	
4536	SICINIUS	Come, what talk you
4537	Of Marcius?
4538	
4539	BRUTUS	Go see this rumourer whipp'd. It cannot be
4540	The Volsces dare break with us.
4541	
4542	MENENIUS	Cannot be!
4543	We have record that very well it can,
4544	And three examples of the like have been
4545	Within my age. But reason with the fellow,
4546	Before you punish him, where he heard this,
4547	Lest you shall chance to whip your information
4548	And beat the messenger who bids beware
4549	Of what is to be dreaded.
4550	
4551	SICINIUS	Tell not me:
4552	I know this cannot be.
4553	
4554	BRUTUS	Not possible.
4555	
4556	[Enter a Messenger]
4557	
4558	Messenger	The nobles in great earnestness are going
4559	All to the senate-house: some news is come
4560	That turns their countenances.
4561	
4562	SICINIUS	'Tis this slave;--
4563	Go whip him, 'fore the people's eyes:--his raising;
4564	Nothing but his report.
4565	
4566	Messenger	Yes, worthy sir,
4567	The slave's report is seconded; and more,
4568	More fearful, is deliver'd.
4569	
4570	SICINIUS	What more fearful?
4571	
4572	Messenger	It is spoke freely out of many mouths--
4573	How probable I do not know--that Marcius,
4574	Join'd with Aufidius, leads a power 'gainst Rome,
4575	And vows revenge as spacious as between
4576	The young'st and oldest thing.
4577	
4578	SICINIUS	This is most likely!
4579	
4580	BRUTUS	Raised only, that the weaker sort may wish
4581	Good Marcius home again.
4582	
4583	SICINIUS	The very trick on't.
4584	
4585	MENENIUS	This is unlikely:
4586	He and Aufidius can no more atone
4587	Than violentest contrariety.
4588	
4589	[Enter a second Messenger]
4590	
4591	Second Messenger	You are sent for to the senate:
4592	A fearful army, led by Caius Marcius
4593	Associated with Aufidius, rages
4594	Upon our territories; and have already
4595	O'erborne their way, consumed with fire, and took
4596	What lay before them.
4597	
4598	[Enter COMINIUS]
4599	
4600	COMINIUS	O, you have made good work!
4601	
4602	MENENIUS	What news? what news?
4603	
4604	COMINIUS	You have holp to ravish your own daughters and
4605	To melt the city leads upon your pates,
4606	To see your wives dishonour'd to your noses,--
4607	
4608	MENENIUS	What's the news? what's the news?
4609	
4610	COMINIUS	Your temples burned in their cement, and
4611	Your franchises, whereon you stood, confined
4612	Into an auger's bore.
4613	
4614	MENENIUS	Pray now, your news?
4615	You have made fair work, I fear me.--Pray, your news?--
4616	If Marcius should be join'd with Volscians,--
4617	
4618	COMINIUS	If!
4619	He is their god: he leads them like a thing
4620	Made by some other deity than nature,
4621	That shapes man better; and they follow him,
4622	Against us brats, with no less confidence
4623	Than boys pursuing summer butterflies,
4624	Or butchers killing flies.
4625	
4626	MENENIUS	You have made good work,
4627	You and your apron-men; you that stood so up much
4628	on the voice of occupation and
4629	The breath of garlic-eaters!
4630	
4631	COMINIUS	He will shake
4632	Your Rome about your ears.
4633	
4634	MENENIUS	As Hercules
4635	Did shake down mellow fruit.
4636	You have made fair work!
4637	
4638	BRUTUS	But is this true, sir?
4639	
4640	COMINIUS	Ay; and you'll look pale
4641	Before you find it other. All the regions
4642	Do smilingly revolt; and who resist
4643	Are mock'd for valiant ignorance,
4644	And perish constant fools. Who is't can blame him?
4645	Your enemies and his find something in him.
4646	
4647	MENENIUS	We are all undone, unless
4648	The noble man have mercy.
4649	
4650	COMINIUS	Who shall ask it?
4651	The tribunes cannot do't for shame; the people
4652	Deserve such pity of him as the wolf
4653	Does of the shepherds: for his best friends, if they
4654	Should say 'Be good to Rome,' they charged him even
4655	As those should do that had deserved his hate,
4656	And therein show'd like enemies.
4657	
4658	MENENIUS	'Tis true:
4659	If he were putting to my house the brand
4660	That should consume it, I have not the face
4661	To say 'Beseech you, cease.' You have made fair hands,
4662	You and your crafts! you have crafted fair!
4663	
4664	COMINIUS	You have brought
4665	A trembling upon Rome, such as was never
4666	So incapable of help.
4667	
4668	Both Tribunes	Say not we brought it.
4669	
4670	MENENIUS	How! Was it we? we loved him but, like beasts
4671	And cowardly nobles, gave way unto your clusters,
4672	Who did hoot him out o' the city.
4673	
4674	COMINIUS	But I fear
4675	They'll roar him in again. Tullus Aufidius,
4676	The second name of men, obeys his points
4677	As if he were his officer: desperation
4678	Is all the policy, strength and defence,
4679	That Rome can make against them.
4680	
4681	[Enter a troop of Citizens]
4682	
4683	MENENIUS	Here come the clusters.
4684	And is Aufidius with him? You are they
4685	That made the air unwholesome, when you cast
4686	Your stinking greasy caps in hooting at
4687	Coriolanus' exile. Now he's coming;
4688	And not a hair upon a soldier's head
4689	Which will not prove a whip: as many coxcombs
4690	As you threw caps up will he tumble down,
4691	And pay you for your voices. 'Tis no matter;
4692	if he could burn us all into one coal,
4693	We have deserved it.
4694	
4695	Citizens	Faith, we hear fearful news.
4696	
4697	First Citizen	For mine own part,
4698	When I said, banish him, I said 'twas pity.
4699	
4700	Second Citizen	And so did I.
4701	
4702	Third Citizen	And so did I; and, to say the truth, so did very
4703	many of us: that we did, we did for the best; and
4704	though we willingly consented to his banishment, yet
4705	it was against our will.
4706	
4707	COMINIUS	Ye re goodly things, you voices!
4708	
4709	MENENIUS	You have made
4710	Good work, you and your cry! Shall's to the Capitol?
4711	
4712	COMINIUS	O, ay, what else?
4713	
4714	[Exeunt COMINIUS and MENENIUS]
4715	
4716	SICINIUS	Go, masters, get you home; be not dismay'd:
4717	These are a side that would be glad to have
4718	This true which they so seem to fear. Go home,
4719	And show no sign of fear.
4720	
4721	First Citizen	The gods be good to us! Come, masters, let's home.
4722	I ever said we were i' the wrong when we banished
4723	him.
4724	
4725	Second Citizen	So did we all. But, come, let's home.
4726	
4727	[Exeunt Citizens]
4728	
4729	BRUTUS	I do not like this news.
4730	
4731	SICINIUS	Nor I.
4732	
4733	BRUTUS	Let's to the Capitol. Would half my wealth
4734	Would buy this for a lie!
4735	
4736	SICINIUS	Pray, let us go.

4751	
4752	
4753	[Enter AUFIDIUS and his Lieutenant]
4754	
4755	AUFIDIUS	Do they still fly to the Roman?
4756	
4757	Lieutenant	I do not know what witchcraft's in him, but
4758	Your soldiers use him as the grace 'fore meat,
4759	Their talk at table, and their thanks at end;
4760	And you are darken'd in this action, sir,
4761	Even by your own.
4762	
4763	AUFIDIUS	                  I cannot help it now,
4764	Unless, by using means, I lame the foot
4765	Of our design. He bears himself more proudlier,
4766	Even to my person, than I thought he would
4767	When first I did embrace him: yet his nature
4768	In that's no changeling; and I must excuse
4769	What cannot be amended.
4770	
4771	Lieutenant	Yet I wish, sir,--
4772	I mean for your particular,--you had not
4773	Join'd in commission with him; but either
4774	Had borne the action of yourself, or else
4775	To him had left it solely.
4776	
4777	AUFIDIUS	I understand thee well; and be thou sure,
4778	when he shall come to his account, he knows not
4779	What I can urge against him. Although it seems,
4780	And so he thinks, and is no less apparent
4781	To the vulgar eye, that he bears all things fairly.
4782	And shows good husbandry for the Volscian state,
4783	Fights dragon-like, and does achieve as soon
4784	As draw his sword; yet he hath left undone
4785	That which shall break his neck or hazard mine,
4786	Whene'er we come to our account.
4787	
4788	Lieutenant	Sir, I beseech you, think you he'll carry Rome?
4789	
4790	AUFIDIUS	All places yield to him ere he sits down;
4791	And the nobility of Rome are his:
4792	The senators and patricians love him too:
4793	The tribunes are no soldiers; and their people
4794	Will be as rash in the repeal, as hasty
4795	To expel him thence. I think he'll be to Rome
4796	As is the osprey to the fish, who takes it
4797	By sovereignty of nature. First he was
4798	A noble servant to them; but he could not
4799	Carry his honours even: whether 'twas pride,
4800	Which out of daily fortune ever taints
4801	The happy man; whether defect of judgment,
4802	To fail in the disposing of those chances
4803	Which he was lord of; or whether nature,
4804	Not to be other than one thing, not moving
4805	From the casque to the cushion, but commanding peace
4806	Even with the same austerity and garb
4807	As he controll'd the war; but one of these--
4808	As he hath spices of them all, not all,
4809	For I dare so far free him--made him fear'd,
4810	So hated, and so banish'd: but he has a merit,
4811	To choke it in the utterance. So our virtues
4812	Lie in the interpretation of the time:
4813	And power, unto itself most commendable,
4814	Hath not a tomb so evident as a chair
4815	To extol what it hath done.
4816	One fire drives out one fire; one nail, one nail;
4817	Rights by rights falter, strengths by strengths do fail.
4818	Come, let's away. When, Caius, Rome is thine,
4819	Thou art poor'st of all; then shortly art thou mine.

4836	[Enter MENENIUS, COMINIUS, SICINIUS, BRUTUS,
4837	and others]
4838	
4839	MENENIUS	No, I'll not go: you hear what he hath said
4840	Which was sometime his general; who loved him
4841	In a most dear particular. He call'd me father:
4842	But what o' that? Go, you that banish'd him;
4843	A mile before his tent fall down, and knee
4844	The way into his mercy: nay, if he coy'd
4845	To hear Cominius speak, I'll keep at home.
4846	
4847	COMINIUS	He would not seem to know me.
4848	
4849	MENENIUS	Do you hear?
4850	
4851	COMINIUS	Yet one time he did call me by my name:
4852	I urged our old acquaintance, and the drops
4853	That we have bled together. Coriolanus
4854	He would not answer to: forbad all names;
4855	He was a kind of nothing, titleless,
4856	Till he had forged himself a name o' the fire
4857	Of burning Rome.
4858	
4859	MENENIUS	Why, so: you have made good work!
4860	A pair of tribunes that have rack'd for Rome,
4861	To make coals cheap,--a noble memory!
4862	
4863	COMINIUS	I minded him how royal 'twas to pardon
4864	When it was less expected: he replied,
4865	It was a bare petition of a state
4866	To one whom they had punish'd.
4867	
4868	MENENIUS	Very well:
4869	Could he say less?
4870	
4871	COMINIUS	I offer'd to awaken his regard
4872	For's private friends: his answer to me was,
4873	He could not stay to pick them in a pile
4874	Of noisome musty chaff: he said 'twas folly,
4875	For one poor grain or two, to leave unburnt,
4876	And still to nose the offence.
4877	
4878	MENENIUS	For one poor grain or two!
4879	I am one of those; his mother, wife, his child,
4880	And this brave fellow too, we are the grains:
4881	You are the musty chaff; and you are smelt
4882	Above the moon: we must be burnt for you.
4883	
4884	SICINIUS	Nay, pray, be patient: if you refuse your aid
4885	In this so never-needed help, yet do not
4886	Upbraid's with our distress. But, sure, if you
4887	Would be your country's pleader, your good tongue,
4888	More than the instant army we can make,
4889	Might stop our countryman.
4890	
4891	MENENIUS	No, I'll not meddle.
4892	
4893	SICINIUS	Pray you, go to him.
4894	
4895	MENENIUS	What should I do?
4896	
4897	BRUTUS	Only make trial what your love can do
4898	For Rome, towards Marcius.
4899	
4900	MENENIUS	Well, and say that Marcius
4901	Return me, as Cominius is return'd,
4902	Unheard; what then?
4903	But as a discontented friend, grief-shot
4904	With his unkindness? say't be so?
4905	
4906	SICINIUS	Yet your good will
4907	must have that thanks from Rome, after the measure
4908	As you intended well.
4909	
4910	MENENIUS	I'll undertake 't:
4911	I think he'll hear me. Yet, to bite his lip
4912	And hum at good Cominius, much unhearts me.
4913	He was not taken well; he had not dined:
4914	The veins unfill'd, our blood is cold, and then
4915	We pout upon the morning, are unapt
4916	To give or to forgive; but when we have stuff'd
4917	These and these conveyances of our blood
4918	With wine and feeding, we have suppler souls
4919	Than in our priest-like fasts: therefore I'll watch him
4920	Till he be dieted to my request,
4921	And then I'll set upon him.
4922	
4923	BRUTUS	You know the very road into his kindness,
4924	And cannot lose your way.
4925	
4926	MENENIUS	Good faith, I'll prove him,
4927	Speed how it will. I shall ere long have knowledge
4928	Of my success.
4929	
4930	[Exit]
4931	
4932	COMINIUS	                  He'll never hear him.
4933	
4934	SICINIUS	Not?
4935	
4936	COMINIUS	I tell you, he does sit in gold, his eye
4937	Red as 'twould burn Rome; and his injury
4938	The gaoler to his pity. I kneel'd before him;
4939	'Twas very faintly he said 'Rise;' dismiss'd me
4940	Thus, with his speechless hand: what he would do,
4941	He sent in writing after me; what he would not,
4942	Bound with an oath to yield to his conditions:
4943	So that all hope is vain.
4944	Unless his noble mother, and his wife;
4945	Who, as I hear, mean to solicit him
4946	For mercy to his country. Therefore, let's hence,
4947	And with our fair entreaties haste them on.

4957	ACT V
4958	
4959	
4960	
4961	SCENE II	Entrance of the Volscian camp before Rome.
4962	Two Sentinels on guard.
4963	
4964	
4965	[Enter to them, MENENIUS]
4966	
4967	First Senator	Stay: whence are you?
4968	
4969	Second Senator	Stand, and go back.
4970	
4971	MENENIUS	You guard like men; 'tis well: but, by your leave,
4972	I am an officer of state, and come
4973	To speak with Coriolanus.
4974	
4975	First Senator	From whence?
4976	
4977	MENENIUS	From Rome.
4978	
4979	First Senator	You may not pass, you must return: our general
4980	Will no more hear from thence.
4981	
4982	Second Senator	You'll see your Rome embraced with fire before
4983	You'll speak with Coriolanus.
4984	
4985	MENENIUS	Good my friends,
4986	If you have heard your general talk of Rome,
4987	And of his friends there, it is lots to blanks,
4988	My name hath touch'd your ears it is Menenius.
4989	
4990	First Senator	Be it so; go back: the virtue of your name
4991	Is not here passable.
4992	
4993	MENENIUS	I tell thee, fellow,
4994	The general is my lover: I have been
4995	The book of his good acts, whence men have read
4996	His name unparallel'd, haply amplified;
4997	For I have ever verified my friends,
4998	Of whom he's chief, with all the size that verity
4999	Would without lapsing suffer: nay, sometimes,
5000	Like to a bowl upon a subtle ground,
5001	I have tumbled past the throw; and in his praise
5002	Have almost stamp'd the leasing: therefore, fellow,
5003	I must have leave to pass.
5004	
5005	First Senator	Faith, sir, if you had told as many lies in his
5006	behalf as you have uttered words in your own, you
5007	should not pass here; no, though it were as virtuous
5008	to lie as to live chastely. Therefore, go back.
5009	
5010	MENENIUS	Prithee, fellow, remember my name is Menenius,
5011	always factionary on the party of your general.
5012	
5013	Second Senator	Howsoever you have been his liar, as you say you
5014	have, I am one that, telling true under him, must
5015	say, you cannot pass. Therefore, go back.
5016	
5017	MENENIUS	Has he dined, canst thou tell? for I would not
5018	speak with him till after dinner.
5019	
5020	First Senator	You are a Roman, are you?
5021	
5022	MENENIUS	I am, as thy general is.
5023	
5024	First Senator	Then you should hate Rome, as he does. Can you,
5025	when you have pushed out your gates the very
5026	defender of them, and, in a violent popular
5027	ignorance, given your enemy your shield, think to
5028	front his revenges with the easy groans of old
5029	women, the virginal palms of your daughters, or with
5030	the palsied intercession of such a decayed dotant as
5031	you seem to be? Can you think to blow out the
5032	intended fire your city is ready to flame in, with
5033	such weak breath as this? No, you are deceived;
5034	therefore, back to Rome, and prepare for your
5035	execution: you are condemned, our general has sworn
5036	you out of reprieve and pardon.
5037	
5038	MENENIUS	Sirrah, if thy captain knew I were here, he would
5039	use me with estimation.
5040	
5041	Second Senator	Come, my captain knows you not.
5042	
5043	MENENIUS	I mean, thy general.
5044	
5045	First Senator	My general cares not for you. Back, I say, go; lest
5046	I let forth your half-pint of blood; back,--that's
5047	the utmost of your having: back.
5048	
5049	MENENIUS	Nay, but, fellow, fellow,--
5050	
5051	[Enter CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS]
5052	
5053	CORIOLANUS	What's the matter?
5054	
5055	MENENIUS	Now, you companion, I'll say an errand for you:
5056	You shall know now that I am in estimation; you shall
5057	perceive that a Jack guardant cannot office me from
5058	my son Coriolanus: guess, but by my entertainment
5059	with him, if thou standest not i' the state of
5060	hanging, or of some death more long in
5061	spectatorship, and crueller in suffering; behold now
5062	presently, and swoon for what's to come upon thee.
5063	
5064	[To CORIOLANUS]
5065	
5066	The glorious gods sit in hourly synod about thy
5067	particular prosperity, and love thee no worse than
5068	thy old father Menenius does! O my son, my son!
5069	thou art preparing fire for us; look thee, here's
5070	water to quench it. I was hardly moved to come to
5071	thee; but being assured none but myself could move
5072	thee, I have been blown out of your gates with
5073	sighs; and conjure thee to pardon Rome, and thy
5074	petitionary countrymen. The good gods assuage thy
5075	wrath, and turn the dregs of it upon this varlet
5076	here,--this, who, like a block, hath denied my
5077	access to thee.
5078	
5079	CORIOLANUS	Away!
5080	
5081	MENENIUS	How! away!
5082	
5083	CORIOLANUS	Wife, mother, child, I know not. My affairs
5084	Are servanted to others: though I owe
5085	My revenge properly, my remission lies
5086	In Volscian breasts. That we have been familiar,
5087	Ingrate forgetfulness shall poison, rather
5088	Than pity note how much. Therefore, be gone.
5089	Mine ears against your suits are stronger than
5090	Your gates against my force. Yet, for I loved thee,
5091	Take this along; I writ it for thy sake
5092	
5093	[Gives a letter]
5094	
5095	And would have rent it. Another word, Menenius,
5096	I will not hear thee speak. This man, Aufidius,
5097	Was my beloved in Rome: yet thou behold'st!
5098	
5099	AUFIDIUS	You keep a constant temper.
5100	
5101	[Exeunt CORIOLANUS and AUFIDIUS]
5102	
5103	First Senator	Now, sir, is your name Menenius?
5104	
5105	Second Senator	'Tis a spell, you see, of much power: you know the
5106	way home again.
5107	
5108	First Senator	Do you hear how we are shent for keeping your
5109	greatness back?
5110	
5111	Second Senator	What cause, do you think, I have to swoon?
5112	
5113	MENENIUS	I neither care for the world nor your general: for
5114	such things as you, I can scarce think there's any,
5115	ye're so slight. He that hath a will to die by
5116	himself fears it not from another: let your general
5117	do his worst. For you, be that you are, long; and
5118	your misery increase with your age! I say to you,
5119	as I was said to, Away!
5120	
5121	[Exit]
5122	
5123	First Senator	A noble fellow, I warrant him.
5124	
5125	Second Senator	The worthy fellow is our general: he's the rock, the
5126	oak not to be wind-shaken.
5127

5136	ACT V
5137	
5138	
5139	
5140	SCENE III	The tent of Coriolanus.
5141	
5142	
5143	[Enter CORIOLANUS, AUFIDIUS, and others]
5144	
5145	CORIOLANUS	We will before the walls of Rome tomorrow
5146	Set down our host. My partner in this action,
5147	You must report to the Volscian lords, how plainly
5148	I have borne this business.
5149	
5150	AUFIDIUS	Only their ends
5151	You have respected; stopp'd your ears against
5152	The general suit of Rome; never admitted
5153	A private whisper, no, not with such friends
5154	That thought them sure of you.
5155	
5156	CORIOLANUS	This last old man,
5157	Whom with a crack'd heart I have sent to Rome,
5158	Loved me above the measure of a father;
5159	Nay, godded me, indeed. Their latest refuge
5160	Was to send him; for whose old love I have,
5161	Though I show'd sourly to him, once more offer'd
5162	The first conditions, which they did refuse
5163	And cannot now accept; to grace him only
5164	That thought he could do more, a very little
5165	I have yielded to: fresh embassies and suits,
5166	Nor from the state nor private friends, hereafter
5167	Will I lend ear to. Ha! what shout is this?
5168	
5169	[Shout within]
5170	
5171	Shall I be tempted to infringe my vow
5172	In the same time 'tis made? I will not.
5173	
5174	[Enter in mourning habits, VIRGILIA, VOLUMNIA,
5175	leading young MARCIUS, VALERIA, and Attendants]
5176	
5177	My wife comes foremost; then the honour'd mould
5178	Wherein this trunk was framed, and in her hand
5179	The grandchild to her blood. But, out, affection!
5180	All bond and privilege of nature, break!
5181	Let it be virtuous to be obstinate.
5182	What is that curt'sy worth? or those doves' eyes,
5183	Which can make gods forsworn? I melt, and am not
5184	Of stronger earth than others. My mother bows;
5185	As if Olympus to a molehill should
5186	In supplication nod: and my young boy
5187	Hath an aspect of intercession, which
5188	Great nature cries 'Deny not.' let the Volsces
5189	Plough Rome and harrow Italy: I'll never
5190	Be such a gosling to obey instinct, but stand,
5191	As if a man were author of himself
5192	And knew no other kin.
5193	
5194	VIRGILIA	My lord and husband!
5195	
5196	CORIOLANUS	These eyes are not the same I wore in Rome.
5197	
5198	VIRGILIA	The sorrow that delivers us thus changed
5199	Makes you think so.
5200	
5201	CORIOLANUS	Like a dull actor now,
5202	I have forgot my part, and I am out,
5203	Even to a full disgrace. Best of my flesh,
5204	Forgive my tyranny; but do not say
5205	For that 'Forgive our Romans.' O, a kiss
5206	Long as my exile, sweet as my revenge!
5207	Now, by the jealous queen of heaven, that kiss
5208	I carried from thee, dear; and my true lip
5209	Hath virgin'd it e'er since. You gods! I prate,
5210	And the most noble mother of the world
5211	Leave unsaluted: sink, my knee, i' the earth;
5212	
5213	[Kneels]
5214	
5215	Of thy deep duty more impression show
5216	Than that of common sons.
5217	
5218	VOLUMNIA	O, stand up blest!
5219	Whilst, with no softer cushion than the flint,
5220	I kneel before thee; and unproperly
5221	Show duty, as mistaken all this while
5222	Between the child and parent.
5223	
5224	[Kneels]
5225	
5226	CORIOLANUS	What is this?
5227	Your knees to me? to your corrected son?
5228	Then let the pebbles on the hungry beach
5229	Fillip the stars; then let the mutinous winds
5230	Strike the proud cedars 'gainst the fiery sun;
5231	Murdering impossibility, to make
5232	What cannot be, slight work.
5233	
5234	VOLUMNIA	Thou art my warrior;
5235	I holp to frame thee. Do you know this lady?
5236	
5237	CORIOLANUS	The noble sister of Publicola,
5238	The moon of Rome, chaste as the icicle
5239	That's curdied by the frost from purest snow
5240	And hangs on Dian's temple: dear Valeria!
5241	
5242	VOLUMNIA	This is a poor epitome of yours,
5243	Which by the interpretation of full time
5244	May show like all yourself.
5245	
5246	CORIOLANUS	The god of soldiers,
5247	With the consent of supreme Jove, inform
5248	Thy thoughts with nobleness; that thou mayst prove
5249	To shame unvulnerable, and stick i' the wars
5250	Like a great sea-mark, standing every flaw,
5251	And saving those that eye thee!
5252	
5253	VOLUMNIA	Your knee, sirrah.
5254	
5255	CORIOLANUS	That's my brave boy!
5256	
5257	VOLUMNIA	Even he, your wife, this lady, and myself,
5258	Are suitors to you.
5259	
5260	CORIOLANUS	I beseech you, peace:
5261	Or, if you'ld ask, remember this before:
5262	The thing I have forsworn to grant may never
5263	Be held by you denials. Do not bid me
5264	Dismiss my soldiers, or capitulate
5265	Again with Rome's mechanics: tell me not
5266	Wherein I seem unnatural: desire not
5267	To ally my rages and revenges with
5268	Your colder reasons.
5269	
5270	VOLUMNIA	O, no more, no more!
5271	You have said you will not grant us any thing;
5272	For we have nothing else to ask, but that
5273	Which you deny already: yet we will ask;
5274	That, if you fail in our request, the blame
5275	May hang upon your hardness: therefore hear us.
5276	
5277	CORIOLANUS	Aufidius, and you Volsces, mark; for we'll
5278	Hear nought from Rome in private. Your request?
5279	
5280	VOLUMNIA	Should we be silent and not speak, our raiment
5281	And state of bodies would bewray what life
5282	We have led since thy exile. Think with thyself
5283	How more unfortunate than all living women
5284	Are we come hither: since that thy sight,
5285	which should
5286	Make our eyes flow with joy, hearts dance
5287	with comforts,
5288	Constrains them weep and shake with fear and sorrow;
5289	Making the mother, wife and child to see
5290	The son, the husband and the father tearing
5291	His country's bowels out. And to poor we
5292	Thine enmity's most capital: thou barr'st us
5293	Our prayers to the gods, which is a comfort
5294	That all but we enjoy; for how can we,
5295	Alas, how can we for our country pray.
5296	Whereto we are bound, together with thy victory,
5297	Whereto we are bound? alack, or we must lose
5298	The country, our dear nurse, or else thy person,
5299	Our comfort in the country. We must find
5300	An evident calamity, though we had
5301	Our wish, which side should win: for either thou
5302	Must, as a foreign recreant, be led
5303	With manacles thorough our streets, or else
5304	triumphantly tread on thy country's ruin,
5305	And bear the palm for having bravely shed
5306	Thy wife and children's blood. For myself, son,
5307	I purpose not to wait on fortune till
5308	These wars determine: if I cannot persuade thee
5309	Rather to show a noble grace to both parts
5310	Than seek the end of one, thou shalt no sooner
5311	March to assault thy country than to tread--
5312	Trust to't, thou shalt not--on thy mother's womb,
5313	That brought thee to this world.
5314	
5315	VIRGILIA	Ay, and mine,
5316	That brought you forth this boy, to keep your name
5317	Living to time.
5318	
5319	Young MARCIUS	A' shall not tread on me;
5320	I'll run away till I am bigger, but then I'll fight.
5321	
5322	CORIOLANUS	Not of a woman's tenderness to be,
5323	Requires nor child nor woman's face to see.
5324	I have sat too long.
5325	
5326	[Rising]
5327	
5328	VOLUMNIA	Nay, go not from us thus.
5329	If it were so that our request did tend
5330	To save the Romans, thereby to destroy
5331	The Volsces whom you serve, you might condemn us,
5332	As poisonous of your honour: no; our suit
5333	Is that you reconcile them: while the Volsces
5334	May say 'This mercy we have show'd;' the Romans,
5335	'This we received;' and each in either side
5336	Give the all-hail to thee and cry 'Be blest
5337	For making up this peace!' Thou know'st, great son,
5338	The end of war's uncertain, but this certain,
5339	That, if thou conquer Rome, the benefit
5340	Which thou shalt thereby reap is such a name,
5341	Whose repetition will be dogg'd with curses;
5342	Whose chronicle thus writ: 'The man was noble,
5343	But with his last attempt he wiped it out;
5344	Destroy'd his country, and his name remains
5345	To the ensuing age abhorr'd.' Speak to me, son:
5346	Thou hast affected the fine strains of honour,
5347	To imitate the graces of the gods;
5348	To tear with thunder the wide cheeks o' the air,
5349	And yet to charge thy sulphur with a bolt
5350	That should but rive an oak. Why dost not speak?
5351	Think'st thou it honourable for a noble man
5352	Still to remember wrongs? Daughter, speak you:
5353	He cares not for your weeping. Speak thou, boy:
5354	Perhaps thy childishness will move him more
5355	Than can our reasons. There's no man in the world
5356	More bound to 's mother; yet here he lets me prate
5357	Like one i' the stocks. Thou hast never in thy life
5358	Show'd thy dear mother any courtesy,
5359	When she, poor hen, fond of no second brood,
5360	Has cluck'd thee to the wars and safely home,
5361	Loaden with honour. Say my request's unjust,
5362	And spurn me back: but if it be not so,
5363	Thou art not honest; and the gods will plague thee,
5364	That thou restrain'st from me the duty which
5365	To a mother's part belongs. He turns away:
5366	Down, ladies; let us shame him with our knees.
5367	To his surname Coriolanus 'longs more pride
5368	Than pity to our prayers. Down: an end;
5369	This is the last: so we will home to Rome,
5370	And die among our neighbours. Nay, behold 's:
5371	This boy, that cannot tell what he would have
5372	But kneels and holds up bands for fellowship,
5373	Does reason our petition with more strength
5374	Than thou hast to deny 't. Come, let us go:
5375	This fellow had a Volscian to his mother;
5376	His wife is in Corioli and his child
5377	Like him by chance. Yet give us our dispatch:
5378	I am hush'd until our city be a-fire,
5379	And then I'll speak a little.
5380	
5381	[He holds her by the hand, silent]
5382	
5383	CORIOLANUS	O mother, mother!
5384	What have you done? Behold, the heavens do ope,
5385	The gods look down, and this unnatural scene
5386	They laugh at. O my mother, mother! O!
5387	You have won a happy victory to Rome;
5388	But, for your son,--believe it, O, believe it,
5389	Most dangerously you have with him prevail'd,
5390	If not most mortal to him. But, let it come.
5391	Aufidius, though I cannot make true wars,
5392	I'll frame convenient peace. Now, good Aufidius,
5393	Were you in my stead, would you have heard
5394	A mother less? or granted less, Aufidius?
5395	
5396	AUFIDIUS	I was moved withal.
5397	
5398	CORIOLANUS	I dare be sworn you were:
5399	And, sir, it is no little thing to make
5400	Mine eyes to sweat compassion. But, good sir,
5401	What peace you'll make, advise me: for my part,
5402	I'll not to Rome, I'll back with you; and pray you,
5403	Stand to me in this cause. O mother! wife!
5404	
5405	AUFIDIUS	[Aside]  I am glad thou hast set thy mercy and
5406	thy honour
5407	At difference in thee: out of that I'll work
5408	Myself a former fortune.
5409	
5410	[The Ladies make signs to CORIOLANUS]
5411	
5412	CORIOLANUS	Ay, by and by;
5413	
5414	[To VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA, &c]
5415	
5416	But we will drink together; and you shall bear
5417	A better witness back than words, which we,
5418	On like conditions, will have counter-seal'd.
5419	Come, enter with us. Ladies, you deserve
5420	To have a temple built you: all the swords
5421	In Italy, and her confederate arms,
5422	Could not have made this peace.
5423	
5424	[Exeunt]

5430	
5431	
5432	ACT V
5433	
5434	
5435	
5436	SCENE IV	Rome. A public place.
5437	
5438	
5439	[Enter MENENIUS and SICINIUS]
5440	
5441	MENENIUS	See you yond coign o' the Capitol, yond
5442	corner-stone?
5443	
5444	SICINIUS	Why, what of that?
5445	
5446	MENENIUS	If it be possible for you to displace it with your
5447	little finger, there is some hope the ladies of
5448	Rome, especially his mother, may prevail with him.
5449	But I say there is no hope in't: our throats are
5450	sentenced and stay upon execution.
5451	
5452	SICINIUS	Is't possible that so short a time can alter the
5453	condition of a man!
5454	
5455	MENENIUS	There is differency between a grub and a butterfly;
5456	yet your butterfly was a grub. This Marcius is grown
5457	from man to dragon: he has wings; he's more than a
5458	creeping thing.
5459	
5460	SICINIUS	He loved his mother dearly.
5461	
5462	MENENIUS	So did he me: and he no more remembers his mother
5463	now than an eight-year-old horse. The tartness
5464	of his face sours ripe grapes: when he walks, he
5465	moves like an engine, and the ground shrinks before
5466	his treading: he is able to pierce a corslet with
5467	his eye; talks like a knell, and his hum is a
5468	battery. He sits in his state, as a thing made for
5469	Alexander. What he bids be done is finished with
5470	his bidding. He wants nothing of a god but eternity
5471	and a heaven to throne in.
5472	
5473	SICINIUS	Yes, mercy, if you report him truly.
5474	
5475	MENENIUS	I paint him in the character. Mark what mercy his
5476	mother shall bring from him: there is no more mercy
5477	in him than there is milk in a male tiger; that
5478	shall our poor city find: and all this is long of
5479	you.
5480	
5481	SICINIUS	The gods be good unto us!
5482	
5483	MENENIUS	No, in such a case the gods will not be good unto
5484	us. When we banished him, we respected not them;
5485	and, he returning to break our necks, they respect not us.
5486	
5487	[Enter a Messenger]
5488	
5489	Messenger	Sir, if you'ld save your life, fly to your house:
5490	The plebeians have got your fellow-tribune
5491	And hale him up and down, all swearing, if
5492	The Roman ladies bring not comfort home,
5493	They'll give him death by inches.
5494	
5495	[Enter a second Messenger]
5496	
5497	SICINIUS	What's the news?
5498	
5499	Second Messenger	Good news, good news; the ladies have prevail'd,
5500	The Volscians are dislodged, and Marcius gone:
5501	A merrier day did never yet greet Rome,
5502	No, not the expulsion of the Tarquins.
5503	
5504	SICINIUS	Friend,
5505	Art thou certain this is true? is it most certain?
5506	
5507	Second Messenger	As certain as I know the sun is fire:
5508	Where have you lurk'd, that you make doubt of it?
5509	Ne'er through an arch so hurried the blown tide,
5510	As the recomforted through the gates. Why, hark you!
5511	
5512	[Trumpets; hautboys; drums beat; all together]
5513	
5514	The trumpets, sackbuts, psalteries and fifes,
5515	Tabours and cymbals and the shouting Romans,
5516	Make the sun dance. Hark you!
5517	
5518	[A shout within]
5519	
5520	MENENIUS	This is good news:
5521	I will go meet the ladies. This Volumnia
5522	Is worth of consuls, senators, patricians,
5523	A city full; of tribunes, such as you,
5524	A sea and land full. You have pray'd well to-day:
5525	This morning for ten thousand of your throats
5526	I'd not have given a doit. Hark, how they joy!
5527	
5528	[Music still, with shouts]
5529	
5530	SICINIUS	First, the gods bless you for your tidings; next,
5531	Accept my thankfulness.
5532	
5533	Second Messenger	Sir, we have all
5534	Great cause to give great thanks.
5535	
5536	SICINIUS	They are near the city?
5537	
5538	Second Messenger	Almost at point to enter.
5539	
5540	SICINIUS	We will meet them,
5541	And help the joy.

5555	SCENE V	The same. A street near the gate.
5556	
5557	
5558	[Enter two Senators with VOLUMNIA, VIRGILIA,
5559	VALERIA, &c. passing over the stage,
5560	followed by Patricians and others]
5561	
5562	First Senator	Behold our patroness, the life of Rome!
5563	Call all your tribes together, praise the gods,
5564	And make triumphant fires; strew flowers before them:
5565	Unshout the noise that banish'd Marcius,
5566	Repeal him with the welcome of his mother;
5567	Cry 'Welcome, ladies, welcome!'
5568	
5569	All	Welcome, ladies, Welcome!

5582	
5583	SCENE VI	Antium. A public place.
5584	
5585	
5586	[Enter TULLUS AUFIDIUS, with Attendants]
5587	
5588	AUFIDIUS	Go tell the lords o' the city I am here:
5589	Deliver them this paper: having read it,
5590	Bid them repair to the market place; where I,
5591	Even in theirs and in the commons' ears,
5592	Will vouch the truth of it. Him I accuse
5593	The city ports by this hath enter'd and
5594	Intends to appear before the people, hoping
5595	To purge herself with words: dispatch.
5596	
5597	[Exeunt Attendants]
5598	
5599	[Enter three or four Conspirators of AUFIDIUS' faction]
5600	
5601	Most welcome!
5602	
5603	First Conspirator	How is it with our general?
5604	
5605	AUFIDIUS	Even so
5606	As with a man by his own alms empoison'd,
5607	And with his charity slain.
5608	
5609	Second Conspirator	Most noble sir,
5610	If you do hold the same intent wherein
5611	You wish'd us parties, we'll deliver you
5612	Of your great danger.
5613	
5614	AUFIDIUS	Sir, I cannot tell:
5615	We must proceed as we do find the people.
5616	
5617	Third Conspirator	The people will remain uncertain whilst
5618	'Twixt you there's difference; but the fall of either
5619	Makes the survivor heir of all.
5620	
5621	AUFIDIUS	I know it;
5622	And my pretext to strike at him admits
5623	A good construction. I raised him, and I pawn'd
5624	Mine honour for his truth: who being so heighten'd,
5625	He water'd his new plants with dews of flattery,
5626	Seducing so my friends; and, to this end,
5627	He bow'd his nature, never known before
5628	But to be rough, unswayable and free.
5629	
5630	Third Conspirator	Sir, his stoutness
5631	When he did stand for consul, which he lost
5632	By lack of stooping,--
5633	
5634	AUFIDIUS	That I would have spoke of:
5635	Being banish'd for't, he came unto my hearth;
5636	Presented to my knife his throat: I took him;
5637	Made him joint-servant with me; gave him way
5638	In all his own desires; nay, let him choose
5639	Out of my files, his projects to accomplish,
5640	My best and freshest men; served his designments
5641	In mine own person; holp to reap the fame
5642	Which he did end all his; and took some pride
5643	To do myself this wrong: till, at the last,
5644	I seem'd his follower, not partner, and
5645	He waged me with his countenance, as if
5646	I had been mercenary.
5647	
5648	First Conspirator	So he did, my lord:
5649	The army marvell'd at it, and, in the last,
5650	When he had carried Rome and that we look'd
5651	For no less spoil than glory,--
5652	
5653	AUFIDIUS	There was it:
5654	For which my sinews shall be stretch'd upon him.
5655	At a few drops of women's rheum, which are
5656	As cheap as lies, he sold the blood and labour
5657	Of our great action: therefore shall he die,
5658	And I'll renew me in his fall. But, hark!
5659	
5660	[Drums and trumpets sound, with great shouts of
5661	the People]
5662	
5663	First Conspirator	Your native town you enter'd like a post,
5664	And had no welcomes home: but he returns,
5665	Splitting the air with noise.
5666	
5667	Second Conspirator	And patient fools,
5668	Whose children he hath slain, their base throats tear
5669	With giving him glory.
5670	
5671	Third Conspirator	Therefore, at your vantage,
5672	Ere he express himself, or move the people
5673	With what he would say, let him feel your sword,
5674	Which we will second. When he lies along,
5675	After your way his tale pronounced shall bury
5676	His reasons with his body.
5677	
5678	AUFIDIUS	Say no more:
5679	Here come the lords.
5680	
5681	[Enter the Lords of the city]
5682	
5683	All The Lords	You are most welcome home.
5684	
5685	AUFIDIUS	I have not deserved it.
5686	But, worthy lords, have you with heed perused
5687	What I have written to you?
5688	
5689	Lords	We have.
5690	
5691	First Lord	And grieve to hear't.
5692	What faults he made before the last, I think
5693	Might have found easy fines: but there to end
5694	Where he was to begin and give away
5695	The benefit of our levies, answering us
5696	With our own charge, making a treaty where
5697	There was a yielding,--this admits no excuse.
5698	
5699	AUFIDIUS	He approaches: you shall hear him.
5700	
5701	[Enter CORIOLANUS, marching with drum and
5702	colours; commoners being with him]
5703	
5704	CORIOLANUS	Hail, lords! I am return'd your soldier,
5705	No more infected with my country's love
5706	Than when I parted hence, but still subsisting
5707	Under your great command. You are to know
5708	That prosperously I have attempted and
5709	With bloody passage led your wars even to
5710	The gates of Rome. Our spoils we have brought home
5711	Do more than counterpoise a full third part
5712	The charges of the action. We have made peace
5713	With no less honour to the Antiates
5714	Than shame to the Romans: and we here deliver,
5715	Subscribed by the consuls and patricians,
5716	Together with the seal o' the senate, what
5717	We have compounded on.
5718	
5719	AUFIDIUS	Read it not, noble lords;
5720	But tell the traitor, in the high'st degree
5721	He hath abused your powers.
5722	
5723	CORIOLANUS	Traitor! how now!
5724	
5725	AUFIDIUS	                  Ay, traitor, Marcius!
5726	
5727	CORIOLANUS	Marcius!
5728	
5729	AUFIDIUS	Ay, Marcius, Caius Marcius: dost thou think
5730	I'll grace thee with that robbery, thy stol'n name
5731	Coriolanus in Corioli?
5732	You lords and heads o' the state, perfidiously
5733	He has betray'd your business, and given up,
5734	For certain drops of salt, your city Rome,
5735	I say 'your city,' to his wife and mother;
5736	Breaking his oath and resolution like
5737	A twist of rotten silk, never admitting
5738	Counsel o' the war, but at his nurse's tears
5739	He whined and roar'd away your victory,
5740	That pages blush'd at him and men of heart
5741	Look'd wondering each at other.
5742	
5743	CORIOLANUS	Hear'st thou, Mars?
5744	
5745	AUFIDIUS	Name not the god, thou boy of tears!
5746	
5747	CORIOLANUS	Ha!
5748	
5749	AUFIDIUS	No more.
5750	
5751	CORIOLANUS	Measureless liar, thou hast made my heart
5752	Too great for what contains it. Boy! O slave!
5753	Pardon me, lords, 'tis the first time that ever
5754	I was forced to scold. Your judgments, my grave lords,
5755	Must give this cur the lie: and his own notion--
5756	Who wears my stripes impress'd upon him; that
5757	Must bear my beating to his grave--shall join
5758	To thrust the lie unto him.
5759	
5760	First Lord	Peace, both, and hear me speak.
5761	
5762	CORIOLANUS	Cut me to pieces, Volsces; men and lads,
5763	Stain all your edges on me. Boy! false hound!
5764	If you have writ your annals true, 'tis there,
5765	That, like an eagle in a dove-cote, I
5766	Flutter'd your Volscians in Corioli:
5767	Alone I did it. Boy!
5768	
5769	AUFIDIUS	Why, noble lords,
5770	Will you be put in mind of his blind fortune,
5771	Which was your shame, by this unholy braggart,
5772	'Fore your own eyes and ears?
5773	
5774	All Conspirators	Let him die for't.
5775	
5776	All The People	'Tear him to pieces.' 'Do it presently.' 'He kill'd
5777	my son.' 'My daughter.' 'He killed my cousin
5778	Marcus.' 'He killed my father.'
5779	
5780	Second Lord	Peace, ho! no outrage: peace!
5781	The man is noble and his fame folds-in
5782	This orb o' the earth. His last offences to us
5783	Shall have judicious hearing. Stand, Aufidius,
5784	And trouble not the peace.
5785	
5786	CORIOLANUS	O that I had him,
5787	With six Aufidiuses, or more, his tribe,
5788	To use my lawful sword!
5789	
5790	AUFIDIUS	Insolent villain!
5791	
5792	All Conspirators	Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill him!
5793	
5794	[The Conspirators draw, and kill CORIOLANUS:
5795	AUFIDIUS stands on his body]
5796	
5797	Lords	Hold, hold, hold, hold!
5798	
5799	AUFIDIUS	My noble masters, hear me speak.
5800	
5801	First Lord	O Tullus,--
5802	
5803	Second Lord	Thou hast done a deed whereat valour will weep.
5804	
5805	Third Lord	Tread not upon him. Masters all, be quiet;
5806	Put up your swords.
5807	
5808	AUFIDIUS	My lords, when you shall know--as in this rage,
5809	Provoked by him, you cannot--the great danger
5810	Which this man's life did owe you, you'll rejoice
5811	That he is thus cut off. Please it your honours
5812	To call me to your senate, I'll deliver
5813	Myself your loyal servant, or endure
5814	Your heaviest censure.
5815	
5816	First Lord	Bear from hence his body;
5817	And mourn you for him: let him be regarded
5818	As the most noble corse that ever herald
5819	Did follow to his urn.
5820	
5821	Second Lord	His own impatience
5822	Takes from Aufidius a great part of blame.
5823	Let's make the best of it.
5824	
5825	AUFIDIUS	My rage is gone;
5826	And I am struck with sorrow. Take him up.
5827	Help, three o' the chiefest soldiers; I'll be one.
5828	Beat thou the drum, that it speak mournfully:
5829	Trail your steel pikes. Though in this city he
5830	Hath widow'd and unchilded many a one,
5831	Which to this hour bewail the injury,
5832	Yet he shall have a noble memory. Assist.
5833	
5834	[Exeunt, bearing the body of CORIOLANUS. A dead
5835	march sounded]

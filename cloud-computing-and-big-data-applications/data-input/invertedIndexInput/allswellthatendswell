58	ACT I
59	
60	
61	
62	SCENE I	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
63	
64	
65	[Enter BERTRAM, the COUNTESS of Rousillon, HELENA,
66	and LAFEU, all in black]
67	
68	COUNTESS	In delivering my son from me, I bury a second husband.
69	
70	BERTRAM	And I in going, madam, weep o'er my father's death
71	anew: but I must attend his majesty's command, to
72	whom I am now in ward, evermore in subjection.
73	
74	LAFEU	You shall find of the king a husband, madam; you,
75	sir, a father: he that so generally is at all times
76	good must of necessity hold his virtue to you; whose
77	worthiness would stir it up where it wanted rather
78	than lack it where there is such abundance.
79	
80	COUNTESS	What hope is there of his majesty's amendment?
81	
82	LAFEU	He hath abandoned his physicians, madam; under whose
83	practises he hath persecuted time with hope, and
84	finds no other advantage in the process but only the
85	losing of hope by time.
86	
87	COUNTESS	This young gentlewoman had a father,--O, that
88	'had'! how sad a passage 'tis!--whose skill was
89	almost as great as his honesty; had it stretched so
90	far, would have made nature immortal, and death
91	should have play for lack of work. Would, for the
92	king's sake, he were living! I think it would be
93	the death of the king's disease.
94	
95	LAFEU	How called you the man you speak of, madam?
96	
97	COUNTESS	He was famous, sir, in his profession, and it was
98	his great right to be so: Gerard de Narbon.
99	
100	LAFEU	He was excellent indeed, madam: the king very
101	lately spoke of him admiringly and mourningly: he
102	was skilful enough to have lived still, if knowledge
103	could be set up against mortality.
104	
105	BERTRAM	What is it, my good lord, the king languishes of?
106	
107	LAFEU	A fistula, my lord.
108	
109	BERTRAM	I heard not of it before.
110	
111	LAFEU	I would it were not notorious. Was this gentlewoman
112	the daughter of Gerard de Narbon?
113	
114	COUNTESS	His sole child, my lord, and bequeathed to my
115	overlooking. I have those hopes of her good that
116	her education promises; her dispositions she
117	inherits, which makes fair gifts fairer; for where
118	an unclean mind carries virtuous qualities, there
119	commendations go with pity; they are virtues and
120	traitors too; in her they are the better for their
121	simpleness; she derives her honesty and achieves her goodness.
122	
123	LAFEU	Your commendations, madam, get from her tears.
124	
125	COUNTESS	'Tis the best brine a maiden can season her praise
126	in. The remembrance of her father never approaches
127	her heart but the tyranny of her sorrows takes all
128	livelihood from her cheek. No more of this, Helena;
129	go to, no more; lest it be rather thought you affect
130	a sorrow than have it.
131	
132	HELENA	I do affect a sorrow indeed, but I have it too.
133	
134	LAFEU	Moderate lamentation is the right of the dead,
135	excessive grief the enemy to the living.
136	
137	COUNTESS	If the living be enemy to the grief, the excess
138	makes it soon mortal.
139	
140	BERTRAM	Madam, I desire your holy wishes.
141	
142	LAFEU	How understand we that?
143	
144	COUNTESS	Be thou blest, Bertram, and succeed thy father
145	In manners, as in shape! thy blood and virtue
146	Contend for empire in thee, and thy goodness
147	Share with thy birthright! Love all, trust a few,
148	Do wrong to none: be able for thine enemy
149	Rather in power than use, and keep thy friend
150	Under thy own life's key: be cheque'd for silence,
151	But never tax'd for speech. What heaven more will,
152	That thee may furnish and my prayers pluck down,
153	Fall on thy head! Farewell, my lord;
154	'Tis an unseason'd courtier; good my lord,
155	Advise him.
156	
157	LAFEU	          He cannot want the best
158	That shall attend his love.
159	
160	COUNTESS	Heaven bless him! Farewell, Bertram.
161	
162	[Exit]
163	
164	BERTRAM	[To HELENA]  The best wishes that can be forged in
165	your thoughts be servants to you! Be comfortable
166	to my mother, your mistress, and make much of her.
167	
168	LAFEU	Farewell, pretty lady: you must hold the credit of
169	your father.
170	
171	[Exeunt BERTRAM and LAFEU]
172	
173	HELENA	O, were that all! I think not on my father;
174	And these great tears grace his remembrance more
175	Than those I shed for him. What was he like?
176	I have forgot him: my imagination
177	Carries no favour in't but Bertram's.
178	I am undone: there is no living, none,
179	If Bertram be away. 'Twere all one
180	That I should love a bright particular star
181	And think to wed it, he is so above me:
182	In his bright radiance and collateral light
183	Must I be comforted, not in his sphere.
184	The ambition in my love thus plagues itself:
185	The hind that would be mated by the lion
186	Must die for love. 'Twas pretty, though plague,
187	To see him every hour; to sit and draw
188	His arched brows, his hawking eye, his curls,
189	In our heart's table; heart too capable
190	Of every line and trick of his sweet favour:
191	But now he's gone, and my idolatrous fancy
192	Must sanctify his reliques. Who comes here?
193	
194	[Enter PAROLLES]
195	
196	[Aside]
197	
198	One that goes with him: I love him for his sake;
199	And yet I know him a notorious liar,
200	Think him a great way fool, solely a coward;
201	Yet these fixed evils sit so fit in him,
202	That they take place, when virtue's steely bones
203	Look bleak i' the cold wind: withal, full oft we see
204	Cold wisdom waiting on superfluous folly.
205	
206	PAROLLES	Save you, fair queen!
207	
208	HELENA	And you, monarch!
209	
210	PAROLLES	No.
211	
212	HELENA	And no.
213	
214	PAROLLES	Are you meditating on virginity?
215	
216	HELENA	Ay. You have some stain of soldier in you: let me
217	ask you a question. Man is enemy to virginity; how
218	may we barricado it against him?
219	
220	PAROLLES	Keep him out.
221	
222	HELENA	But he assails; and our virginity, though valiant,
223	in the defence yet is weak: unfold to us some
224	warlike resistance.
225	
226	PAROLLES	There is none: man, sitting down before you, will
227	undermine you and blow you up.
228	
229	HELENA	Bless our poor virginity from underminers and
230	blowers up! Is there no military policy, how
231	virgins might blow up men?
232	
233	PAROLLES	Virginity being blown down, man will quicklier be
234	blown up: marry, in blowing him down again, with
235	the breach yourselves made, you lose your city. It
236	is not politic in the commonwealth of nature to
237	preserve virginity. Loss of virginity is rational
238	increase and there was never virgin got till
239	virginity was first lost. That you were made of is
240	metal to make virgins. Virginity by being once lost
241	may be ten times found; by being ever kept, it is
242	ever lost: 'tis too cold a companion; away with 't!
243	
244	HELENA	I will stand for 't a little, though therefore I die a virgin.
245	
246	PAROLLES	There's little can be said in 't; 'tis against the
247	rule of nature. To speak on the part of virginity,
248	is to accuse your mothers; which is most infallible
249	disobedience. He that hangs himself is a virgin:
250	virginity murders itself and should be buried in
251	highways out of all sanctified limit, as a desperate
252	offendress against nature. Virginity breeds mites,
253	much like a cheese; consumes itself to the very
254	paring, and so dies with feeding his own stomach.
255	Besides, virginity is peevish, proud, idle, made of
256	self-love, which is the most inhibited sin in the
257	canon. Keep it not; you cannot choose but loose
258	by't: out with 't! within ten year it will make
259	itself ten, which is a goodly increase; and the
260	principal itself not much the worse: away with 't!
261	
262	HELENA	How might one do, sir, to lose it to her own liking?
263	
264	PAROLLES	Let me see: marry, ill, to like him that ne'er it
265	likes. 'Tis a commodity will lose the gloss with
266	lying; the longer kept, the less worth: off with 't
267	while 'tis vendible; answer the time of request.
268	Virginity, like an old courtier, wears her cap out
269	of fashion: richly suited, but unsuitable: just
270	like the brooch and the tooth-pick, which wear not
271	now. Your date is better in your pie and your
272	porridge than in your cheek; and your virginity,
273	your old virginity, is like one of our French
274	withered pears, it looks ill, it eats drily; marry,
275	'tis a withered pear; it was formerly better;
276	marry, yet 'tis a withered pear: will you anything with it?
277	
278	HELENA	Not my virginity yet [         ]
279	There shall your master have a thousand loves,
280	A mother and a mistress and a friend,
281	A phoenix, captain and an enemy,
282	A guide, a goddess, and a sovereign,
283	A counsellor, a traitress, and a dear;
284	His humble ambition, proud humility,
285	His jarring concord, and his discord dulcet,
286	His faith, his sweet disaster; with a world
287	Of pretty, fond, adoptious christendoms,
288	That blinking Cupid gossips. Now shall he--
289	I know not what he shall. God send him well!
290	The court's a learning place, and he is one--
291	
292	PAROLLES	What one, i' faith?
293	
294	HELENA	That I wish well. 'Tis pity--
295	
296	PAROLLES	What's pity?
297	
298	HELENA	That wishing well had not a body in't,
299	Which might be felt; that we, the poorer born,
300	Whose baser stars do shut us up in wishes,
301	Might with effects of them follow our friends,
302	And show what we alone must think, which never
303	Return us thanks.

306	
307	Page	Monsieur Parolles, my lord calls for you.
308	
309	[Exit]
310	
311	PAROLLES	Little Helen, farewell; if I can remember thee, I
312	will think of thee at court.
313	
314	HELENA	Monsieur Parolles, you were born under a charitable star.
315	
316	PAROLLES	Under Mars, I.
317	
318	HELENA	I especially think, under Mars.
319	
320	PAROLLES	Why under Mars?
321	
322	HELENA	The wars have so kept you under that you must needs
323	be born under Mars.
324	
325	PAROLLES	When he was predominant.
326	
327	HELENA	When he was retrograde, I think, rather.
328	
329	PAROLLES	Why think you so?
330	
331	HELENA	You go so much backward when you fight.
332	
333	PAROLLES	That's for advantage.
334	
335	HELENA	So is running away, when fear proposes the safety;
336	but the composition that your valour and fear makes
337	in you is a virtue of a good wing, and I like the wear well.
338	
339	PAROLLES	I am so full of businesses, I cannot answer thee
340	acutely. I will return perfect courtier; in the
341	which, my instruction shall serve to naturalize
342	thee, so thou wilt be capable of a courtier's
343	counsel and understand what advice shall thrust upon
344	thee; else thou diest in thine unthankfulness, and
345	thine ignorance makes thee away: farewell. When
346	thou hast leisure, say thy prayers; when thou hast
347	none, remember thy friends; get thee a good husband,
348	and use him as he uses thee; so, farewell.
349	
350	[Exit]
351	
352	HELENA	Our remedies oft in ourselves do lie,
353	Which we ascribe to heaven: the fated sky
354	Gives us free scope, only doth backward pull
355	Our slow designs when we ourselves are dull.
356	What power is it which mounts my love so high,
357	That makes me see, and cannot feed mine eye?
358	The mightiest space in fortune nature brings
359	To join like likes and kiss like native things.
360	Impossible be strange attempts to those
361	That weigh their pains in sense and do suppose
362	What hath been cannot be: who ever strove
363	So show her merit, that did miss her love?
364	The king's disease--my project may deceive me,
365	But my intents are fix'd and will not leave me.
366	
367	[Exit]

379	SCENE II	Paris. The KING's palace.
380	
381	
382	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING of France,
383	with letters, and divers Attendants]
384	
385	KING	The Florentines and Senoys are by the ears;
386	Have fought with equal fortune and continue
387	A braving war.
388	
389	First Lord	                  So 'tis reported, sir.
390	
391	KING	Nay, 'tis most credible; we here received it
392	A certainty, vouch'd from our cousin Austria,
393	With caution that the Florentine will move us
394	For speedy aid; wherein our dearest friend
395	Prejudicates the business and would seem
396	To have us make denial.
397	
398	First Lord	His love and wisdom,
399	Approved so to your majesty, may plead
400	For amplest credence.
401	
402	KING	He hath arm'd our answer,
403	And Florence is denied before he comes:
404	Yet, for our gentlemen that mean to see
405	The Tuscan service, freely have they leave
406	To stand on either part.
407	
408	Second Lord	It well may serve
409	A nursery to our gentry, who are sick
410	For breathing and exploit.
411	
412	KING	What's he comes here?
413	
414	[Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]
415	
416	First Lord	It is the Count Rousillon, my good lord,
417	Young Bertram.
418	
419	KING	                  Youth, thou bear'st thy father's face;
420	Frank nature, rather curious than in haste,
421	Hath well composed thee. Thy father's moral parts
422	Mayst thou inherit too! Welcome to Paris.
423	
424	BERTRAM	My thanks and duty are your majesty's.
425	
426	KING	I would I had that corporal soundness now,
427	As when thy father and myself in friendship
428	First tried our soldiership! He did look far
429	Into the service of the time and was
430	Discipled of the bravest: he lasted long;
431	But on us both did haggish age steal on
432	And wore us out of act. It much repairs me
433	To talk of your good father. In his youth
434	He had the wit which I can well observe
435	To-day in our young lords; but they may jest
436	Till their own scorn return to them unnoted
437	Ere they can hide their levity in honour;
438	So like a courtier, contempt nor bitterness
439	Were in his pride or sharpness; if they were,
440	His equal had awaked them, and his honour,
441	Clock to itself, knew the true minute when
442	Exception bid him speak, and at this time
443	His tongue obey'd his hand: who were below him
444	He used as creatures of another place
445	And bow'd his eminent top to their low ranks,
446	Making them proud of his humility,
447	In their poor praise he humbled. Such a man
448	Might be a copy to these younger times;
449	Which, follow'd well, would demonstrate them now
450	But goers backward.
451	
452	BERTRAM	His good remembrance, sir,
453	Lies richer in your thoughts than on his tomb;
454	So in approof lives not his epitaph
455	As in your royal speech.
456	
457	KING	Would I were with him! He would always say--
458	Methinks I hear him now; his plausive words
459	He scatter'd not in ears, but grafted them,
460	To grow there and to bear,--'Let me not live,'--
461	This his good melancholy oft began,
462	On the catastrophe and heel of pastime,
463	When it was out,--'Let me not live,' quoth he,
464	'After my flame lacks oil, to be the snuff
465	Of younger spirits, whose apprehensive senses
466	All but new things disdain; whose judgments are
467	Mere fathers of their garments; whose constancies
468	Expire before their fashions.' This he wish'd;
469	I after him do after him wish too,
470	Since I nor wax nor honey can bring home,
471	I quickly were dissolved from my hive,
472	To give some labourers room.
473	
474	Second Lord	You are loved, sir:
475	They that least lend it you shall lack you first.
476	
477	KING	I fill a place, I know't. How long is't, count,
478	Since the physician at your father's died?
479	He was much famed.
480	
481	BERTRAM	                  Some six months since, my lord.
482	
483	KING	If he were living, I would try him yet.
484	Lend me an arm; the rest have worn me out
485	With several applications; nature and sickness
486	Debate it at their leisure. Welcome, count;
487	My son's no dearer.
488	
489	BERTRAM	Thank your majesty.

499	ACT I
500	
501	
502	
503	SCENE III	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
504	
505	
506	[Enter COUNTESS, Steward, and Clown]
507	
508	COUNTESS	I will now hear; what say you of this gentlewoman?
509	
510	Steward	Madam, the care I have had to even your content, I
511	wish might be found in the calendar of my past
512	endeavours; for then we wound our modesty and make
513	foul the clearness of our deservings, when of
514	ourselves we publish them.
515	
516	COUNTESS	What does this knave here? Get you gone, sirrah:
517	the complaints I have heard of you I do not all
518	believe: 'tis my slowness that I do not; for I know
519	you lack not folly to commit them, and have ability
520	enough to make such knaveries yours.
521	
522	Clown	'Tis not unknown to you, madam, I am a poor fellow.
523	
524	COUNTESS	Well, sir.
525	
526	Clown	No, madam, 'tis not so well that I am poor, though
527	many of the rich are damned: but, if I may have
528	your ladyship's good will to go to the world, Isbel
529	the woman and I will do as we may.
530	
531	COUNTESS	Wilt thou needs be a beggar?
532	
533	Clown	I do beg your good will in this case.
534	
535	COUNTESS	In what case?
536	
537	Clown	In Isbel's case and mine own. Service is no
538	heritage: and I think I shall never have the
539	blessing of God till I have issue o' my body; for
540	they say barnes are blessings.
541	
542	COUNTESS	Tell me thy reason why thou wilt marry.
543	
544	Clown	My poor body, madam, requires it: I am driven on
545	by the flesh; and he must needs go that the devil drives.
546	
547	COUNTESS	Is this all your worship's reason?
548	
549	Clown	Faith, madam, I have other holy reasons such as they
550	are.
551	
552	COUNTESS	May the world know them?
553	
554	Clown	I have been, madam, a wicked creature, as you and
555	all flesh and blood are; and, indeed, I do marry
556	that I may repent.
557	
558	COUNTESS	Thy marriage, sooner than thy wickedness.
559	
560	Clown	I am out o' friends, madam; and I hope to have
561	friends for my wife's sake.
562	
563	COUNTESS	Such friends are thine enemies, knave.
564	
565	Clown	You're shallow, madam, in great friends; for the
566	knaves come to do that for me which I am aweary of.
567	He that ears my land spares my team and gives me
568	leave to in the crop; if I be his cuckold, he's my
569	drudge: he that comforts my wife is the cherisher
570	of my flesh and blood; he that cherishes my flesh
571	and blood loves my flesh and blood; he that loves my
572	flesh and blood is my friend: ergo, he that kisses
573	my wife is my friend. If men could be contented to
574	be what they are, there were no fear in marriage;
575	for young Charbon the Puritan and old Poysam the
576	Papist, howsome'er their hearts are severed in
577	religion, their heads are both one; they may jowl
578	horns together, like any deer i' the herd.
579	
580	COUNTESS	Wilt thou ever be a foul-mouthed and calumnious knave?
581	
582	Clown	A prophet I, madam; and I speak the truth the next
583	way:
584	For I the ballad will repeat,
585	Which men full true shall find;
586	Your marriage comes by destiny,
587	Your cuckoo sings by kind.
588	
589	COUNTESS	Get you gone, sir; I'll talk with you more anon.
590	
591	Steward	May it please you, madam, that he bid Helen come to
592	you: of her I am to speak.
593	
594	COUNTESS	Sirrah, tell my gentlewoman I would speak with her;
595	Helen, I mean.
596	
597	Clown	     Was this fair face the cause, quoth she,
598	Why the Grecians sacked Troy?
599	Fond done, done fond,
600	Was this King Priam's joy?
601	With that she sighed as she stood,
602	With that she sighed as she stood,
603	And gave this sentence then;
604	Among nine bad if one be good,
605	Among nine bad if one be good,
606	There's yet one good in ten.
607	
608	COUNTESS	What, one good in ten? you corrupt the song, sirrah.
609	
610	Clown	One good woman in ten, madam; which is a purifying
611	o' the song: would God would serve the world so all
612	the year! we'ld find no fault with the tithe-woman,
613	if I were the parson. One in ten, quoth a'! An we
614	might have a good woman born but one every blazing
615	star, or at an earthquake, 'twould mend the lottery
616	well: a man may draw his heart out, ere a' pluck
617	one.
618	
619	COUNTESS	You'll be gone, sir knave, and do as I command you.
620	
621	Clown	That man should be at woman's command, and yet no
622	hurt done! Though honesty be no puritan, yet it
623	will do no hurt; it will wear the surplice of
624	humility over the black gown of a big heart. I am
625	going, forsooth: the business is for Helen to come hither.
626	
627	[Exit]
628	
629	COUNTESS	Well, now.
630	
631	Steward	I know, madam, you love your gentlewoman entirely.
632	
633	COUNTESS	Faith, I do: her father bequeathed her to me; and
634	she herself, without other advantage, may lawfully
635	make title to as much love as she finds: there is
636	more owing her than is paid; and more shall be paid
637	her than she'll demand.
638	
639	Steward	Madam, I was very late more near her than I think
640	she wished me: alone she was, and did communicate
641	to herself her own words to her own ears; she
642	thought, I dare vow for her, they touched not any
643	stranger sense. Her matter was, she loved your son:
644	Fortune, she said, was no goddess, that had put
645	such difference betwixt their two estates; Love no
646	god, that would not extend his might, only where
647	qualities were level; Dian no queen of virgins, that
648	would suffer her poor knight surprised, without
649	rescue in the first assault or ransom afterward.
650	This she delivered in the most bitter touch of
651	sorrow that e'er I heard virgin exclaim in: which I
652	held my duty speedily to acquaint you withal;
653	sithence, in the loss that may happen, it concerns
654	you something to know it.
655	
656	COUNTESS	You have discharged this honestly; keep it to
657	yourself: many likelihoods informed me of this
658	before, which hung so tottering in the balance that
659	I could neither believe nor misdoubt. Pray you,
660	leave me: stall this in your bosom; and I thank you
661	for your honest care: I will speak with you further anon.
662	
663	[Exit Steward]
664	
665	[Enter HELENA]
666	
667	Even so it was with me when I was young:
668	If ever we are nature's, these are ours; this thorn
669	Doth to our rose of youth rightly belong;
670	Our blood to us, this to our blood is born;
671	It is the show and seal of nature's truth,
672	Where love's strong passion is impress'd in youth:
673	By our remembrances of days foregone,
674	Such were our faults, or then we thought them none.
675	Her eye is sick on't: I observe her now.
676	
677	HELENA	What is your pleasure, madam?
678	
679	COUNTESS	You know, Helen,
680	I am a mother to you.
681	
682	HELENA	Mine honourable mistress.
683	
684	COUNTESS	Nay, a mother:
685	Why not a mother? When I said 'a mother,'
686	Methought you saw a serpent: what's in 'mother,'
687	That you start at it? I say, I am your mother;
688	And put you in the catalogue of those
689	That were enwombed mine: 'tis often seen
690	Adoption strives with nature and choice breeds
691	A native slip to us from foreign seeds:
692	You ne'er oppress'd me with a mother's groan,
693	Yet I express to you a mother's care:
694	God's mercy, maiden! does it curd thy blood
695	To say I am thy mother? What's the matter,
696	That this distemper'd messenger of wet,
697	The many-colour'd Iris, rounds thine eye?
698	Why? that you are my daughter?
699	
700	HELENA	That I am not.
701	
702	COUNTESS	I say, I am your mother.
703	
704	HELENA	Pardon, madam;
705	The Count Rousillon cannot be my brother:
706	I am from humble, he from honour'd name;
707	No note upon my parents, his all noble:
708	My master, my dear lord he is; and I
709	His servant live, and will his vassal die:
710	He must not be my brother.
711	
712	COUNTESS	Nor I your mother?
713	
714	HELENA	You are my mother, madam; would you were,--
715	So that my lord your son were not my brother,--
716	Indeed my mother! or were you both our mothers,
717	I care no more for than I do for heaven,
718	So I were not his sister. Can't no other,
719	But, I your daughter, he must be my brother?
720	
721	COUNTESS	Yes, Helen, you might be my daughter-in-law:
722	God shield you mean it not! daughter and mother
723	So strive upon your pulse. What, pale again?
724	My fear hath catch'd your fondness: now I see
725	The mystery of your loneliness, and find
726	Your salt tears' head: now to all sense 'tis gross
727	You love my son; invention is ashamed,
728	Against the proclamation of thy passion,
729	To say thou dost not: therefore tell me true;
730	But tell me then, 'tis so; for, look thy cheeks
731	Confess it, th' one to th' other; and thine eyes
732	See it so grossly shown in thy behaviors
733	That in their kind they speak it: only sin
734	And hellish obstinacy tie thy tongue,
735	That truth should be suspected. Speak, is't so?
736	If it be so, you have wound a goodly clew;
737	If it be not, forswear't: howe'er, I charge thee,
738	As heaven shall work in me for thine avail,
739	Tell me truly.
740	
741	HELENA	                  Good madam, pardon me!
742	
743	COUNTESS	Do you love my son?
744	
745	HELENA	Your pardon, noble mistress!
746	
747	COUNTESS	Love you my son?
748	
749	HELENA	                  Do not you love him, madam?
750	
751	COUNTESS	Go not about; my love hath in't a bond,
752	Whereof the world takes note: come, come, disclose
753	The state of your affection; for your passions
754	Have to the full appeach'd.
755	
756	HELENA	Then, I confess,
757	Here on my knee, before high heaven and you,
758	That before you, and next unto high heaven,
759	I love your son.
760	My friends were poor, but honest; so's my love:
761	Be not offended; for it hurts not him
762	That he is loved of me: I follow him not
763	By any token of presumptuous suit;
764	Nor would I have him till I do deserve him;
765	Yet never know how that desert should be.
766	I know I love in vain, strive against hope;
767	Yet in this captious and intenible sieve
768	I still pour in the waters of my love
769	And lack not to lose still: thus, Indian-like,
770	Religious in mine error, I adore
771	The sun, that looks upon his worshipper,
772	But knows of him no more. My dearest madam,
773	Let not your hate encounter with my love
774	For loving where you do: but if yourself,
775	Whose aged honour cites a virtuous youth,
776	Did ever in so true a flame of liking
777	Wish chastely and love dearly, that your Dian
778	Was both herself and love: O, then, give pity
779	To her, whose state is such that cannot choose
780	But lend and give where she is sure to lose;
781	That seeks not to find that her search implies,
782	But riddle-like lives sweetly where she dies!
783	
784	COUNTESS	Had you not lately an intent,--speak truly,--
785	To go to Paris?
786	
787	HELENA	                  Madam, I had.
788	
789	COUNTESS	Wherefore? tell true.
790	
791	HELENA	I will tell truth; by grace itself I swear.
792	You know my father left me some prescriptions
793	Of rare and proved effects, such as his reading
794	And manifest experience had collected
795	For general sovereignty; and that he will'd me
796	In heedfull'st reservation to bestow them,
797	As notes whose faculties inclusive were
798	More than they were in note: amongst the rest,
799	There is a remedy, approved, set down,
800	To cure the desperate languishings whereof
801	The king is render'd lost.
802	
803	COUNTESS	This was your motive
804	For Paris, was it? speak.
805	
806	HELENA	My lord your son made me to think of this;
807	Else Paris and the medicine and the king
808	Had from the conversation of my thoughts
809	Haply been absent then.
810	
811	COUNTESS	But think you, Helen,
812	If you should tender your supposed aid,
813	He would receive it? he and his physicians
814	Are of a mind; he, that they cannot help him,
815	They, that they cannot help: how shall they credit
816	A poor unlearned virgin, when the schools,
817	Embowell'd of their doctrine, have left off
818	The danger to itself?
819	
820	HELENA	There's something in't,
821	More than my father's skill, which was the greatest
822	Of his profession, that his good receipt
823	Shall for my legacy be sanctified
824	By the luckiest stars in heaven: and, would your honour
825	But give me leave to try success, I'ld venture
826	The well-lost life of mine on his grace's cure
827	By such a day and hour.
828	
829	COUNTESS	Dost thou believe't?
830	
831	HELENA	Ay, madam, knowingly.
832	
833	COUNTESS	Why, Helen, thou shalt have my leave and love,
834	Means and attendants and my loving greetings
835	To those of mine in court: I'll stay at home
836	And pray God's blessing into thy attempt:
837	Be gone to-morrow; and be sure of this,
838	What I can help thee to thou shalt not miss.
839	
840	[Exeunt]
841	
842	
843	
844	
845	ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
846	
847	
848	ACT II
849	
850	
851	
852	SCENE I	Paris. The KING's palace.
853	
854	
855	[Flourish of cornets. Enter the KING, attended
856	with divers young Lords taking leave for the
857	Florentine war; BERTRAM, and PAROLLES]
858	
859	KING	Farewell, young lords; these warlike principles
860	Do not throw from you: and you, my lords, farewell:
861	Share the advice betwixt you; if both gain, all
862	The gift doth stretch itself as 'tis received,
863	And is enough for both.
864	
865	First Lord	'Tis our hope, sir,
866	After well enter'd soldiers, to return
867	And find your grace in health.
868	
869	KING	No, no, it cannot be; and yet my heart
870	Will not confess he owes the malady
871	That doth my life besiege. Farewell, young lords;
872	Whether I live or die, be you the sons
873	Of worthy Frenchmen: let higher Italy,--
874	Those bated that inherit but the fall
875	Of the last monarchy,--see that you come
876	Not to woo honour, but to wed it; when
877	The bravest questant shrinks, find what you seek,
878	That fame may cry you loud: I say, farewell.
879	
880	Second Lord	Health, at your bidding, serve your majesty!
881	
882	KING	Those girls of Italy, take heed of them:
883	They say, our French lack language to deny,
884	If they demand: beware of being captives,
885	Before you serve.
886	
887	Both	                  Our hearts receive your warnings.
888	
889	KING	Farewell. Come hither to me.
890	
891	[Exit, attended]
892	
893	First Lord	O, my sweet lord, that you will stay behind us!
894	
895	PAROLLES	'Tis not his fault, the spark.
896	
897	Second Lord	O, 'tis brave wars!
898	
899	PAROLLES	Most admirable: I have seen those wars.
900	
901	BERTRAM	I am commanded here, and kept a coil with
902	'Too young' and 'the next year' and ''tis too early.'
903	
904	PAROLLES	An thy mind stand to't, boy, steal away bravely.
905	
906	BERTRAM	I shall stay here the forehorse to a smock,
907	Creaking my shoes on the plain masonry,
908	Till honour be bought up and no sword worn
909	But one to dance with! By heaven, I'll steal away.
910	
911	First Lord	There's honour in the theft.
912	
913	PAROLLES	Commit it, count.
914	
915	Second Lord	I am your accessary; and so, farewell.
916	
917	BERTRAM	I grow to you, and our parting is a tortured body.
918	
919	First Lord	Farewell, captain.
920	
921	Second Lord	Sweet Monsieur Parolles!
922	
923	PAROLLES	Noble heroes, my sword and yours are kin. Good
924	sparks and lustrous, a word, good metals: you shall
925	find in the regiment of the Spinii one Captain
926	Spurio, with his cicatrice, an emblem of war, here
927	on his sinister cheek; it was this very sword
928	entrenched it: say to him, I live; and observe his
929	reports for me.
930	
931	First Lord	We shall, noble captain.
932	
933	[Exeunt Lords]
934	
935	PAROLLES	Mars dote on you for his novices! what will ye do?
936	
937	BERTRAM	Stay: the king.
938	
939	[Re-enter KING. BERTRAM and PAROLLES retire]
940	
941	PAROLLES	[To BERTRAM]  Use a more spacious ceremony to the
942	noble lords; you have restrained yourself within the
943	list of too cold an adieu: be more expressive to
944	them: for they wear themselves in the cap of the
945	time, there do muster true gait, eat, speak, and
946	move under the influence of the most received star;
947	and though the devil lead the measure, such are to
948	be followed: after them, and take a more dilated farewell.
949	
950	BERTRAM	And I will do so.
951	
952	PAROLLES	Worthy fellows; and like to prove most sinewy sword-men.
953	
954	[Exeunt BERTRAM and PAROLLES]
955	
956	[Enter LAFEU]
957	
958	LAFEU	[Kneeling]  Pardon, my lord, for me and for my tidings.
959	
960	KING	I'll fee thee to stand up.
961	
962	LAFEU	Then here's a man stands, that has brought his pardon.
963	I would you had kneel'd, my lord, to ask me mercy,
964	And that at my bidding you could so stand up.
965	
966	KING	I would I had; so I had broke thy pate,
967	And ask'd thee mercy for't.
968	
969	LAFEU	Good faith, across: but, my good lord 'tis thus;
970	Will you be cured of your infirmity?
971	
972	KING	No.
973	
974	LAFEU	O, will you eat no grapes, my royal fox?
975	Yes, but you will my noble grapes, an if
976	My royal fox could reach them: I have seen a medicine
977	That's able to breathe life into a stone,
978	Quicken a rock, and make you dance canary
979	With spritely fire and motion; whose simple touch,
980	Is powerful to araise King Pepin, nay,
981	To give great Charlemain a pen in's hand,
982	And write to her a love-line.
983	
984	KING	What 'her' is this?
985	
986	LAFEU	Why, Doctor She: my lord, there's one arrived,
987	If you will see her: now, by my faith and honour,
988	If seriously I may convey my thoughts
989	In this my light deliverance, I have spoke
990	With one that, in her sex, her years, profession,
991	Wisdom and constancy, hath amazed me more
992	Than I dare blame my weakness: will you see her
993	For that is her demand, and know her business?
994	That done, laugh well at me.
995	
996	KING	Now, good Lafeu,
997	Bring in the admiration; that we with thee
998	May spend our wonder too, or take off thine
999	By wondering how thou took'st it.
1000	
1001	LAFEU	Nay, I'll fit you,
1002	And not be all day neither.
1003	
1004	[Exit]
1005	
1006	KING	Thus he his special nothing ever prologues.
1007	
1008	[Re-enter LAFEU, with HELENA]
1009	
1010	LAFEU	Nay, come your ways.
1011	
1012	KING	This haste hath wings indeed.
1013	
1014	LAFEU	Nay, come your ways:
1015	This is his majesty; say your mind to him:
1016	A traitor you do look like; but such traitors
1017	His majesty seldom fears: I am Cressid's uncle,
1018	That dare leave two together; fare you well.
1019	
1020	[Exit]
1021	
1022	KING	Now, fair one, does your business follow us?
1023	
1024	HELENA	Ay, my good lord.
1025	Gerard de Narbon was my father;
1026	In what he did profess, well found.
1027	
1028	KING	I knew him.
1029	
1030	HELENA	The rather will I spare my praises towards him:
1031	Knowing him is enough. On's bed of death
1032	Many receipts he gave me: chiefly one.
1033	Which, as the dearest issue of his practise,
1034	And of his old experience the oily darling,
1035	He bade me store up, as a triple eye,
1036	Safer than mine own two, more dear; I have so;
1037	And hearing your high majesty is touch'd
1038	With that malignant cause wherein the honour
1039	Of my dear father's gift stands chief in power,
1040	I come to tender it and my appliance
1041	With all bound humbleness.
1042	
1043	KING	We thank you, maiden;
1044	But may not be so credulous of cure,
1045	When our most learned doctors leave us and
1046	The congregated college have concluded
1047	That labouring art can never ransom nature
1048	From her inaidible estate; I say we must not
1049	So stain our judgment, or corrupt our hope,
1050	To prostitute our past-cure malady
1051	To empirics, or to dissever so
1052	Our great self and our credit, to esteem
1053	A senseless help when help past sense we deem.
1054	
1055	HELENA	My duty then shall pay me for my pains:
1056	I will no more enforce mine office on you.
1057	Humbly entreating from your royal thoughts
1058	A modest one, to bear me back a again.
1059	
1060	KING	I cannot give thee less, to be call'd grateful:
1061	Thou thought'st to help me; and such thanks I give
1062	As one near death to those that wish him live:
1063	But what at full I know, thou know'st no part,
1064	I knowing all my peril, thou no art.
1065	
1066	HELENA	What I can do can do no hurt to try,
1067	Since you set up your rest 'gainst remedy.
1068	He that of greatest works is finisher
1069	Oft does them by the weakest minister:
1070	So holy writ in babes hath judgment shown,
1071	When judges have been babes; great floods have flown
1072	From simple sources, and great seas have dried
1073	When miracles have by the greatest been denied.
1074	Oft expectation fails and most oft there
1075	Where most it promises, and oft it hits
1076	Where hope is coldest and despair most fits.
1077	
1078	KING	I must not hear thee; fare thee well, kind maid;
1079	Thy pains not used must by thyself be paid:
1080	Proffers not took reap thanks for their reward.
1081	
1082	HELENA	Inspired merit so by breath is barr'd:
1083	It is not so with Him that all things knows
1084	As 'tis with us that square our guess by shows;
1085	But most it is presumption in us when
1086	The help of heaven we count the act of men.
1087	Dear sir, to my endeavours give consent;
1088	Of heaven, not me, make an experiment.
1089	I am not an impostor that proclaim
1090	Myself against the level of mine aim;
1091	But know I think and think I know most sure
1092	My art is not past power nor you past cure.
1093	
1094	KING	Are thou so confident? within what space
1095	Hopest thou my cure?
1096	
1097	HELENA	The great'st grace lending grace
1098	Ere twice the horses of the sun shall bring
1099	Their fiery torcher his diurnal ring,
1100	Ere twice in murk and occidental damp
1101	Moist Hesperus hath quench'd his sleepy lamp,
1102	Or four and twenty times the pilot's glass
1103	Hath told the thievish minutes how they pass,
1104	What is infirm from your sound parts shall fly,
1105	Health shall live free and sickness freely die.
1106	
1107	KING	Upon thy certainty and confidence
1108	What darest thou venture?
1109	
1110	HELENA	Tax of impudence,
1111	A strumpet's boldness, a divulged shame
1112	Traduced by odious ballads: my maiden's name
1113	Sear'd otherwise; nay, worse--if worse--extended
1114	With vilest torture let my life be ended.
1115	
1116	KING	Methinks in thee some blessed spirit doth speak
1117	His powerful sound within an organ weak:
1118	And what impossibility would slay
1119	In common sense, sense saves another way.
1120	Thy life is dear; for all that life can rate
1121	Worth name of life in thee hath estimate,
1122	Youth, beauty, wisdom, courage, all
1123	That happiness and prime can happy call:
1124	Thou this to hazard needs must intimate
1125	Skill infinite or monstrous desperate.
1126	Sweet practiser, thy physic I will try,
1127	That ministers thine own death if I die.
1128	
1129	HELENA	If I break time, or flinch in property
1130	Of what I spoke, unpitied let me die,
1131	And well deserved: not helping, death's my fee;
1132	But, if I help, what do you promise me?
1133	
1134	KING	Make thy demand.
1135	
1136	HELENA	                  But will you make it even?
1137	
1138	KING	Ay, by my sceptre and my hopes of heaven.
1139	
1140	HELENA	Then shalt thou give me with thy kingly hand
1141	What husband in thy power I will command:
1142	Exempted be from me the arrogance
1143	To choose from forth the royal blood of France,
1144	My low and humble name to propagate
1145	With any branch or image of thy state;
1146	But such a one, thy vassal, whom I know
1147	Is free for me to ask, thee to bestow.
1148	
1149	KING	Here is my hand; the premises observed,
1150	Thy will by my performance shall be served:
1151	So make the choice of thy own time, for I,
1152	Thy resolved patient, on thee still rely.
1153	More should I question thee, and more I must,
1154	Though more to know could not be more to trust,
1155	From whence thou camest, how tended on: but rest
1156	Unquestion'd welcome and undoubted blest.
1157	Give me some help here, ho! If thou proceed
1158	As high as word, my deed shall match thy meed.
1159

1168	ACT II
1169	
1170	
1171	
1172	SCENE II	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
1173	
1174	
1175	[Enter COUNTESS and Clown]
1176	
1177	COUNTESS	Come on, sir; I shall now put you to the height of
1178	your breeding.
1179	
1180	Clown	I will show myself highly fed and lowly taught: I
1181	know my business is but to the court.
1182	
1183	COUNTESS	To the court! why, what place make you special,
1184	when you put off that with such contempt? But to the court!
1185	
1186	Clown	Truly, madam, if God have lent a man any manners, he
1187	may easily put it off at court: he that cannot make
1188	a leg, put off's cap, kiss his hand and say nothing,
1189	has neither leg, hands, lip, nor cap; and indeed
1190	such a fellow, to say precisely, were not for the
1191	court; but for me, I have an answer will serve all
1192	men.
1193	
1194	COUNTESS	Marry, that's a bountiful answer that fits all
1195	questions.
1196	
1197	Clown	It is like a barber's chair that fits all buttocks,
1198	the pin-buttock, the quatch-buttock, the brawn
1199	buttock, or any buttock.
1200	
1201	COUNTESS	Will your answer serve fit to all questions?
1202	
1203	Clown	As fit as ten groats is for the hand of an attorney,
1204	as your French crown for your taffeta punk, as Tib's
1205	rush for Tom's forefinger, as a pancake for Shrove
1206	Tuesday, a morris for May-day, as the nail to his
1207	hole, the cuckold to his horn, as a scolding queen
1208	to a wrangling knave, as the nun's lip to the
1209	friar's mouth, nay, as the pudding to his skin.
1210	
1211	COUNTESS	Have you, I say, an answer of such fitness for all
1212	questions?
1213	
1214	Clown	From below your duke to beneath your constable, it
1215	will fit any question.
1216	
1217	COUNTESS	It must be an answer of most monstrous size that
1218	must fit all demands.
1219	
1220	Clown	But a trifle neither, in good faith, if the learned
1221	should speak truth of it: here it is, and all that
1222	belongs to't. Ask me if I am a courtier: it shall
1223	do you no harm to learn.
1224	
1225	COUNTESS	To be young again, if we could: I will be a fool in
1226	question, hoping to be the wiser by your answer. I
1227	pray you, sir, are you a courtier?
1228	
1229	Clown	O Lord, sir! There's a simple putting off. More,
1230	more, a hundred of them.
1231	
1232	COUNTESS	Sir, I am a poor friend of yours, that loves you.
1233	
1234	Clown	O Lord, sir! Thick, thick, spare not me.
1235	
1236	COUNTESS	I think, sir, you can eat none of this homely meat.
1237	
1238	Clown	O Lord, sir! Nay, put me to't, I warrant you.
1239	
1240	COUNTESS	You were lately whipped, sir, as I think.
1241	
1242	Clown	O Lord, sir! spare not me.
1243	
1244	COUNTESS	Do you cry, 'O Lord, sir!' at your whipping, and
1245	'spare not me?' Indeed your 'O Lord, sir!' is very
1246	sequent to your whipping: you would answer very well
1247	to a whipping, if you were but bound to't.
1248	
1249	Clown	I ne'er had worse luck in my life in my 'O Lord,
1250	sir!' I see things may serve long, but not serve ever.
1251	
1252	COUNTESS	I play the noble housewife with the time
1253	To entertain't so merrily with a fool.
1254	
1255	Clown	O Lord, sir! why, there't serves well again.
1256	
1257	COUNTESS	An end, sir; to your business. Give Helen this,
1258	And urge her to a present answer back:
1259	Commend me to my kinsmen and my son:
1260	This is not much.
1261	
1262	Clown	Not much commendation to them.
1263	
1264	COUNTESS	Not much employment for you: you understand me?
1265	
1266	Clown	Most fruitfully: I am there before my legs.
1267	
1268	COUNTESS	Haste you again.
1269	
1270	[Exeunt severally]

1278	ACT II

1280	
1281	
1282	SCENE III	Paris. The KING's palace.
1283	
1284	
1285	[Enter BERTRAM, LAFEU, and PAROLLES]
1286	
1287	LAFEU	They say miracles are past; and we have our
1288	philosophical persons, to make modern and familiar,
1289	things supernatural and causeless. Hence is it that
1290	we make trifles of terrors, ensconcing ourselves
1291	into seeming knowledge, when we should submit
1292	ourselves to an unknown fear.
1293	
1294	PAROLLES	Why, 'tis the rarest argument of wonder that hath
1295	shot out in our latter times.
1296	
1297	BERTRAM	And so 'tis.
1298	
1299	LAFEU	To be relinquish'd of the artists,--
1300	
1301	PAROLLES	So I say.
1302	
1303	LAFEU	Both of Galen and Paracelsus.
1304	
1305	PAROLLES	So I say.
1306	
1307	LAFEU	Of all the learned and authentic fellows,--
1308	
1309	PAROLLES	Right; so I say.
1310	
1311	LAFEU	That gave him out incurable,--
1312	
1313	PAROLLES	Why, there 'tis; so say I too.
1314	
1315	LAFEU	Not to be helped,--
1316	
1317	PAROLLES	Right; as 'twere, a man assured of a--
1318	
1319	LAFEU	Uncertain life, and sure death.
1320	
1321	PAROLLES	Just, you say well; so would I have said.
1322	
1323	LAFEU	I may truly say, it is a novelty to the world.
1324	
1325	PAROLLES	It is, indeed: if you will have it in showing, you
1326	shall read it in--what do you call there?
1327	
1328	LAFEU	A showing of a heavenly effect in an earthly actor.
1329	
1330	PAROLLES	That's it; I would have said the very same.
1331	
1332	LAFEU	Why, your dolphin is not lustier: 'fore me,
1333	I speak in respect--
1334	
1335	PAROLLES	Nay, 'tis strange, 'tis very strange, that is the
1336	brief and the tedious of it; and he's of a most
1337	facinerious spirit that will not acknowledge it to be the--
1338	
1339	LAFEU	Very hand of heaven.
1340	
1341	PAROLLES	Ay, so I say.
1342	
1343	LAFEU	In a most weak--
1344	
1345	[pausing]
1346	
1347	and debile minister, great power, great
1348	transcendence: which should, indeed, give us a
1349	further use to be made than alone the recovery of
1350	the king, as to be--
1351	
1352	[pausing]
1353	
1354	generally thankful.
1355	
1356	PAROLLES	I would have said it; you say well. Here comes the king.
1357	
1358	[Enter KING, HELENA, and Attendants. LAFEU and
1359	PAROLLES retire]
1360	
1361	LAFEU	Lustig, as the Dutchman says: I'll like a maid the
1362	better, whilst I have a tooth in my head: why, he's
1363	able to lead her a coranto.
1364	
1365	PAROLLES	Mort du vinaigre! is not this Helen?
1366	
1367	LAFEU	'Fore God, I think so.
1368	
1369	KING	Go, call before me all the lords in court.
1370	Sit, my preserver, by thy patient's side;
1371	And with this healthful hand, whose banish'd sense
1372	Thou hast repeal'd, a second time receive
1373	The confirmation of my promised gift,
1374	Which but attends thy naming.
1375	
1376	[Enter three or four Lords]
1377	
1378	Fair maid, send forth thine eye: this youthful parcel
1379	Of noble bachelors stand at my bestowing,
1380	O'er whom both sovereign power and father's voice
1381	I have to use: thy frank election make;
1382	Thou hast power to choose, and they none to forsake.
1383	
1384	HELENA	To each of you one fair and virtuous mistress
1385	Fall, when Love please! marry, to each, but one!
1386	
1387	LAFEU	I'ld give bay Curtal and his furniture,
1388	My mouth no more were broken than these boys',
1389	And writ as little beard.
1390	
1391	KING	Peruse them well:
1392	Not one of those but had a noble father.
1393	
1394	HELENA	Gentlemen,
1395	Heaven hath through me restored the king to health.
1396	
1397	All	We understand it, and thank heaven for you.
1398	
1399	HELENA	I am a simple maid, and therein wealthiest,
1400	That I protest I simply am a maid.
1401	Please it your majesty, I have done already:
1402	The blushes in my cheeks thus whisper me,
1403	'We blush that thou shouldst choose; but, be refused,
1404	Let the white death sit on thy cheek for ever;
1405	We'll ne'er come there again.'
1406	
1407	KING	Make choice; and, see,
1408	Who shuns thy love shuns all his love in me.
1409	
1410	HELENA	Now, Dian, from thy altar do I fly,
1411	And to imperial Love, that god most high,
1412	Do my sighs stream. Sir, will you hear my suit?
1413	
1414	First Lord	And grant it.
1415	
1416	HELENA	                  Thanks, sir; all the rest is mute.
1417	
1418	LAFEU	I had rather be in this choice than throw ames-ace
1419	for my life.
1420	
1421	HELENA	The honour, sir, that flames in your fair eyes,
1422	Before I speak, too threateningly replies:
1423	Love make your fortunes twenty times above
1424	Her that so wishes and her humble love!
1425	
1426	Second Lord	No better, if you please.
1427	
1428	HELENA	My wish receive,
1429	Which great Love grant! and so, I take my leave.
1430	
1431	LAFEU	Do all they deny her? An they were sons of mine,
1432	I'd have them whipped; or I would send them to the
1433	Turk, to make eunuchs of.
1434	
1435	HELENA	Be not afraid that I your hand should take;
1436	I'll never do you wrong for your own sake:
1437	Blessing upon your vows! and in your bed
1438	Find fairer fortune, if you ever wed!
1439	
1440	LAFEU	These boys are boys of ice, they'll none have her:
1441	sure, they are bastards to the English; the French
1442	ne'er got 'em.
1443	
1444	HELENA	You are too young, too happy, and too good,
1445	To make yourself a son out of my blood.
1446	
1447	Fourth Lord	Fair one, I think not so.
1448	
1449	LAFEU	There's one grape yet; I am sure thy father drunk
1450	wine: but if thou be'st not an ass, I am a youth
1451	of fourteen; I have known thee already.
1452	
1453	HELENA	[To BERTRAM]  I dare not say I take you; but I give
1454	Me and my service, ever whilst I live,
1455	Into your guiding power. This is the man.
1456	
1457	KING	Why, then, young Bertram, take her; she's thy wife.
1458	
1459	BERTRAM	My wife, my liege! I shall beseech your highness,
1460	In such a business give me leave to use
1461	The help of mine own eyes.
1462	
1463	KING	Know'st thou not, Bertram,
1464	What she has done for me?
1465	
1466	BERTRAM	Yes, my good lord;
1467	But never hope to know why I should marry her.
1468	
1469	KING	Thou know'st she has raised me from my sickly bed.
1470	
1471	BERTRAM	But follows it, my lord, to bring me down
1472	Must answer for your raising? I know her well:
1473	She had her breeding at my father's charge.
1474	A poor physician's daughter my wife! Disdain
1475	Rather corrupt me ever!
1476	
1477	KING	'Tis only title thou disdain'st in her, the which
1478	I can build up. Strange is it that our bloods,
1479	Of colour, weight, and heat, pour'd all together,
1480	Would quite confound distinction, yet stand off
1481	In differences so mighty. If she be
1482	All that is virtuous, save what thou dislikest,
1483	A poor physician's daughter, thou dislikest
1484	Of virtue for the name: but do not so:
1485	From lowest place when virtuous things proceed,
1486	The place is dignified by the doer's deed:
1487	Where great additions swell's, and virtue none,
1488	It is a dropsied honour. Good alone
1489	Is good without a name. Vileness is so:
1490	The property by what it is should go,
1491	Not by the title. She is young, wise, fair;
1492	In these to nature she's immediate heir,
1493	And these breed honour: that is honour's scorn,
1494	Which challenges itself as honour's born
1495	And is not like the sire: honours thrive,
1496	When rather from our acts we them derive
1497	Than our foregoers: the mere word's a slave
1498	Debosh'd on every tomb, on every grave
1499	A lying trophy, and as oft is dumb
1500	Where dust and damn'd oblivion is the tomb
1501	Of honour'd bones indeed. What should be said?
1502	If thou canst like this creature as a maid,
1503	I can create the rest: virtue and she
1504	Is her own dower; honour and wealth from me.
1505	
1506	BERTRAM	I cannot love her, nor will strive to do't.
1507	
1508	KING	Thou wrong'st thyself, if thou shouldst strive to choose.
1509	
1510	HELENA	That you are well restored, my lord, I'm glad:
1511	Let the rest go.
1512	
1513	KING	My honour's at the stake; which to defeat,
1514	I must produce my power. Here, take her hand,
1515	Proud scornful boy, unworthy this good gift;
1516	That dost in vile misprision shackle up
1517	My love and her desert; that canst not dream,
1518	We, poising us in her defective scale,
1519	Shall weigh thee to the beam; that wilt not know,
1520	It is in us to plant thine honour where
1521	We please to have it grow. Cheque thy contempt:
1522	Obey our will, which travails in thy good:
1523	Believe not thy disdain, but presently
1524	Do thine own fortunes that obedient right
1525	Which both thy duty owes and our power claims;
1526	Or I will throw thee from my care for ever
1527	Into the staggers and the careless lapse
1528	Of youth and ignorance; both my revenge and hate
1529	Loosing upon thee, in the name of justice,
1530	Without all terms of pity. Speak; thine answer.
1531	
1532	BERTRAM	Pardon, my gracious lord; for I submit
1533	My fancy to your eyes: when I consider
1534	What great creation and what dole of honour
1535	Flies where you bid it, I find that she, which late
1536	Was in my nobler thoughts most base, is now
1537	The praised of the king; who, so ennobled,
1538	Is as 'twere born so.
1539	
1540	KING	Take her by the hand,
1541	And tell her she is thine: to whom I promise
1542	A counterpoise, if not to thy estate
1543	A balance more replete.
1544	
1545	BERTRAM	I take her hand.
1546	
1547	KING	Good fortune and the favour of the king
1548	Smile upon this contract; whose ceremony
1549	Shall seem expedient on the now-born brief,
1550	And be perform'd to-night: the solemn feast
1551	Shall more attend upon the coming space,
1552	Expecting absent friends. As thou lovest her,
1553	Thy love's to me religious; else, does err.
1554	
1555	[Exeunt all but LAFEU and PAROLLES]
1556	
1557	LAFEU	[Advancing]  Do you hear, monsieur? a word with you.
1558	
1559	PAROLLES	Your pleasure, sir?
1560	
1561	LAFEU	Your lord and master did well to make his
1562	recantation.
1563	
1564	PAROLLES	Recantation! My lord! my master!
1565	
1566	LAFEU	Ay; is it not a language I speak?
1567	
1568	PAROLLES	A most harsh one, and not to be understood without
1569	bloody succeeding. My master!
1570	
1571	LAFEU	Are you companion to the Count Rousillon?
1572	
1573	PAROLLES	To any count, to all counts, to what is man.
1574	
1575	LAFEU	To what is count's man: count's master is of
1576	another style.
1577	
1578	PAROLLES	You are too old, sir; let it satisfy you, you are too old.
1579	
1580	LAFEU	I must tell thee, sirrah, I write man; to which
1581	title age cannot bring thee.
1582	
1583	PAROLLES	What I dare too well do, I dare not do.
1584	
1585	LAFEU	I did think thee, for two ordinaries, to be a pretty
1586	wise fellow; thou didst make tolerable vent of thy
1587	travel; it might pass: yet the scarfs and the
1588	bannerets about thee did manifoldly dissuade me from
1589	believing thee a vessel of too great a burthen. I
1590	have now found thee; when I lose thee again, I care
1591	not: yet art thou good for nothing but taking up; and
1592	that thou't scarce worth.
1593	
1594	PAROLLES	Hadst thou not the privilege of antiquity upon thee,--
1595	
1596	LAFEU	Do not plunge thyself too far in anger, lest thou
1597	hasten thy trial; which if--Lord have mercy on thee
1598	for a hen! So, my good window of lattice, fare thee
1599	well: thy casement I need not open, for I look
1600	through thee. Give me thy hand.
1601	
1602	PAROLLES	My lord, you give me most egregious indignity.
1603	
1604	LAFEU	Ay, with all my heart; and thou art worthy of it.
1605	
1606	PAROLLES	I have not, my lord, deserved it.
1607	
1608	LAFEU	Yes, good faith, every dram of it; and I will not
1609	bate thee a scruple.
1610	
1611	PAROLLES	Well, I shall be wiser.
1612	
1613	LAFEU	Even as soon as thou canst, for thou hast to pull at
1614	a smack o' the contrary. If ever thou be'st bound
1615	in thy scarf and beaten, thou shalt find what it is
1616	to be proud of thy bondage. I have a desire to hold
1617	my acquaintance with thee, or rather my knowledge,
1618	that I may say in the default, he is a man I know.
1619	
1620	PAROLLES	My lord, you do me most insupportable vexation.
1621	
1622	LAFEU	I would it were hell-pains for thy sake, and my poor
1623	doing eternal: for doing I am past: as I will by
1624	thee, in what motion age will give me leave.
1625	
1626	[Exit]
1627	
1628	PAROLLES	Well, thou hast a son shall take this disgrace off
1629	me; scurvy, old, filthy, scurvy lord! Well, I must
1630	be patient; there is no fettering of authority.
1631	I'll beat him, by my life, if I can meet him with
1632	any convenience, an he were double and double a
1633	lord. I'll have no more pity of his age than I
1634	would of--I'll beat him, an if I could but meet him again.
1635	
1636	[Re-enter LAFEU]
1637	
1638	LAFEU	Sirrah, your lord and master's married; there's news
1639	for you: you have a new mistress.
1640	
1641	PAROLLES	I most unfeignedly beseech your lordship to make
1642	some reservation of your wrongs: he is my good
1643	lord: whom I serve above is my master.
1644	
1645	LAFEU	Who? God?
1646	
1647	PAROLLES	Ay, sir.
1648	
1649	LAFEU	The devil it is that's thy master. Why dost thou
1650	garter up thy arms o' this fashion? dost make hose of
1651	sleeves? do other servants so? Thou wert best set
1652	thy lower part where thy nose stands. By mine
1653	honour, if I were but two hours younger, I'ld beat
1654	thee: methinks, thou art a general offence, and
1655	every man should beat thee: I think thou wast
1656	created for men to breathe themselves upon thee.
1657	
1658	PAROLLES	This is hard and undeserved measure, my lord.
1659	
1660	LAFEU	Go to, sir; you were beaten in Italy for picking a
1661	kernel out of a pomegranate; you are a vagabond and
1662	no true traveller: you are more saucy with lords
1663	and honourable personages than the commission of your
1664	birth and virtue gives you heraldry. You are not
1665	worth another word, else I'ld call you knave. I leave you.
1666	
1667	[Exit]
1668	
1669	PAROLLES	Good, very good; it is so then: good, very good;
1670	let it be concealed awhile.
1671	
1672	[Re-enter BERTRAM]
1673	
1674	BERTRAM	Undone, and forfeited to cares for ever!
1675	
1676	PAROLLES	What's the matter, sweet-heart?
1677	
1678	BERTRAM	Although before the solemn priest I have sworn,
1679	I will not bed her.
1680	
1681	PAROLLES	What, what, sweet-heart?
1682	
1683	BERTRAM	O my Parolles, they have married me!
1684	I'll to the Tuscan wars, and never bed her.
1685	
1686	PAROLLES	France is a dog-hole, and it no more merits
1687	The tread of a man's foot: to the wars!
1688	
1689	BERTRAM	There's letters from my mother: what the import is,
1690	I know not yet.
1691	
1692	PAROLLES	Ay, that would be known. To the wars, my boy, to the wars!
1693	He wears his honour in a box unseen,
1694	That hugs his kicky-wicky here at home,
1695	Spending his manly marrow in her arms,
1696	Which should sustain the bound and high curvet
1697	Of Mars's fiery steed. To other regions
1698	France is a stable; we that dwell in't jades;
1699	Therefore, to the war!
1700	
1701	BERTRAM	It shall be so: I'll send her to my house,
1702	Acquaint my mother with my hate to her,
1703	And wherefore I am fled; write to the king
1704	That which I durst not speak; his present gift
1705	Shall furnish me to those Italian fields,
1706	Where noble fellows strike: war is no strife
1707	To the dark house and the detested wife.
1708	
1709	PAROLLES	Will this capriccio hold in thee? art sure?
1710	
1711	BERTRAM	Go with me to my chamber, and advise me.
1712	I'll send her straight away: to-morrow
1713	I'll to the wars, she to her single sorrow.
1714	
1715	PAROLLES	Why, these balls bound; there's noise in it. 'Tis hard:
1716	A young man married is a man that's marr'd:
1717	Therefore away, and leave her bravely; go:
1718	The king has done you wrong: but, hush, 'tis so.

1735	[Enter HELENA and Clown]
1736	
1737	HELENA	My mother greets me kindly; is she well?
1738	
1739	Clown	She is not well; but yet she has her health: she's
1740	very merry; but yet she is not well: but thanks be
1741	given, she's very well and wants nothing i', the
1742	world; but yet she is not well.
1743	
1744	HELENA	If she be very well, what does she ail, that she's
1745	not very well?
1746	
1747	Clown	Truly, she's very well indeed, but for two things.
1748	
1749	HELENA	What two things?
1750	
1751	Clown	One, that she's not in heaven, whither God send her
1752	quickly! the other that she's in earth, from whence
1753	God send her quickly!
1754	
1755	[Enter PAROLLES]
1756	
1757	PAROLLES	Bless you, my fortunate lady!
1758	
1759	HELENA	I hope, sir, I have your good will to have mine own
1760	good fortunes.
1761	
1762	PAROLLES	You had my prayers to lead them on; and to keep them
1763	on, have them still. O, my knave, how does my old lady?
1764	
1765	Clown	So that you had her wrinkles and I her money,
1766	I would she did as you say.
1767	
1768	PAROLLES	Why, I say nothing.
1769	
1770	Clown	Marry, you are the wiser man; for many a man's
1771	tongue shakes out his master's undoing: to say
1772	nothing, to do nothing, to know nothing, and to have
1773	nothing, is to be a great part of your title; which
1774	is within a very little of nothing.
1775	
1776	PAROLLES	Away! thou'rt a knave.
1777	
1778	Clown	You should have said, sir, before a knave thou'rt a
1779	knave; that's, before me thou'rt a knave: this had
1780	been truth, sir.
1781	
1782	PAROLLES	Go to, thou art a witty fool; I have found thee.
1783	
1784	Clown	Did you find me in yourself, sir? or were you
1785	taught to find me? The search, sir, was profitable;
1786	and much fool may you find in you, even to the
1787	world's pleasure and the increase of laughter.
1788	
1789	PAROLLES	A good knave, i' faith, and well fed.
1790	Madam, my lord will go away to-night;
1791	A very serious business calls on him.
1792	The great prerogative and rite of love,
1793	Which, as your due, time claims, he does acknowledge;
1794	But puts it off to a compell'd restraint;
1795	Whose want, and whose delay, is strew'd with sweets,
1796	Which they distil now in the curbed time,
1797	To make the coming hour o'erflow with joy
1798	And pleasure drown the brim.
1799	
1800	HELENA	What's his will else?
1801	
1802	PAROLLES	That you will take your instant leave o' the king
1803	And make this haste as your own good proceeding,
1804	Strengthen'd with what apology you think
1805	May make it probable need.
1806	
1807	HELENA	What more commands he?
1808	
1809	PAROLLES	That, having this obtain'd, you presently
1810	Attend his further pleasure.
1811	
1812	HELENA	In every thing I wait upon his will.
1813	
1814	PAROLLES	I shall report it so.

1835	
1836	
1837	[Enter LAFEU and BERTRAM]
1838	
1839	LAFEU	But I hope your lordship thinks not him a soldier.
1840	
1841	BERTRAM	Yes, my lord, and of very valiant approof.
1842	
1843	LAFEU	You have it from his own deliverance.
1844	
1845	BERTRAM	And by other warranted testimony.
1846	
1847	LAFEU	Then my dial goes not true: I took this lark for a bunting.
1848	
1849	BERTRAM	I do assure you, my lord, he is very great in
1850	knowledge and accordingly valiant.
1851	
1852	LAFEU	I have then sinned against his experience and
1853	transgressed against his valour; and my state that
1854	way is dangerous, since I cannot yet find in my
1855	heart to repent. Here he comes: I pray you, make
1856	us friends; I will pursue the amity.
1857	
1858	[Enter PAROLLES]
1859	
1860	PAROLLES	[To BERTRAM]  These things shall be done, sir.
1861	
1862	LAFEU	Pray you, sir, who's his tailor?
1863	
1864	PAROLLES	Sir?
1865	
1866	LAFEU	O, I know him well, I, sir; he, sir, 's a good
1867	workman, a very good tailor.
1868	
1869	BERTRAM	[Aside to PAROLLES]  Is she gone to the king?
1870	
1871	PAROLLES	She is.
1872	
1873	BERTRAM	Will she away to-night?
1874	
1875	PAROLLES	As you'll have her.
1876	
1877	BERTRAM	I have writ my letters, casketed my treasure,
1878	Given order for our horses; and to-night,
1879	When I should take possession of the bride,
1880	End ere I do begin.
1881	
1882	LAFEU	A good traveller is something at the latter end of a
1883	dinner; but one that lies three thirds and uses a
1884	known truth to pass a thousand nothings with, should
1885	be once heard and thrice beaten. God save you, captain.
1886	
1887	BERTRAM	Is there any unkindness between my lord and you, monsieur?
1888	
1889	PAROLLES	I know not how I have deserved to run into my lord's
1890	displeasure.
1891	
1892	LAFEU	You have made shift to run into 't, boots and spurs
1893	and all, like him that leaped into the custard; and
1894	out of it you'll run again, rather than suffer
1895	question for your residence.
1896	
1897	BERTRAM	It may be you have mistaken him, my lord.
1898	
1899	LAFEU	And shall do so ever, though I took him at 's
1900	prayers. Fare you well, my lord; and believe this
1901	of me, there can be no kernel in this light nut; the
1902	soul of this man is his clothes. Trust him not in
1903	matter of heavy consequence; I have kept of them
1904	tame, and know their natures. Farewell, monsieur:
1905	I have spoken better of you than you have or will to
1906	deserve at my hand; but we must do good against evil.
1907	
1908	[Exit]
1909	
1910	PAROLLES	An idle lord. I swear.
1911	
1912	BERTRAM	I think so.
1913	
1914	PAROLLES	Why, do you not know him?
1915	
1916	BERTRAM	Yes, I do know him well, and common speech
1917	Gives him a worthy pass. Here comes my clog.
1918	
1919	[Enter HELENA]
1920	
1921	HELENA	I have, sir, as I was commanded from you,
1922	Spoke with the king and have procured his leave
1923	For present parting; only he desires
1924	Some private speech with you.
1925	
1926	BERTRAM	I shall obey his will.
1927	You must not marvel, Helen, at my course,
1928	Which holds not colour with the time, nor does
1929	The ministration and required office
1930	On my particular. Prepared I was not
1931	For such a business; therefore am I found
1932	So much unsettled: this drives me to entreat you
1933	That presently you take our way for home;
1934	And rather muse than ask why I entreat you,
1935	For my respects are better than they seem
1936	And my appointments have in them a need
1937	Greater than shows itself at the first view
1938	To you that know them not. This to my mother:
1939	
1940	[Giving a letter]
1941	
1942	'Twill be two days ere I shall see you, so
1943	I leave you to your wisdom.
1944	
1945	HELENA	Sir, I can nothing say,
1946	But that I am your most obedient servant.
1947	
1948	BERTRAM	Come, come, no more of that.
1949	
1950	HELENA	And ever shall
1951	With true observance seek to eke out that
1952	Wherein toward me my homely stars have fail'd
1953	To equal my great fortune.
1954	
1955	BERTRAM	Let that go:
1956	My haste is very great: farewell; hie home.
1957	
1958	HELENA	Pray, sir, your pardon.
1959	
1960	BERTRAM	Well, what would you say?
1961	
1962	HELENA	I am not worthy of the wealth I owe,
1963	Nor dare I say 'tis mine, and yet it is;
1964	But, like a timorous thief, most fain would steal
1965	What law does vouch mine own.
1966	
1967	BERTRAM	What would you have?
1968	
1969	HELENA	Something; and scarce so much: nothing, indeed.
1970	I would not tell you what I would, my lord:
1971	Faith yes;
1972	Strangers and foes do sunder, and not kiss.
1973	
1974	BERTRAM	I pray you, stay not, but in haste to horse.
1975	
1976	HELENA	I shall not break your bidding, good my lord.
1977	
1978	BERTRAM	Where are my other men, monsieur? Farewell.
1979	
1980	[Exit HELENA]
1981	
1982	Go thou toward home; where I will never come
1983	Whilst I can shake my sword or hear the drum.
1984	Away, and for our flight.

2012	Upon your grace's part; black and fearful
2013	On the opposer.
2014	
2015	DUKE	Therefore we marvel much our cousin France
2016	Would in so just a business shut his bosom
2017	Against our borrowing prayers.
2018	
2019	Second Lord	Good my lord,
2020	The reasons of our state I cannot yield,
2021	But like a common and an outward man,
2022	That the great figure of a council frames
2023	By self-unable motion: therefore dare not
2024	Say what I think of it, since I have found

2029

2032	Come here for physic.
2033	
2034	DUKE	Welcome shall they be;

2060	Clown	By my troth, I take my young lord to be a very
2061	melancholy man.
2062	
2063	COUNTESS	By what observance, I pray you?
2064	
2065	Clown	Why, he will look upon his boot and sing; mend the
2066	ruff and sing; ask questions and sing; pick his
2067	teeth and sing. I know a man that had this trick of
2068	melancholy sold a goodly manor for a song.
2069	
2070	COUNTESS	Let me see what he writes, and when he means to come.
2071	
2072	[Opening a letter]
2073	
2074	Clown	I have no mind to Isbel since I was at court: our
2075	old ling and our Isbels o' the country are nothing
2076	like your old ling and your Isbels o' the court:
2077	the brains of my Cupid's knocked out, and I begin to
2078	love, as an old man loves money, with no stomach.
2079	
2080	COUNTESS	What have we here?

2082	Clown	E'en that you have there.
2083	
2084	[Exit]
2085	
2086	COUNTESS	[Reads]  I have sent you a daughter-in-law: she hath
2087	recovered the king, and undone me. I have wedded
2088	her, not bedded her; and sworn to make the 'not'
2089	eternal. You shall hear I am run away: know it
2090	before the report come. If there be breadth enough
2091	in the world, I will hold a long distance. My duty
2092	to you.	Your unfortunate son,
2093	BERTRAM.
2094	This is not well, rash and unbridled boy.
2095	To fly the favours of so good a king;
2096	To pluck his indignation on thy head
2097	By the misprising of a maid too virtuous
2098	For the contempt of empire.

2100	[Re-enter Clown]
2101	
2102	Clown	O madam, yonder is heavy news within between two
2103	soldiers and my young lady!
2104	
2105	COUNTESS	What is the matter?
2106	
2107	Clown	Nay, there is some comfort in the news, some
2108	comfort; your son will not be killed so soon as I
2109	thought he would.
2110	
2111	COUNTESS	Why should he be killed?
2112	
2113	Clown	So say I, madam, if he run away, as I hear he does:
2114	the danger is in standing to't; that's the loss of
2115	men, though it be the getting of children. Here
2116	they come will tell you more: for my part, I only
2117	hear your son was run away.

2125	HELENA	Madam, my lord is gone, for ever gone.
2126	
2127	Second Gentleman	Do not say so.
2128	
2129	COUNTESS	Think upon patience. Pray you, gentlemen,
2130	I have felt so many quirks of joy and grief,
2131	That the first face of neither, on the start,
2132	Can woman me unto't: where is my son, I pray you?
2133	
2134	Second Gentleman	Madam, he's gone to serve the duke of Florence:
2135	We met him thitherward; for thence we came,
2136	And, after some dispatch in hand at court,
2137	Thither we bend again.
2138	
2139	HELENA	Look on his letter, madam; here's my passport.
2140	
2141	[Reads]
2142	
2143	When thou canst get the ring upon my finger which
2144	never shall come off, and show me a child begotten
2145	of thy body that I am father to, then call me
2146	husband: but in such a 'then' I write a 'never.'
2147	This is a dreadful sentence.
2148	
2149	COUNTESS	Brought you this letter, gentlemen?
2150	
2151	First Gentleman	Ay, madam;
2152	And for the contents' sake are sorry for our pain.
2153	
2154	COUNTESS	I prithee, lady, have a better cheer;
2155	If thou engrossest all the griefs are thine,
2156	Thou robb'st me of a moiety: he was my son;
2157	But I do wash his name out of my blood,
2158	And thou art all my child. Towards Florence is he?
2159	
2160	Second Gentleman	Ay, madam.
2161	
2162	COUNTESS	         And to be a soldier?
2163	
2164	Second Gentleman	Such is his noble purpose; and believe 't,
2165	The duke will lay upon him all the honour
2166	That good convenience claims.
2167	
2168	COUNTESS	Return you thither?
2169	
2170	First Gentleman	Ay, madam, with the swiftest wing of speed.
2171	
2172	HELENA	[Reads]  Till I have no wife I have nothing in France.
2173	'Tis bitter.
2174	
2175	COUNTESS	                  Find you that there?
2176	
2177	HELENA	Ay, madam.
2178	
2179	First Gentleman	'Tis but the boldness of his hand, haply, which his
2180	heart was not consenting to.
2181	
2182	COUNTESS	Nothing in France, until he have no wife!
2183	There's nothing here that is too good for him
2184	But only she; and she deserves a lord
2185	That twenty such rude boys might tend upon
2186	And call her hourly mistress. Who was with him?
2187	
2188	First Gentleman	A servant only, and a gentleman
2189	Which I have sometime known.
2190	
2191	COUNTESS	Parolles, was it not?
2192	
2193	First Gentleman	Ay, my good lady, he.
2194	
2195	COUNTESS	A very tainted fellow, and full of wickedness.
2196	My son corrupts a well-derived nature
2197	With his inducement.
2198	
2199	First Gentleman	Indeed, good lady,
2200	The fellow has a deal of that too much,
2201	Which holds him much to have.
2202	
2203	COUNTESS	You're welcome, gentlemen.
2204	I will entreat you, when you see my son,
2205	To tell him that his sword can never win
2206	The honour that he loses: more I'll entreat you
2207	Written to bear along.
2208	
2209	Second Gentleman	We serve you, madam,
2210	In that and all your worthiest affairs.
2211	
2212	COUNTESS	Not so, but as we change our courtesies.
2213	Will you draw near!
2214	
2215	[Exeunt COUNTESS and Gentlemen]
2216	
2217	HELENA	'Till I have no wife, I have nothing in France.'
2218	Nothing in France, until he has no wife!
2219	Thou shalt have none, Rousillon, none in France;
2220	Then hast thou all again. Poor lord! is't I
2221	That chase thee from thy country and expose
2222	Those tender limbs of thine to the event
2223	Of the none-sparing war? and is it I
2224	That drive thee from the sportive court, where thou
2225	Wast shot at with fair eyes, to be the mark
2226	Of smoky muskets? O you leaden messengers,
2227	That ride upon the violent speed of fire,
2228	Fly with false aim; move the still-peering air,
2229	That sings with piercing; do not touch my lord.
2230	Whoever shoots at him, I set him there;
2231	Whoever charges on his forward breast,
2232	I am the caitiff that do hold him to't;
2233	And, though I kill him not, I am the cause
2234	His death was so effected: better 'twere
2235	I met the ravin lion when he roar'd
2236	With sharp constraint of hunger; better 'twere
2237	That all the miseries which nature owes
2238	Were mine at once. No, come thou home, Rousillon,
2239	Whence honour but of danger wins a scar,
2240	As oft it loses all: I will be gone;
2241	My being here it is that holds thee hence:
2242	Shall I stay here to do't?  no, no, although
2243	The air of paradise did fan the house
2244	And angels officed all: I will be gone,
2245	That pitiful rumour may report my flight,
2246	To consolate thine ear. Come, night; end, day!
2247	For with the dark, poor thief, I'll steal away.
2248

2265	PAROLLES, Soldiers, Drum, and Trumpets]
2266	
2267	DUKE	The general of our horse thou art; and we,
2268	Great in our hope, lay our best love and credence
2269	Upon thy promising fortune.
2270	
2271	BERTRAM	Sir, it is
2272	A charge too heavy for my strength, but yet
2273	We'll strive to bear it for your worthy sake
2274	To the extreme edge of hazard.
2275	
2276	DUKE	Then go thou forth;
2277	And fortune play upon thy prosperous helm,
2278	As thy auspicious mistress!
2279	
2280	BERTRAM	This very day,
2281	Great Mars, I put myself into thy file:
2282	Make me but like my thoughts, and I shall prove
2283	A lover of thy drum, hater of love.

2299	
2300	[Enter COUNTESS and Steward]
2301	
2302	COUNTESS	Alas! and would you take the letter of her?
2303	Might you not know she would do as she has done,
2304	By sending me a letter? Read it again.
2305	
2306	Steward	[Reads]
2307	
2308	I am Saint Jaques' pilgrim, thither gone:
2309	Ambitious love hath so in me offended,
2310	That barefoot plod I the cold ground upon,
2311	With sainted vow my faults to have amended.
2312	Write, write, that from the bloody course of war
2313	My dearest master, your dear son, may hie:
2314	Bless him at home in peace, whilst I from far
2315	His name with zealous fervor sanctify:
2316	His taken labours bid him me forgive;
2317	I, his despiteful Juno, sent him forth
2318	From courtly friends, with camping foes to live,
2319	Where death and danger dogs the heels of worth:
2320	He is too good and fair for death and me:
2321	Whom I myself embrace, to set him free.
2322	
2323	COUNTESS	Ah, what sharp stings are in her mildest words!
2324	Rinaldo, you did never lack advice so much,
2325	As letting her pass so: had I spoke with her,
2326	I could have well diverted her intents,
2327	Which thus she hath prevented.
2328	
2329	Steward	Pardon me, madam:
2330	If I had given you this at over-night,
2331	She might have been o'erta'en; and yet she writes,
2332	Pursuit would be but vain.
2333	
2334	COUNTESS	What angel shall
2335	Bless this unworthy husband? he cannot thrive,
2336	Unless her prayers, whom heaven delights to hear
2337	And loves to grant, reprieve him from the wrath
2338	Of greatest justice. Write, write, Rinaldo,
2339	To this unworthy husband of his wife;
2340	Let every word weigh heavy of her worth
2341	That he does weigh too light: my greatest grief.
2342	Though little he do feel it, set down sharply.
2343	Dispatch the most convenient messenger:
2344	When haply he shall hear that she is gone,
2345	He will return; and hope I may that she,
2346	Hearing so much, will speed her foot again,
2347	Led hither by pure love: which of them both
2348	Is dearest to me. I have no skill in sense
2349	To make distinction: provide this messenger:
2350	My heart is heavy and mine age is weak;
2351	Grief would have tears, and sorrow bids me speak.

2363	
2364	
2365	SCENE V	Florence. Without the walls. A tucket afar off.
2366	
2367	
2368	[Enter an old Widow of Florence, DIANA, VIOLENTA,
2369	and MARIANA, with other Citizens]
2370	
2371	Widow	Nay, come; for if they do approach the city, we
2372	shall lose all the sight.
2373	
2374	DIANA	They say the French count has done most honourable service.
2375	
2376	Widow	It is reported that he has taken their greatest
2377	commander; and that with his own hand he slew the
2378	duke's brother.
2379	
2380	[Tucket]
2381	
2382	We have lost our labour; they are gone a contrary
2383	way: hark! you may know by their trumpets.
2384	
2385	MARIANA	Come, let's return again, and suffice ourselves with
2386	the report of it. Well, Diana, take heed of this
2387	French earl: the honour of a maid is her name; and
2388	no legacy is so rich as honesty.
2389	
2390	Widow	I have told my neighbour how you have been solicited
2391	by a gentleman his companion.
2392	
2393	MARIANA	I know that knave; hang him! one Parolles: a
2394	filthy officer he is in those suggestions for the
2395	young earl. Beware of them, Diana; their promises,
2396	enticements, oaths, tokens, and all these engines of
2397	lust, are not the things they go under: many a maid
2398	hath been seduced by them; and the misery is,
2399	example, that so terrible shows in the wreck of
2400	maidenhood, cannot for all that dissuade succession,
2401	but that they are limed with the twigs that threaten
2402	them. I hope I need not to advise you further; but
2403	I hope your own grace will keep you where you are,
2404	though there were no further danger known but the
2405	modesty which is so lost.
2406	
2407	DIANA	You shall not need to fear me.
2408	
2409	Widow	I hope so.
2410	
2411	[Enter HELENA, disguised like a Pilgrim]
2412	
2413	Look, here comes a pilgrim: I know she will lie at
2414	my house; thither they send one another: I'll
2415	question her. God save you, pilgrim! whither are you bound?
2416	
2417	HELENA	To Saint Jaques le Grand.
2418	Where do the palmers lodge, I do beseech you?
2419	
2420	Widow	At the Saint Francis here beside the port.
2421	
2422	HELENA	Is this the way?
2423	
2424	Widow	Ay, marry, is't.
2425	
2426	[A march afar]
2427	
2428	Hark you! they come this way.
2429	If you will tarry, holy pilgrim,
2430	But till the troops come by,
2431	I will conduct you where you shall be lodged;
2432	The rather, for I think I know your hostess
2433	As ample as myself.
2434	
2435	HELENA	Is it yourself?
2436	
2437	Widow	If you shall please so, pilgrim.
2438	
2439	HELENA	I thank you, and will stay upon your leisure.
2440	
2441	Widow	You came, I think, from France?
2442	
2443	HELENA	I did so.
2444	
2445	Widow	Here you shall see a countryman of yours
2446	That has done worthy service.
2447	
2448	HELENA	His name, I pray you.
2449	
2450	DIANA	The Count Rousillon: know you such a one?
2451	
2452	HELENA	But by the ear, that hears most nobly of him:
2453	His face I know not.
2454	
2455	DIANA	Whatsome'er he is,
2456	He's bravely taken here. He stole from France,
2457	As 'tis reported, for the king had married him
2458	Against his liking: think you it is so?
2459	
2460	HELENA	Ay, surely, mere the truth: I know his lady.
2461	
2462	DIANA	There is a gentleman that serves the count
2463	Reports but coarsely of her.
2464	
2465	HELENA	What's his name?
2466	
2467	DIANA	Monsieur Parolles.
2468	
2469	HELENA	                  O, I believe with him,
2470	In argument of praise, or to the worth
2471	Of the great count himself, she is too mean
2472	To have her name repeated: all her deserving
2473	Is a reserved honesty, and that
2474	I have not heard examined.
2475	
2476	DIANA	Alas, poor lady!
2477	'Tis a hard bondage to become the wife
2478	Of a detesting lord.
2479	
2480	Widow	I warrant, good creature, wheresoe'er she is,
2481	Her heart weighs sadly: this young maid might do her
2482	A shrewd turn, if she pleased.
2483	
2484	HELENA	How do you mean?
2485	May be the amorous count solicits her
2486	In the unlawful purpose.
2487	
2488	Widow	He does indeed;
2489	And brokes with all that can in such a suit
2490	Corrupt the tender honour of a maid:
2491	But she is arm'd for him and keeps her guard
2492	In honestest defence.
2493	
2494	MARIANA	The gods forbid else!
2495	
2496	Widow	So, now they come:
2497	
2498	[Drum and Colours]
2499	
2500	[Enter BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and the whole army]
2501	
2502	That is Antonio, the duke's eldest son;
2503	That, Escalus.
2504	
2505	HELENA	                  Which is the Frenchman?
2506	
2507	DIANA	He;
2508	That with the plume: 'tis a most gallant fellow.
2509	I would he loved his wife: if he were honester
2510	He were much goodlier: is't not a handsome gentleman?
2511	
2512	HELENA	I like him well.
2513	
2514	DIANA	'Tis pity he is not honest: yond's that same knave
2515	That leads him to these places: were I his lady,
2516	I would Poison that vile rascal.
2517	
2518	HELENA	Which is he?
2519	
2520	DIANA	That jack-an-apes with scarfs: why is he melancholy?
2521	
2522	HELENA	Perchance he's hurt i' the battle.
2523	
2524	PAROLLES	Lose our drum! well.
2525	
2526	MARIANA	He's shrewdly vexed at something: look, he has spied us.
2527	
2528	Widow	Marry, hang you!
2529	
2530	MARIANA	And your courtesy, for a ring-carrier!
2531	
2532	[Exeunt BERTRAM, PAROLLES, and army]
2533	
2534	Widow	The troop is past. Come, pilgrim, I will bring you
2535	Where you shall host: of enjoin'd penitents
2536	There's four or five, to great Saint Jaques bound,
2537	Already at my house.
2538	
2539	HELENA	I humbly thank you:
2540	Please it this matron and this gentle maid
2541	To eat with us to-night, the charge and thanking
2542	Shall be for me; and, to requite you further,
2543	I will bestow some precepts of this virgin
2544	Worthy the note.
2545	
2546	BOTH	                  We'll take your offer kindly.

2559	
2560	SCENE VI	Camp before Florence.
2561	
2562	
2563	[Enter BERTRAM and the two French Lords]
2564	
2565	Second Lord	Nay, good my lord, put him to't; let him have his
2566	way.
2567	
2568	First Lord	If your lordship find him not a hilding, hold me no
2569	more in your respect.
2570	
2571	Second Lord	On my life, my lord, a bubble.
2572	
2573	BERTRAM	Do you think I am so far deceived in him?
2574	
2575	Second Lord	Believe it, my lord, in mine own direct knowledge,
2576	without any malice, but to speak of him as my
2577	kinsman, he's a most notable coward, an infinite and
2578	endless liar, an hourly promise-breaker, the owner
2579	of no one good quality worthy your lordship's
2580	entertainment.
2581	
2582	First Lord	It were fit you knew him; lest, reposing too far in
2583	his virtue, which he hath not, he might at some
2584	great and trusty business in a main danger fail you.
2585	
2586	BERTRAM	I would I knew in what particular action to try him.
2587	
2588	First Lord	None better than to let him fetch off his drum,
2589	which you hear him so confidently undertake to do.
2590	
2591	Second Lord	I, with a troop of Florentines, will suddenly
2592	surprise him; such I will have, whom I am sure he
2593	knows not from the enemy: we will bind and hoodwink
2594	him so, that he shall suppose no other but that he
2595	is carried into the leaguer of the adversaries, when
2596	we bring him to our own tents. Be but your lordship
2597	present at his examination: if he do not, for the
2598	promise of his life and in the highest compulsion of
2599	base fear, offer to betray you and deliver all the
2600	intelligence in his power against you, and that with
2601	the divine forfeit of his soul upon oath, never
2602	trust my judgment in any thing.
2603	
2604	First Lord	O, for the love of laughter, let him fetch his drum;
2605	he says he has a stratagem for't: when your
2606	lordship sees the bottom of his success in't, and to
2607	what metal this counterfeit lump of ore will be
2608	melted, if you give him not John Drum's
2609	entertainment, your inclining cannot be removed.
2610	Here he comes.
2611	
2612	[Enter PAROLLES]
2613	
2614	Second Lord	[Aside to BERTRAM]  O, for the love of laughter,
2615	hinder not the honour of his design: let him fetch
2616	off his drum in any hand.
2617	
2618	BERTRAM	How now, monsieur! this drum sticks sorely in your
2619	disposition.
2620	
2621	First Lord	A pox on't, let it go; 'tis but a drum.
2622	
2623	PAROLLES	'But a drum'! is't 'but a drum'? A drum so lost!
2624	There was excellent command,--to charge in with our
2625	horse upon our own wings, and to rend our own soldiers!
2626	
2627	First Lord	That was not to be blamed in the command of the
2628	service: it was a disaster of war that Caesar
2629	himself could not have prevented, if he had been
2630	there to command.
2631	
2632	BERTRAM	Well, we cannot greatly condemn our success: some
2633	dishonour we had in the loss of that drum; but it is
2634	not to be recovered.
2635	
2636	PAROLLES	It might have been recovered.
2637	
2638	BERTRAM	It might; but it is not now.
2639	
2640	PAROLLES	It is to be recovered: but that the merit of
2641	service is seldom attributed to the true and exact
2642	performer, I would have that drum or another, or
2643	'hic jacet.'
2644	
2645	BERTRAM	Why, if you have a stomach, to't, monsieur: if you
2646	think your mystery in stratagem can bring this
2647	instrument of honour again into his native quarter,
2648	be magnanimous in the enterprise and go on; I will
2649	grace the attempt for a worthy exploit: if you
2650	speed well in it, the duke shall both speak of it.
2651	and extend to you what further becomes his
2652	greatness, even to the utmost syllable of your
2653	worthiness.
2654	
2655	PAROLLES	By the hand of a soldier, I will undertake it.
2656	
2657	BERTRAM	But you must not now slumber in it.
2658	
2659	PAROLLES	I'll about it this evening: and I will presently
2660	pen down my dilemmas, encourage myself in my
2661	certainty, put myself into my mortal preparation;
2662	and by midnight look to hear further from me.
2663	
2664	BERTRAM	May I be bold to acquaint his grace you are gone about it?
2665	
2666	PAROLLES	I know not what the success will be, my lord; but
2667	the attempt I vow.
2668	
2669	BERTRAM	I know thou'rt valiant; and, to the possibility of
2670	thy soldiership, will subscribe for thee. Farewell.
2671	
2672	PAROLLES	I love not many words.
2673	
2674	[Exit]
2675	
2676	Second Lord	No more than a fish loves water. Is not this a
2677	strange fellow, my lord, that so confidently seems
2678	to undertake this business, which he knows is not to
2679	be done; damns himself to do and dares better be
2680	damned than to do't?
2681	
2682	First Lord	You do not know him, my lord, as we do: certain it
2683	is that he will steal himself into a man's favour and
2684	for a week escape a great deal of discoveries; but
2685	when you find him out, you have him ever after.
2686	
2687	BERTRAM	Why, do you think he will make no deed at all of
2688	this that so seriously he does address himself unto?
2689	
2690	Second Lord	None in the world; but return with an invention and
2691	clap upon you two or three probable lies: but we
2692	have almost embossed him; you shall see his fall
2693	to-night; for indeed he is not for your lordship's respect.
2694	
2695	First Lord	We'll make you some sport with the fox ere we case
2696	him. He was first smoked by the old lord Lafeu:
2697	when his disguise and he is parted, tell me what a
2698	sprat you shall find him; which you shall see this
2699	very night.
2700	
2701	Second Lord	I must go look my twigs: he shall be caught.
2702	
2703	BERTRAM	Your brother he shall go along with me.
2704	
2705	Second Lord	As't please your lordship: I'll leave you.
2706	
2707	[Exit]
2708	
2709	BERTRAM	Now will I lead you to the house, and show you
2710	The lass I spoke of.
2711	
2712	First Lord	But you say she's honest.
2713	
2714	BERTRAM	That's all the fault: I spoke with her but once
2715	And found her wondrous cold; but I sent to her,
2716	By this same coxcomb that we have i' the wind,
2717	Tokens and letters which she did re-send;
2718	And this is all I have done. She's a fair creature:
2719	Will you go see her?
2720	
2721	First Lord	With all my heart, my lord.
2722	
2723	[Exeunt]
2724

2728	ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
2729	
2730	
2731	ACT III
2732	
2733	
2734	
2735	SCENE VII	Florence. The Widow's house.
2736	
2737	
2738	[Enter HELENA and Widow]
2739	
2740	HELENA	If you misdoubt me that I am not she,
2741	I know not how I shall assure you further,
2742	But I shall lose the grounds I work upon.
2743	
2744	Widow	Though my estate be fallen, I was well born,
2745	Nothing acquainted with these businesses;
2746	And would not put my reputation now
2747	In any staining act.
2748	
2749	HELENA	Nor would I wish you.
2750	First, give me trust, the count he is my husband,
2751	And what to your sworn counsel I have spoken
2752	Is so from word to word; and then you cannot,
2753	By the good aid that I of you shall borrow,
2754	Err in bestowing it.
2755	
2756	Widow	I should believe you:
2757	For you have show'd me that which well approves
2758	You're great in fortune.
2759	
2760	HELENA	Take this purse of gold,
2761	And let me buy your friendly help thus far,
2762	Which I will over-pay and pay again
2763	When I have found it. The count he wooes your daughter,
2764	Lays down his wanton siege before her beauty,
2765	Resolved to carry her: let her in fine consent,
2766	As we'll direct her how 'tis best to bear it.
2767	Now his important blood will nought deny
2768	That she'll demand: a ring the county wears,
2769	That downward hath succeeded in his house
2770	From son to son, some four or five descents
2771	Since the first father wore it: this ring he holds
2772	In most rich choice; yet in his idle fire,
2773	To buy his will, it would not seem too dear,
2774	Howe'er repented after.
2775	
2776	Widow	Now I see
2777	The bottom of your purpose.
2778	
2779	HELENA	You see it lawful, then: it is no more,
2780	But that your daughter, ere she seems as won,
2781	Desires this ring; appoints him an encounter;
2782	In fine, delivers me to fill the time,
2783	Herself most chastely absent: after this,
2784	To marry her, I'll add three thousand crowns
2785	To what is passed already.
2786	
2787	Widow	I have yielded:
2788	Instruct my daughter how she shall persever,
2789	That time and place with this deceit so lawful
2790	May prove coherent. Every night he comes
2791	With musics of all sorts and songs composed
2792	To her unworthiness: it nothing steads us
2793	To chide him from our eaves; for he persists
2794	As if his life lay on't.
2795	
2796	HELENA	Why then to-night
2797	Let us assay our plot; which, if it speed,
2798	Is wicked meaning in a lawful deed
2799	And lawful meaning in a lawful act,
2800	Where both not sin, and yet a sinful fact:
2801	But let's about it.
2802	
2803	[Exeunt]
2804

2811	ACT IV
2812	
2813	
2814	
2815	SCENE I	Without the Florentine camp.
2816	
2817	
2818	[Enter Second French Lord, with five or six other
2819	Soldiers in ambush]
2820	
2821	Second Lord	He can come no other way but by this hedge-corner.
2822	When you sally upon him, speak what terrible
2823	language you will: though you understand it not
2824	yourselves, no matter; for we must not seem to
2825	understand him, unless some one among us whom we
2826	must produce for an interpreter.
2827	
2828	First Soldier	Good captain, let me be the interpreter.
2829	
2830	Second Lord	Art not acquainted with him? knows he not thy voice?
2831	
2832	First Soldier	No, sir, I warrant you.
2833	
2834	Second Lord	But what linsey-woolsey hast thou to speak to us again?
2835	
2836	First Soldier	E'en such as you speak to me.
2837	
2838	Second Lord	He must think us some band of strangers i' the
2839	adversary's entertainment. Now he hath a smack of
2840	all neighbouring languages; therefore we must every
2841	one be a man of his own fancy, not to know what we
2842	speak one to another; so we seem to know, is to
2843	know straight our purpose: choughs' language,
2844	gabble enough, and good enough. As for you,
2845	interpreter, you must seem very politic. But couch,
2846	ho! here he comes, to beguile two hours in a sleep,
2847	and then to return and swear the lies he forges.
2848	
2849	[Enter PAROLLES]
2850	
2851	PAROLLES	Ten o'clock: within these three hours 'twill be
2852	time enough to go home. What shall I say I have
2853	done? It must be a very plausive invention that
2854	carries it: they begin to smoke me; and disgraces
2855	have of late knocked too often at my door. I find
2856	my tongue is too foolhardy; but my heart hath the
2857	fear of Mars before it and of his creatures, not
2858	daring the reports of my tongue.
2859	
2860	Second Lord	This is the first truth that e'er thine own tongue
2861	was guilty of.
2862	
2863	PAROLLES	What the devil should move me to undertake the
2864	recovery of this drum, being not ignorant of the
2865	impossibility, and knowing I had no such purpose? I
2866	must give myself some hurts, and say I got them in
2867	exploit: yet slight ones will not carry it; they
2868	will say, 'Came you off with so little?' and great
2869	ones I dare not give. Wherefore, what's the
2870	instance? Tongue, I must put you into a
2871	butter-woman's mouth and buy myself another of
2872	Bajazet's mule, if you prattle me into these perils.
2873	
2874	Second Lord	Is it possible he should know what he is, and be
2875	that he is?
2876	
2877	PAROLLES	I would the cutting of my garments would serve the
2878	turn, or the breaking of my Spanish sword.
2879	
2880	Second Lord	We cannot afford you so.
2881	
2882	PAROLLES	Or the baring of my beard; and to say it was in
2883	stratagem.
2884	
2885	Second Lord	'Twould not do.
2886	
2887	PAROLLES	Or to drown my clothes, and say I was stripped.
2888	
2889	Second Lord	Hardly serve.
2890	
2891	PAROLLES	Though I swore I leaped from the window of the citadel.
2892	
2893	Second Lord	How deep?
2894	
2895	PAROLLES	Thirty fathom.
2896	
2897	Second Lord	Three great oaths would scarce make that be believed.
2898	
2899	PAROLLES	I would I had any drum of the enemy's: I would swear
2900	I recovered it.
2901	
2902	Second Lord	You shall hear one anon.
2903	
2904	PAROLLES	A drum now of the enemy's,--
2905	
2906	[Alarum within]
2907	
2908	Second Lord	Throca movousus, cargo, cargo, cargo.
2909	
2910	All	Cargo, cargo, cargo, villiando par corbo, cargo.
2911	
2912	PAROLLES	O, ransom, ransom! do not hide mine eyes.
2913	
2914	[They seize and blindfold him]
2915	
2916	First Soldier	Boskos thromuldo boskos.
2917	
2918	PAROLLES	I know you are the Muskos' regiment:
2919	And I shall lose my life for want of language;
2920	If there be here German, or Dane, low Dutch,
2921	Italian, or French, let him speak to me; I'll
2922	Discover that which shall undo the Florentine.
2923	
2924	First Soldier	Boskos vauvado: I understand thee, and can speak
2925	thy tongue. Kerely bonto, sir, betake thee to thy
2926	faith, for seventeen poniards are at thy bosom.
2927	
2928	PAROLLES	O!
2929	
2930	First Soldier	O, pray, pray, pray! Manka revania dulche.
2931	
2932	Second Lord	Oscorbidulchos volivorco.
2933	
2934	First Soldier	The general is content to spare thee yet;
2935	And, hoodwink'd as thou art, will lead thee on
2936	To gather from thee: haply thou mayst inform
2937	Something to save thy life.
2938	
2939	PAROLLES	O, let me live!
2940	And all the secrets of our camp I'll show,
2941	Their force, their purposes; nay, I'll speak that
2942	Which you will wonder at.
2943	
2944	First Soldier	But wilt thou faithfully?
2945	
2946	PAROLLES	If I do not, damn me.
2947	
2948	First Soldier	Acordo linta.
2949	Come on; thou art granted space.
2950	
2951	[Exit, with PAROLLES guarded. A short alarum within]
2952	
2953	Second Lord	Go, tell the Count Rousillon, and my brother,
2954	We have caught the woodcock, and will keep him muffled
2955	Till we do hear from them.
2956	
2957	Second Soldier	Captain, I will.
2958	
2959	Second Lord	A' will betray us all unto ourselves:
2960	Inform on that.
2961	
2962	Second Soldier	                  So I will, sir.
2963	
2964	Second Lord	Till then I'll keep him dark and safely lock'd.
2965

2975	
2976	
2977	
2978	SCENE II	Florence. The Widow's house.
2979	
2980	
2981	[Enter BERTRAM and DIANA]
2982	
2983	BERTRAM	They told me that your name was Fontibell.
2984	
2985	DIANA	No, my good lord, Diana.
2986	
2987	BERTRAM	Titled goddess;
2988	And worth it, with addition! But, fair soul,
2989	In your fine frame hath love no quality?
2990	If quick fire of youth light not your mind,
2991	You are no maiden, but a monument:
2992	When you are dead, you should be such a one
2993	As you are now, for you are cold and stem;
2994	And now you should be as your mother was
2995	When your sweet self was got.
2996	
2997	DIANA	She then was honest.
2998	
2999	BERTRAM	So should you be.
3000	
3001	DIANA	No:
3002	My mother did but duty; such, my lord,
3003	As you owe to your wife.
3004	
3005	BERTRAM	No more o' that;
3006	I prithee, do not strive against my vows:
3007	I was compell'd to her; but I love thee
3008	By love's own sweet constraint, and will for ever
3009	Do thee all rights of service.
3010	
3011	DIANA	Ay, so you serve us
3012	Till we serve you; but when you have our roses,
3013	You barely leave our thorns to prick ourselves
3014	And mock us with our bareness.
3015	
3016	BERTRAM	How have I sworn!
3017	
3018	DIANA	'Tis not the many oaths that makes the truth,
3019	But the plain single vow that is vow'd true.
3020	What is not holy, that we swear not by,
3021	But take the High'st to witness: then, pray you, tell me,
3022	If I should swear by God's great attributes,
3023	I loved you dearly, would you believe my oaths,
3024	When I did love you ill? This has no holding,
3025	To swear by him whom I protest to love,
3026	That I will work against him: therefore your oaths
3027	Are words and poor conditions, but unseal'd,
3028	At least in my opinion.
3029	
3030	BERTRAM	Change it, change it;
3031	Be not so holy-cruel: love is holy;
3032	And my integrity ne'er knew the crafts
3033	That you do charge men with. Stand no more off,
3034	But give thyself unto my sick desires,
3035	Who then recover: say thou art mine, and ever
3036	My love as it begins shall so persever.
3037	
3038	DIANA	I see that men make ropes in such a scarre
3039	That we'll forsake ourselves. Give me that ring.
3040	
3041	BERTRAM	I'll lend it thee, my dear; but have no power
3042	To give it from me.
3043	
3044	DIANA	Will you not, my lord?
3045	
3046	BERTRAM	It is an honour 'longing to our house,
3047	Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
3048	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
3049	In me to lose.
3050	
3051	DIANA	                  Mine honour's such a ring:
3052	My chastity's the jewel of our house,
3053	Bequeathed down from many ancestors;
3054	Which were the greatest obloquy i' the world
3055	In me to lose: thus your own proper wisdom
3056	Brings in the champion Honour on my part,
3057	Against your vain assault.
3058	
3059	BERTRAM	Here, take my ring:
3060	My house, mine honour, yea, my life, be thine,
3061	And I'll be bid by thee.
3062	
3063	DIANA	When midnight comes, knock at my chamber-window:
3064	I'll order take my mother shall not hear.
3065	Now will I charge you in the band of truth,
3066	When you have conquer'd my yet maiden bed,
3067	Remain there but an hour, nor speak to me:
3068	My reasons are most strong; and you shall know them
3069	When back again this ring shall be deliver'd:
3070	And on your finger in the night I'll put
3071	Another ring, that what in time proceeds
3072	May token to the future our past deeds.
3073	Adieu, till then; then, fail not. You have won
3074	A wife of me, though there my hope be done.
3075	
3076	BERTRAM	A heaven on earth I have won by wooing thee.
3077	
3078	[Exit]
3079	
3080	DIANA	For which live long to thank both heaven and me!
3081	You may so in the end.
3082	My mother told me just how he would woo,
3083	As if she sat in 's heart; she says all men
3084	Have the like oaths: he had sworn to marry me
3085	When his wife's dead; therefore I'll lie with him
3086	When I am buried. Since Frenchmen are so braid,
3087	Marry that will, I live and die a maid:
3088	Only in this disguise I think't no sin
3089	To cozen him that would unjustly win.
3090	
3091	[Exit]

3100	
3101	
3102	
3103	SCENE III	The Florentine camp.
3104	
3105	
3106	[Enter the two French Lords and some two or three Soldiers]
3107	
3108	First Lord	You have not given him his mother's letter?
3109	
3110	Second Lord	I have delivered it an hour since: there is
3111	something in't that stings his nature; for on the
3112	reading it he changed almost into another man.
3113	
3114	First Lord	He has much worthy blame laid upon him for shaking
3115	off so good a wife and so sweet a lady.
3116	
3117	Second Lord	Especially he hath incurred the everlasting
3118	displeasure of the king, who had even tuned his
3119	bounty to sing happiness to him. I will tell you a
3120	thing, but you shall let it dwell darkly with you.
3121	
3122	First Lord	When you have spoken it, 'tis dead, and I am the
3123	grave of it.
3124	
3125	Second Lord	He hath perverted a young gentlewoman here in
3126	Florence, of a most chaste renown; and this night he
3127	fleshes his will in the spoil of her honour: he hath
3128	given her his monumental ring, and thinks himself
3129	made in the unchaste composition.
3130	
3131	First Lord	Now, God delay our rebellion! as we are ourselves,
3132	what things are we!
3133	
3134	Second Lord	Merely our own traitors. And as in the common course
3135	of all treasons, we still see them reveal
3136	themselves, till they attain to their abhorred ends,
3137	so he that in this action contrives against his own
3138	nobility, in his proper stream o'erflows himself.
3139	
3140	First Lord	Is it not meant damnable in us, to be trumpeters of
3141	our unlawful intents? We shall not then have his
3142	company to-night?
3143	
3144	Second Lord	Not till after midnight; for he is dieted to his hour.
3145	
3146	First Lord	That approaches apace; I would gladly have him see
3147	his company anatomized, that he might take a measure
3148	of his own judgments, wherein so curiously he had
3149	set this counterfeit.
3150	
3151	Second Lord	We will not meddle with him till he come; for his
3152	presence must be the whip of the other.
3153	
3154	First Lord	In the mean time, what hear you of these wars?
3155	
3156	Second Lord	I hear there is an overture of peace.
3157	
3158	First Lord	Nay, I assure you, a peace concluded.
3159	
3160	Second Lord	What will Count Rousillon do then? will he travel
3161	higher, or return again into France?
3162	
3163	First Lord	I perceive, by this demand, you are not altogether
3164	of his council.
3165	
3166	Second Lord	Let it be forbid, sir; so should I be a great deal
3167	of his act.
3168	
3169	First Lord	Sir, his wife some two months since fled from his
3170	house: her pretence is a pilgrimage to Saint Jaques
3171	le Grand; which holy undertaking with most austere
3172	sanctimony she accomplished; and, there residing the
3173	tenderness of her nature became as a prey to her
3174	grief; in fine, made a groan of her last breath, and
3175	now she sings in heaven.
3176	
3177	Second Lord	How is this justified?
3178	
3179	First Lord	The stronger part of it by her own letters, which
3180	makes her story true, even to the point of her
3181	death: her death itself, which could not be her
3182	office to say is come, was faithfully confirmed by
3183	the rector of the place.
3184	
3185	Second Lord	Hath the count all this intelligence?
3186	
3187	First Lord	Ay, and the particular confirmations, point from
3188	point, so to the full arming of the verity.
3189	
3190	Second Lord	I am heartily sorry that he'll be glad of this.
3191	
3192	First Lord	How mightily sometimes we make us comforts of our losses!
3193	
3194	Second Lord	And how mightily some other times we drown our gain
3195	in tears! The great dignity that his valour hath
3196	here acquired for him shall at home be encountered
3197	with a shame as ample.
3198	
3199	First Lord	The web of our life is of a mingled yarn, good and
3200	ill together: our virtues would be proud, if our
3201	faults whipped them not; and our crimes would
3202	despair, if they were not cherished by our virtues.
3203	
3204	[Enter a Messenger]
3205	
3206	How now! where's your master?
3207	
3208	Servant	He met the duke in the street, sir, of whom he hath
3209	taken a solemn leave: his lordship will next
3210	morning for France. The duke hath offered him
3211	letters of commendations to the king.
3212	
3213	Second Lord	They shall be no more than needful there, if they
3214	were more than they can commend.
3215	
3216	First Lord	They cannot be too sweet for the king's tartness.
3217	Here's his lordship now.
3218	
3219	[Enter BERTRAM]
3220	
3221	How now, my lord! is't not after midnight?
3222	
3223	BERTRAM	I have to-night dispatched sixteen businesses, a
3224	month's length a-piece, by an abstract of success:
3225	I have congied with the duke, done my adieu with his
3226	nearest; buried a wife, mourned for her; writ to my
3227	lady mother I am returning; entertained my convoy;
3228	and between these main parcels of dispatch effected
3229	many nicer needs; the last was the greatest, but
3230	that I have not ended yet.
3231	
3232	Second Lord	If the business be of any difficulty, and this
3233	morning your departure hence, it requires haste of
3234	your lordship.
3235	
3236	BERTRAM	I mean, the business is not ended, as fearing to
3237	hear of it hereafter. But shall we have this
3238	dialogue between the fool and the soldier? Come,
3239	bring forth this counterfeit module, he has deceived
3240	me, like a double-meaning prophesier.
3241	
3242	Second Lord	Bring him forth: has sat i' the stocks all night,
3243	poor gallant knave.
3244	
3245	BERTRAM	No matter: his heels have deserved it, in usurping
3246	his spurs so long. How does he carry himself?
3247	
3248	Second Lord	I have told your lordship already, the stocks carry
3249	him. But to answer you as you would be understood;
3250	he weeps like a wench that had shed her milk: he
3251	hath confessed himself to Morgan, whom he supposes
3252	to be a friar, from the time of his remembrance to
3253	this very instant disaster of his setting i' the
3254	stocks: and what think you he hath confessed?
3255	
3256	BERTRAM	Nothing of me, has a'?
3257	
3258	Second Lord	His confession is taken, and it shall be read to his
3259	face: if your lordship be in't, as I believe you
3260	are, you must have the patience to hear it.
3261	
3262	[Enter PAROLLES guarded, and First Soldier]
3263	
3264	BERTRAM	A plague upon him! muffled! he can say nothing of
3265	me: hush, hush!
3266	
3267	First Lord	Hoodman comes! Portotartarosa
3268	
3269	First Soldier	He calls for the tortures: what will you say
3270	without 'em?
3271	
3272	PAROLLES	I will confess what I know without constraint: if
3273	ye pinch me like a pasty, I can say no more.
3274	
3275	First Soldier	Bosko chimurcho.
3276	
3277	First Lord	Boblibindo chicurmurco.
3278	
3279	First Soldier	You are a merciful general. Our general bids you
3280	answer to what I shall ask you out of a note.
3281	
3282	PAROLLES	And truly, as I hope to live.
3283	
3284	First Soldier	[Reads]  'First demand of him how many horse the
3285	duke is strong.' What say you to that?
3286	
3287	PAROLLES	Five or six thousand; but very weak and
3288	unserviceable: the troops are all scattered, and
3289	the commanders very poor rogues, upon my reputation
3290	and credit and as I hope to live.
3291	
3292	First Soldier	Shall I set down your answer so?
3293	
3294	PAROLLES	Do: I'll take the sacrament on't, how and which way you will.
3295	
3296	BERTRAM	All's one to him. What a past-saving slave is this!
3297	
3298	First Lord	You're deceived, my lord: this is Monsieur
3299	Parolles, the gallant militarist,--that was his own
3300	phrase,--that had the whole theoric of war in the
3301	knot of his scarf, and the practise in the chape of
3302	his dagger.
3303	
3304	Second Lord	I will never trust a man again for keeping his sword
3305	clean. nor believe he can have every thing in him
3306	by wearing his apparel neatly.
3307	
3308	First Soldier	Well, that's set down.
3309	
3310	PAROLLES	Five or six thousand horse, I said,-- I will say
3311	true,--or thereabouts, set down, for I'll speak truth.
3312	
3313	First Lord	He's very near the truth in this.
3314	
3315	BERTRAM	But I con him no thanks for't, in the nature he
3316	delivers it.
3317	
3318	PAROLLES	Poor rogues, I pray you, say.
3319	
3320	First Soldier	Well, that's set down.
3321	
3322	PAROLLES	I humbly thank you, sir: a truth's a truth, the
3323	rogues are marvellous poor.
3324	
3325	First Soldier	[Reads]  'Demand of him, of what strength they are
3326	a-foot.' What say you to that?
3327	
3328	PAROLLES	By my troth, sir, if I were to live this present
3329	hour, I will tell true. Let me see: Spurio, a
3330	hundred and fifty; Sebastian, so many; Corambus, so
3331	many; Jaques, so many; Guiltian, Cosmo, Lodowick,
3332	and Gratii, two hundred and fifty each; mine own
3333	company, Chitopher, Vaumond, Bentii, two hundred and
3334	fifty each: so that the muster-file, rotten and
3335	sound, upon my life, amounts not to fifteen thousand
3336	poll; half of the which dare not shake snow from off
3337	their cassocks, lest they shake themselves to pieces.
3338	
3339	BERTRAM	What shall be done to him?
3340	
3341	First Lord	Nothing, but let him have thanks. Demand of him my
3342	condition, and what credit I have with the duke.
3343	
3344	First Soldier	Well, that's set down.
3345	
3346	[Reads]
3347	
3348	'You shall demand of him, whether one Captain Dumain
3349	be i' the camp, a Frenchman; what his reputation is
3350	with the duke; what his valour, honesty, and
3351	expertness in wars; or whether he thinks it were not
3352	possible, with well-weighing sums of gold, to
3353	corrupt him to revolt.' What say you to this? what
3354	do you know of it?
3355	
3356	PAROLLES	I beseech you, let me answer to the particular of
3357	the inter'gatories: demand them singly.
3358	
3359	First Soldier	Do you know this Captain Dumain?
3360	
3361	PAROLLES	I know him: a' was a botcher's 'prentice in Paris,
3362	from whence he was whipped for getting the shrieve's
3363	fool with child,--a dumb innocent, that could not
3364	say him nay.
3365	
3366	BERTRAM	Nay, by your leave, hold your hands; though I know
3367	his brains are forfeit to the next tile that falls.
3368	
3369	First Soldier	Well, is this captain in the duke of Florence's camp?
3370	
3371	PAROLLES	Upon my knowledge, he is, and lousy.
3372	
3373	First Lord	Nay look not so upon me; we shall hear of your
3374	lordship anon.
3375	
3376	First Soldier	What is his reputation with the duke?
3377	
3378	PAROLLES	The duke knows him for no other but a poor officer
3379	of mine; and writ to me this other day to turn him
3380	out o' the band: I think I have his letter in my pocket.
3381	
3382	First Soldier	Marry, we'll search.
3383	
3384	PAROLLES	In good sadness, I do not know; either it is there,
3385	or it is upon a file with the duke's other letters
3386	in my tent.
3387	
3388	First Soldier	Here 'tis; here's a paper: shall I read it to you?
3389	
3390	PAROLLES	I do not know if it be it or no.
3391	
3392	BERTRAM	Our interpreter does it well.
3393	
3394	First Lord	Excellently.
3395	
3396	First Soldier	[Reads]  'Dian, the count's a fool, and full of gold,'--
3397	
3398	PAROLLES	That is not the duke's letter, sir; that is an
3399	advertisement to a proper maid in Florence, one
3400	Diana, to take heed of the allurement of one Count
3401	Rousillon, a foolish idle boy, but for all that very
3402	ruttish: I pray you, sir, put it up again.
3403	
3404	First Soldier	Nay, I'll read it first, by your favour.
3405	
3406	PAROLLES	My meaning in't, I protest, was very honest in the
3407	behalf of the maid; for I knew the young count to be
3408	a dangerous and lascivious boy, who is a whale to
3409	virginity and devours up all the fry it finds.
3410	
3411	BERTRAM	Damnable both-sides rogue!
3412	
3413	First Soldier	[Reads]  'When he swears oaths, bid him drop gold, and take it;
3414	After he scores, he never pays the score:
3415	Half won is match well made; match, and well make it;
3416	He ne'er pays after-debts, take it before;
3417	And say a soldier, Dian, told thee this,
3418	Men are to mell with, boys are not to kiss:
3419	For count of this, the count's a fool, I know it,
3420	Who pays before, but not when he does owe it.
3421	Thine, as he vowed to thee in thine ear,
3422	PAROLLES.'
3423	
3424	BERTRAM	He shall be whipped through the army with this rhyme
3425	in's forehead.
3426	
3427	Second Lord	This is your devoted friend, sir, the manifold
3428	linguist and the armipotent soldier.
3429	
3430	BERTRAM	I could endure any thing before but a cat, and now
3431	he's a cat to me.
3432	
3433	First Soldier	I perceive, sir, by the general's looks, we shall be
3434	fain to hang you.
3435	
3436	PAROLLES	My life, sir, in any case: not that I am afraid to
3437	die; but that, my offences being many, I would
3438	repent out the remainder of nature: let me live,
3439	sir, in a dungeon, i' the stocks, or any where, so I may live.
3440	
3441	First Soldier	We'll see what may be done, so you confess freely;
3442	therefore, once more to this Captain Dumain: you
3443	have answered to his reputation with the duke and to
3444	his valour: what is his honesty?
3445	
3446	PAROLLES	He will steal, sir, an egg out of a cloister: for
3447	rapes and ravishments he parallels Nessus: he
3448	professes not keeping of oaths; in breaking 'em he
3449	is stronger than Hercules: he will lie, sir, with
3450	such volubility, that you would think truth were a
3451	fool: drunkenness is his best virtue, for he will
3452	be swine-drunk; and in his sleep he does little
3453	harm, save to his bed-clothes about him; but they
3454	know his conditions and lay him in straw. I have but
3455	little more to say, sir, of his honesty: he has
3456	every thing that an honest man should not have; what
3457	an honest man should have, he has nothing.
3458	
3459	First Lord	I begin to love him for this.
3460	
3461	BERTRAM	For this description of thine honesty? A pox upon
3462	him for me, he's more and more a cat.
3463	
3464	First Soldier	What say you to his expertness in war?
3465	
3466	PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he has led the drum before the English
3467	tragedians; to belie him, I will not, and more of
3468	his soldiership I know not; except, in that country
3469	he had the honour to be the officer at a place there
3470	called Mile-end, to instruct for the doubling of
3471	files: I would do the man what honour I can, but of
3472	this I am not certain.
3473	
3474	First Lord	He hath out-villained villany so far, that the
3475	rarity redeems him.
3476	
3477	BERTRAM	A pox on him, he's a cat still.
3478	
3479	First Soldier	His qualities being at this poor price, I need not
3480	to ask you if gold will corrupt him to revolt.
3481	
3482	PAROLLES	Sir, for a quart d'ecu he will sell the fee-simple
3483	of his salvation, the inheritance of it; and cut the
3484	entail from all remainders, and a perpetual
3485	succession for it perpetually.
3486	
3487	First Soldier	What's his brother, the other Captain Dumain?
3488	
3489	Second Lord	Why does be ask him of me?
3490	
3491	First Soldier	What's he?
3492	
3493	PAROLLES	E'en a crow o' the same nest; not altogether so
3494	great as the first in goodness, but greater a great
3495	deal in evil: he excels his brother for a coward,
3496	yet his brother is reputed one of the best that is:
3497	in a retreat he outruns any lackey; marry, in coming
3498	on he has the cramp.
3499	
3500	First Soldier	If your life be saved, will you undertake to betray
3501	the Florentine?
3502	
3503	PAROLLES	Ay, and the captain of his horse, Count Rousillon.
3504	
3505	First Soldier	I'll whisper with the general, and know his pleasure.
3506	
3507	PAROLLES	[Aside]  I'll no more drumming; a plague of all
3508	drums! Only to seem to deserve well, and to
3509	beguile the supposition of that lascivious young boy
3510	the count, have I run into this danger. Yet who
3511	would have suspected an ambush where I was taken?
3512	
3513	First Soldier	There is no remedy, sir, but you must die: the
3514	general says, you that have so traitorously
3515	discovered the secrets of your army and made such
3516	pestiferous reports of men very nobly held, can
3517	serve the world for no honest use; therefore you
3518	must die. Come, headsman, off with his head.
3519	
3520	PAROLLES	O Lord, sir, let me live, or let me see my death!
3521	
3522	First Lord	That shall you, and take your leave of all your friends.
3523	
3524	[Unblinding him]
3525	
3526	So, look about you: know you any here?
3527	
3528	BERTRAM	Good morrow, noble captain.
3529	
3530	Second Lord	God bless you, Captain Parolles.
3531	
3532	First Lord	God save you, noble captain.
3533	
3534	Second Lord	Captain, what greeting will you to my Lord Lafeu?
3535	I am for France.
3536	
3537	First Lord	Good captain, will you give me a copy of the sonnet
3538	you writ to Diana in behalf of the Count Rousillon?
3539	an I were not a very coward, I'ld compel it of you:
3540	but fare you well.
3541	
3542	[Exeunt BERTRAM and Lords]
3543	
3544	First Soldier	You are undone, captain, all but your scarf; that
3545	has a knot on't yet
3546	
3547	PAROLLES	Who cannot be crushed with a plot?
3548	
3549	First Soldier	If you could find out a country where but women were
3550	that had received so much shame, you might begin an
3551	impudent nation. Fare ye well, sir; I am for France
3552	too: we shall speak of you there.
3553	
3554	[Exit with Soldiers]
3555	
3556	PAROLLES	Yet am I thankful: if my heart were great,
3557	'Twould burst at this. Captain I'll be no more;
3558	But I will eat and drink, and sleep as soft
3559	As captain shall: simply the thing I am
3560	Shall make me live. Who knows himself a braggart,
3561	Let him fear this, for it will come to pass
3562	that every braggart shall be found an ass.
3563	Rust, sword? cool, blushes! and, Parolles, live
3564	Safest in shame! being fool'd, by foolery thrive!
3565	There's place and means for every man alive.
3566	I'll after them.
3567	
3568	[Exit]

3579	
3580	SCENE IV	Florence. The Widow's house.
3581	
3582	
3583	[Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA]
3584	
3585	HELENA	That you may well perceive I have not wrong'd you,
3586	One of the greatest in the Christian world
3587	Shall be my surety; 'fore whose throne 'tis needful,
3588	Ere I can perfect mine intents, to kneel:
3589	Time was, I did him a desired office,
3590	Dear almost as his life; which gratitude
3591	Through flinty Tartar's bosom would peep forth,
3592	And answer, thanks: I duly am inform'd
3593	His grace is at Marseilles; to which place
3594	We have convenient convoy. You must know
3595	I am supposed dead: the army breaking,
3596	My husband hies him home; where, heaven aiding,
3597	And by the leave of my good lord the king,
3598	We'll be before our welcome.
3599	
3600	Widow	Gentle madam,
3601	You never had a servant to whose trust
3602	Your business was more welcome.
3603	
3604	HELENA	Nor you, mistress,
3605	Ever a friend whose thoughts more truly labour
3606	To recompense your love: doubt not but heaven
3607	Hath brought me up to be your daughter's dower,
3608	As it hath fated her to be my motive
3609	And helper to a husband. But, O strange men!
3610	That can such sweet use make of what they hate,
3611	When saucy trusting of the cozen'd thoughts
3612	Defiles the pitchy night: so lust doth play
3613	With what it loathes for that which is away.
3614	But more of this hereafter. You, Diana,
3615	Under my poor instructions yet must suffer
3616	Something in my behalf.
3617	
3618	DIANA	Let death and honesty
3619	Go with your impositions, I am yours
3620	Upon your will to suffer.
3621	
3622	HELENA	Yet, I pray you:
3623	But with the word the time will bring on summer,
3624	When briers shall have leaves as well as thorns,
3625	And be as sweet as sharp. We must away;
3626	Our wagon is prepared, and time revives us:
3627	All's well that ends well; still the fine's the crown;
3628	Whate'er the course, the end is the renown.
3629

3638	ACT IV
3639	
3640	
3641	
3642	SCENE V	Rousillon. The COUNT's palace.
3643	
3644	
3645	[Enter COUNTESS, LAFEU, and Clown]
3646	
3647	LAFEU	No, no, no, your son was misled with a snipt-taffeta
3648	fellow there, whose villanous saffron would have
3649	made all the unbaked and doughy youth of a nation in
3650	his colour: your daughter-in-law had been alive at
3651	this hour, and your son here at home, more advanced
3652	by the king than by that red-tailed humble-bee I speak of.
3653	
3654	COUNTESS	I would I had not known him; it was the death of the
3655	most virtuous gentlewoman that ever nature had
3656	praise for creating. If she had partaken of my
3657	flesh, and cost me the dearest groans of a mother, I
3658	could not have owed her a more rooted love.
3659	
3660	LAFEU	'Twas a good lady, 'twas a good lady: we may pick a
3661	thousand salads ere we light on such another herb.
3662	
3663	Clown	Indeed, sir, she was the sweet marjoram of the
3664	salad, or rather, the herb of grace.
3665	
3666	LAFEU	They are not herbs, you knave; they are nose-herbs.
3667	
3668	Clown	I am no great Nebuchadnezzar, sir; I have not much
3669	skill in grass.
3670	
3671	LAFEU	Whether dost thou profess thyself, a knave or a fool?
3672	
3673	Clown	A fool, sir, at a woman's service, and a knave at a man's.
3674	
3675	LAFEU	Your distinction?
3676	
3677	Clown	I would cozen the man of his wife and do his service.
3678	
3679	LAFEU	So you were a knave at his service, indeed.
3680	
3681	Clown	And I would give his wife my bauble, sir, to do her service.
3682	
3683	LAFEU	I will subscribe for thee, thou art both knave and fool.
3684	
3685	Clown	At your service.
3686	
3687	LAFEU	No, no, no.
3688	
3689	Clown	Why, sir, if I cannot serve you, I can serve as
3690	great a prince as you are.
3691	
3692	LAFEU	Who's that? a Frenchman?
3693	
3694	Clown	Faith, sir, a' has an English name; but his fisnomy
3695	is more hotter in France than there.
3696	
3697	LAFEU	What prince is that?
3698	
3699	Clown	The black prince, sir; alias, the prince of
3700	darkness; alias, the devil.
3701	
3702	LAFEU	Hold thee, there's my purse: I give thee not this
3703	to suggest thee from thy master thou talkest of;
3704	serve him still.
3705	
3706	Clown	I am a woodland fellow, sir, that always loved a
3707	great fire; and the master I speak of ever keeps a
3708	good fire. But, sure, he is the prince of the
3709	world; let his nobility remain in's court. I am for
3710	the house with the narrow gate, which I take to be
3711	too little for pomp to enter: some that humble
3712	themselves may; but the many will be too chill and
3713	tender, and they'll be for the flowery way that
3714	leads to the broad gate and the great fire.
3715	
3716	LAFEU	Go thy ways, I begin to be aweary of thee; and I
3717	tell thee so before, because I would not fall out
3718	with thee. Go thy ways: let my horses be well
3719	looked to, without any tricks.
3720	
3721	Clown	If I put any tricks upon 'em, sir, they shall be
3722	jades' tricks; which are their own right by the law of nature.
3723	
3724	[Exit]
3725	
3726	LAFEU	A shrewd knave and an unhappy.
3727	
3728	COUNTESS	So he is. My lord that's gone made himself much
3729	sport out of him: by his authority he remains here,
3730	which he thinks is a patent for his sauciness; and,
3731	indeed, he has no pace, but runs where he will.
3732	
3733	LAFEU	I like him well; 'tis not amiss. And I was about to
3734	tell you, since I heard of the good lady's death and
3735	that my lord your son was upon his return home, I
3736	moved the king my master to speak in the behalf of
3737	my daughter; which, in the minority of them both,
3738	his majesty, out of a self-gracious remembrance, did
3739	first propose: his highness hath promised me to do
3740	it: and, to stop up the displeasure he hath
3741	conceived against your son, there is no fitter
3742	matter. How does your ladyship like it?
3743	
3744	COUNTESS	With very much content, my lord; and I wish it
3745	happily effected.
3746	
3747	LAFEU	His highness comes post from Marseilles, of as able
3748	body as when he numbered thirty: he will be here
3749	to-morrow, or I am deceived by him that in such
3750	intelligence hath seldom failed.
3751	
3752	COUNTESS	It rejoices me, that I hope I shall see him ere I
3753	die. I have letters that my son will be here
3754	to-night: I shall beseech your lordship to remain
3755	with me till they meet together.
3756	
3757	LAFEU	Madam, I was thinking with what manners I might
3758	safely be admitted.
3759	
3760	COUNTESS	You need but plead your honourable privilege.
3761	
3762	LAFEU	Lady, of that I have made a bold charter; but I
3763	thank my God it holds yet.
3764	
3765	[Re-enter Clown]
3766	
3767	Clown	O madam, yonder's my lord your son with a patch of
3768	velvet on's face: whether there be a scar under't
3769	or no, the velvet knows; but 'tis a goodly patch of
3770	velvet: his left cheek is a cheek of two pile and a
3771	half, but his right cheek is worn bare.
3772	
3773	LAFEU	A scar nobly got, or a noble scar, is a good livery
3774	of honour; so belike is that.
3775	
3776	Clown	But it is your carbonadoed face.
3777	
3778	LAFEU	Let us go see your son, I pray you: I long to talk
3779	with the young noble soldier.
3780	
3781	Clown	Faith there's a dozen of 'em, with delicate fine
3782	hats and most courteous feathers, which bow the head
3783	and nod at every man.

3799	[Enter HELENA, Widow, and DIANA, with two
3800	Attendants]
3801	
3802	HELENA	But this exceeding posting day and night
3803	Must wear your spirits low; we cannot help it:
3804	But since you have made the days and nights as one,
3805	To wear your gentle limbs in my affairs,
3806	Be bold you do so grow in my requital
3807	As nothing can unroot you. In happy time;
3808	
3809	[Enter a Gentleman]
3810	
3811	This man may help me to his majesty's ear,
3812	If he would spend his power. God save you, sir.
3813	
3814	Gentleman	And you.
3815	
3816	HELENA	Sir, I have seen you in the court of France.
3817	
3818	Gentleman	I have been sometimes there.
3819	
3820	HELENA	I do presume, sir, that you are not fallen
3821	From the report that goes upon your goodness;
3822	An therefore, goaded with most sharp occasions,
3823	Which lay nice manners by, I put you to
3824	The use of your own virtues, for the which
3825	I shall continue thankful.
3826	
3827	Gentleman	What's your will?
3828	
3829	HELENA	That it will please you
3830	To give this poor petition to the king,
3831	And aid me with that store of power you have
3832	To come into his presence.
3833	
3834	Gentleman	The king's not here.
3835	
3836	HELENA	Not here, sir!
3837	
3838	Gentleman	Not, indeed:
3839	He hence removed last night and with more haste
3840	Than is his use.
3841	
3842	Widow	                  Lord, how we lose our pains!
3843	
3844	HELENA	ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL yet,
3845	Though time seem so adverse and means unfit.
3846	I do beseech you, whither is he gone?
3847	
3848	Gentleman	Marry, as I take it, to Rousillon;
3849	Whither I am going.
3850	
3851	HELENA	I do beseech you, sir,
3852	Since you are like to see the king before me,
3853	Commend the paper to his gracious hand,
3854	Which I presume shall render you no blame
3855	But rather make you thank your pains for it.
3856	I will come after you with what good speed
3857	Our means will make us means.
3858	
3859	Gentleman	This I'll do for you.
3860	
3861	HELENA	And you shall find yourself to be well thank'd,
3862	Whate'er falls more. We must to horse again.
3863	Go, go, provide.

3878	
3879	
3880	[Enter Clown, and PAROLLES, following]
3881	
3882	PAROLLES	Good Monsieur Lavache, give my Lord Lafeu this
3883	letter: I have ere now, sir, been better known to
3884	you, when I have held familiarity with fresher
3885	clothes; but I am now, sir, muddied in fortune's
3886	mood, and smell somewhat strong of her strong
3887	displeasure.
3888	
3889	Clown	Truly, fortune's displeasure is but sluttish, if it
3890	smell so strongly as thou speakest of: I will
3891	henceforth eat no fish of fortune's buttering.
3892	Prithee, allow the wind.
3893	
3894	PAROLLES	Nay, you need not to stop your nose, sir; I spake
3895	but by a metaphor.
3896	
3897	Clown	Indeed, sir, if your metaphor stink, I will stop my
3898	nose; or against any man's metaphor. Prithee, get
3899	thee further.
3900	
3901	PAROLLES	Pray you, sir, deliver me this paper.
3902	
3903	Clown	Foh! prithee, stand away: a paper from fortune's
3904	close-stool to give to a nobleman! Look, here he
3905	comes himself.
3906	
3907	[Enter LAFEU]
3908	
3909	Here is a purr of fortune's, sir, or of fortune's
3910	cat,--but not a musk-cat,--that has fallen into the
3911	unclean fishpond of her displeasure, and, as he
3912	says, is muddied withal: pray you, sir, use the
3913	carp as you may; for he looks like a poor, decayed,
3914	ingenious, foolish, rascally knave. I do pity his
3915	distress in my similes of comfort and leave him to
3916	your lordship.
3917	
3918	[Exit]
3919	
3920	PAROLLES	My lord, I am a man whom fortune hath cruelly
3921	scratched.
3922	
3923	LAFEU	And what would you have me to do? 'Tis too late to
3924	pare her nails now. Wherein have you played the
3925	knave with fortune, that she should scratch you, who
3926	of herself is a good lady and would not have knaves
3927	thrive long under her? There's a quart d'ecu for
3928	you: let the justices make you and fortune friends:
3929	I am for other business.
3930	
3931	PAROLLES	I beseech your honour to hear me one single word.
3932	
3933	LAFEU	You beg a single penny more: come, you shall ha't;
3934	save your word.
3935	
3936	PAROLLES	My name, my good lord, is Parolles.
3937	
3938	LAFEU	You beg more than 'word,' then. Cox my passion!
3939	give me your hand. How does your drum?
3940	
3941	PAROLLES	O my good lord, you were the first that found me!
3942	
3943	LAFEU	Was I, in sooth? and I was the first that lost thee.
3944	
3945	PAROLLES	It lies in you, my lord, to bring me in some grace,
3946	for you did bring me out.
3947	
3948	LAFEU	Out upon thee, knave! dost thou put upon me at once
3949	both the office of God and the devil? One brings
3950	thee in grace and the other brings thee out.
3951	
3952	[Trumpets sound]
3953	
3954	The king's coming; I know by his trumpets. Sirrah,
3955	inquire further after me; I had talk of you last
3956	night: though you are a fool and a knave, you shall
3957	eat; go to, follow.

3974	
3975	
3976	[Flourish. Enter KING, COUNTESS, LAFEU, the two
3977	French Lords, with Attendants]
3978	
3979	KING	We lost a jewel of her; and our esteem
3980	Was made much poorer by it: but your son,
3981	As mad in folly, lack'd the sense to know
3982	Her estimation home.
3983	
3984	COUNTESS	'Tis past, my liege;
3985	And I beseech your majesty to make it
3986	Natural rebellion, done i' the blaze of youth;
3987	When oil and fire, too strong for reason's force,
3988	O'erbears it and burns on.
3989	
3990	KING	My honour'd lady,
3991	I have forgiven and forgotten all;
3992	Though my revenges were high bent upon him,
3993	And watch'd the time to shoot.
3994	
3995	LAFEU	This I must say,
3996	But first I beg my pardon, the young lord
3997	Did to his majesty, his mother and his lady
3998	Offence of mighty note; but to himself
3999	The greatest wrong of all. He lost a wife
4000	Whose beauty did astonish the survey
4001	Of richest eyes, whose words all ears took captive,
4002	Whose dear perfection hearts that scorn'd to serve
4003	Humbly call'd mistress.
4004	
4005	KING	Praising what is lost
4006	Makes the remembrance dear. Well, call him hither;
4007	We are reconciled, and the first view shall kill
4008	All repetition: let him not ask our pardon;
4009	The nature of his great offence is dead,
4010	And deeper than oblivion we do bury
4011	The incensing relics of it: let him approach,
4012	A stranger, no offender; and inform him
4013	So 'tis our will he should.
4014	
4015	Gentleman	I shall, my liege.
4016	
4017	[Exit]
4018	
4019	KING	What says he to your daughter? have you spoke?
4020	
4021	LAFEU	All that he is hath reference to your highness.
4022	
4023	KING	Then shall we have a match. I have letters sent me
4024	That set him high in fame.
4025	
4026	[Enter BERTRAM]
4027	
4028	LAFEU	He looks well on't.
4029	
4030	KING	I am not a day of season,
4031	For thou mayst see a sunshine and a hail
4032	In me at once: but to the brightest beams
4033	Distracted clouds give way; so stand thou forth;
4034	The time is fair again.
4035	
4036	BERTRAM	My high-repented blames,
4037	Dear sovereign, pardon to me.
4038	
4039	KING	All is whole;
4040	Not one word more of the consumed time.
4041	Let's take the instant by the forward top;
4042	For we are old, and on our quick'st decrees
4043	The inaudible and noiseless foot of Time
4044	Steals ere we can effect them. You remember
4045	The daughter of this lord?
4046	
4047	BERTRAM	Admiringly, my liege, at first
4048	I stuck my choice upon her, ere my heart
4049	Durst make too bold a herald of my tongue
4050	Where the impression of mine eye infixing,
4051	Contempt his scornful perspective did lend me,
4052	Which warp'd the line of every other favour;
4053	Scorn'd a fair colour, or express'd it stolen;
4054	Extended or contracted all proportions
4055	To a most hideous object: thence it came
4056	That she whom all men praised and whom myself,
4057	Since I have lost, have loved, was in mine eye
4058	The dust that did offend it.
4059	
4060	KING	Well excused:
4061	That thou didst love her, strikes some scores away
4062	From the great compt: but love that comes too late,
4063	Like a remorseful pardon slowly carried,
4064	To the great sender turns a sour offence,
4065	Crying, 'That's good that's gone.' Our rash faults
4066	Make trivial price of serious things we have,
4067	Not knowing them until we know their grave:
4068	Oft our displeasures, to ourselves unjust,
4069	Destroy our friends and after weep their dust
4070	Our own love waking cries to see what's done,
4071	While shame full late sleeps out the afternoon.
4072	Be this sweet Helen's knell, and now forget her.
4073	Send forth your amorous token for fair Maudlin:
4074	The main consents are had; and here we'll stay
4075	To see our widower's second marriage-day.
4076	
4077	COUNTESS	Which better than the first, O dear heaven, bless!
4078	Or, ere they meet, in me, O nature, cesse!
4079	
4080	LAFEU	Come on, my son, in whom my house's name
4081	Must be digested, give a favour from you
4082	To sparkle in the spirits of my daughter,
4083	That she may quickly come.
4084	
4085	[BERTRAM gives a ring]
4086	
4087	By my old beard,
4088	And every hair that's on't, Helen, that's dead,
4089	Was a sweet creature: such a ring as this,
4090	The last that e'er I took her at court,
4091	I saw upon her finger.
4092	
4093	BERTRAM	Hers it was not.
4094	
4095	KING	Now, pray you, let me see it; for mine eye,
4096	While I was speaking, oft was fasten'd to't.
4097	This ring was mine; and, when I gave it Helen,
4098	I bade her, if her fortunes ever stood
4099	Necessitied to help, that by this token
4100	I would relieve her. Had you that craft, to reave
4101	her
4102	Of what should stead her most?
4103	
4104	BERTRAM	My gracious sovereign,
4105	Howe'er it pleases you to take it so,
4106	The ring was never hers.
4107	
4108	COUNTESS	Son, on my life,
4109	I have seen her wear it; and she reckon'd it
4110	At her life's rate.
4111	
4112	LAFEU	I am sure I saw her wear it.
4113	
4114	BERTRAM	You are deceived, my lord; she never saw it:
4115	In Florence was it from a casement thrown me,
4116	Wrapp'd in a paper, which contain'd the name
4117	Of her that threw it: noble she was, and thought
4118	I stood engaged: but when I had subscribed
4119	To mine own fortune and inform'd her fully
4120	I could not answer in that course of honour
4121	As she had made the overture, she ceased
4122	In heavy satisfaction and would never
4123	Receive the ring again.
4124	
4125	KING	Plutus himself,
4126	That knows the tinct and multiplying medicine,
4127	Hath not in nature's mystery more science
4128	Than I have in this ring: 'twas mine, 'twas Helen's,
4129	Whoever gave it you. Then, if you know
4130	That you are well acquainted with yourself,
4131	Confess 'twas hers, and by what rough enforcement
4132	You got it from her: she call'd the saints to surety
4133	That she would never put it from her finger,
4134	Unless she gave it to yourself in bed,
4135	Where you have never come, or sent it us
4136	Upon her great disaster.
4137	
4138	BERTRAM	She never saw it.
4139	
4140	KING	Thou speak'st it falsely, as I love mine honour;
4141	And makest conjectural fears to come into me
4142	Which I would fain shut out. If it should prove
4143	That thou art so inhuman,--'twill not prove so;--
4144	And yet I know not: thou didst hate her deadly,
4145	And she is dead; which nothing, but to close
4146	Her eyes myself, could win me to believe,
4147	More than to see this ring. Take him away.
4148	
4149	[Guards seize BERTRAM]
4150	
4151	My fore-past proofs, howe'er the matter fall,
4152	Shall tax my fears of little vanity,
4153	Having vainly fear'd too little. Away with him!
4154	We'll sift this matter further.
4155	
4156	BERTRAM	If you shall prove
4157	This ring was ever hers, you shall as easy
4158	Prove that I husbanded her bed in Florence,
4159	Where yet she never was.
4160	
4161	[Exit, guarded]
4162	
4163	KING	I am wrapp'd in dismal thinkings.
4164	
4165	[Enter a Gentleman]
4166	
4167	Gentleman	Gracious sovereign,
4168	Whether I have been to blame or no, I know not:
4169	Here's a petition from a Florentine,
4170	Who hath for four or five removes come short
4171	To tender it herself. I undertook it,
4172	Vanquish'd thereto by the fair grace and speech
4173	Of the poor suppliant, who by this I know
4174	Is here attending: her business looks in her
4175	With an importing visage; and she told me,
4176	In a sweet verbal brief, it did concern
4177	Your highness with herself.
4178	
4179	KING	[Reads]  Upon his many protestations to marry me
4180	when his wife was dead, I blush to say it, he won
4181	me. Now is the Count Rousillon a widower: his vows
4182	are forfeited to me, and my honour's paid to him. He
4183	stole from Florence, taking no leave, and I follow
4184	him to his country for justice: grant it me, O
4185	king! in you it best lies; otherwise a seducer
4186	flourishes, and a poor maid is undone.
4187	DIANA CAPILET.
4188	
4189	LAFEU	I will buy me a son-in-law in a fair, and toll for
4190	this: I'll none of him.
4191	
4192	KING	The heavens have thought well on thee Lafeu,
4193	To bring forth this discovery. Seek these suitors:
4194	Go speedily and bring again the count.
4195	I am afeard the life of Helen, lady,
4196	Was foully snatch'd.
4197	
4198	COUNTESS	Now, justice on the doers!
4199	
4200	[Re-enter BERTRAM, guarded]
4201	
4202	KING	I wonder, sir, sith wives are monsters to you,
4203	And that you fly them as you swear them lordship,
4204	Yet you desire to marry.
4205	
4206	[Enter Widow and DIANA]
4207	
4208	What woman's that?
4209	
4210	DIANA	I am, my lord, a wretched Florentine,
4211	Derived from the ancient Capilet:
4212	My suit, as I do understand, you know,
4213	And therefore know how far I may be pitied.
4214	
4215	Widow	I am her mother, sir, whose age and honour
4216	Both suffer under this complaint we bring,
4217	And both shall cease, without your remedy.
4218	
4219	KING	Come hither, count; do you know these women?
4220	
4221	BERTRAM	My lord, I neither can nor will deny
4222	But that I know them: do they charge me further?
4223	
4224	DIANA	Why do you look so strange upon your wife?
4225	
4226	BERTRAM	She's none of mine, my lord.
4227	
4228	DIANA	If you shall marry,
4229	You give away this hand, and that is mine;
4230	You give away heaven's vows, and those are mine;
4231	You give away myself, which is known mine;
4232	For I by vow am so embodied yours,
4233	That she which marries you must marry me,
4234	Either both or none.
4235	
4236	LAFEU	Your reputation comes too short for my daughter; you
4237	are no husband for her.
4238	
4239	BERTRAM	My lord, this is a fond and desperate creature,
4240	Whom sometime I have laugh'd with: let your highness
4241	Lay a more noble thought upon mine honour
4242	Than for to think that I would sink it here.
4243	
4244	KING	Sir, for my thoughts, you have them ill to friend
4245	Till your deeds gain them: fairer prove your honour
4246	Than in my thought it lies.
4247	
4248	DIANA	Good my lord,
4249	Ask him upon his oath, if he does think
4250	He had not my virginity.
4251	
4252	KING	What say'st thou to her?
4253	
4254	BERTRAM	She's impudent, my lord,
4255	And was a common gamester to the camp.
4256	
4257	DIANA	He does me wrong, my lord; if I were so,
4258	He might have bought me at a common price:
4259	Do not believe him. O, behold this ring,
4260	Whose high respect and rich validity
4261	Did lack a parallel; yet for all that
4262	He gave it to a commoner o' the camp,
4263	If I be one.
4264	
4265	COUNTESS	                  He blushes, and 'tis it:
4266	Of six preceding ancestors, that gem,
4267	Conferr'd by testament to the sequent issue,
4268	Hath it been owed and worn. This is his wife;
4269	That ring's a thousand proofs.
4270	
4271	KING	Methought you said
4272	You saw one here in court could witness it.
4273	
4274	DIANA	I did, my lord, but loath am to produce
4275	So bad an instrument: his name's Parolles.
4276	
4277	LAFEU	I saw the man to-day, if man he be.
4278	
4279	KING	Find him, and bring him hither.
4280	
4281	[Exit an Attendant]
4282	
4283	BERTRAM	What of him?
4284	He's quoted for a most perfidious slave,
4285	With all the spots o' the world tax'd and debosh'd;
4286	Whose nature sickens but to speak a truth.
4287	Am I or that or this for what he'll utter,
4288	That will speak any thing?
4289	
4290	KING	She hath that ring of yours.
4291	
4292	BERTRAM	I think she has: certain it is I liked her,
4293	And boarded her i' the wanton way of youth:
4294	She knew her distance and did angle for me,
4295	Madding my eagerness with her restraint,
4296	As all impediments in fancy's course
4297	Are motives of more fancy; and, in fine,
4298	Her infinite cunning, with her modern grace,
4299	Subdued me to her rate: she got the ring;
4300	And I had that which any inferior might
4301	At market-price have bought.
4302	
4303	DIANA	I must be patient:
4304	You, that have turn'd off a first so noble wife,
4305	May justly diet me. I pray you yet;
4306	Since you lack virtue, I will lose a husband;
4307	Send for your ring, I will return it home,
4308	And give me mine again.
4309	
4310	BERTRAM	I have it not.
4311	
4312	KING	What ring was yours, I pray you?
4313	
4314	DIANA	Sir, much like
4315	The same upon your finger.
4316	
4317	KING	Know you this ring? this ring was his of late.
4318	
4319	DIANA	And this was it I gave him, being abed.
4320	
4321	KING	The story then goes false, you threw it him
4322	Out of a casement.
4323	
4324	DIANA	                  I have spoke the truth.
4325	
4326	[Enter PAROLLES]
4327	
4328	BERTRAM	My lord, I do confess the ring was hers.
4329	
4330	KING	You boggle shrewdly, every feather stars you.
4331	Is this the man you speak of?
4332	
4333	DIANA	Ay, my lord.
4334	
4335	KING	Tell me, sirrah, but tell me true, I charge you,
4336	Not fearing the displeasure of your master,
4337	Which on your just proceeding I'll keep off,
4338	By him and by this woman here what know you?
4339	
4340	PAROLLES	So please your majesty, my master hath been an
4341	honourable gentleman: tricks he hath had in him,
4342	which gentlemen have.
4343	
4344	KING	Come, come, to the purpose: did he love this woman?
4345	
4346	PAROLLES	Faith, sir, he did love her; but how?
4347	
4348	KING	How, I pray you?
4349	
4350	PAROLLES	He did love her, sir, as a gentleman loves a woman.
4351	
4352	KING	How is that?
4353	
4354	PAROLLES	He loved her, sir, and loved her not.
4355	
4356	KING	As thou art a knave, and no knave. What an
4357	equivocal companion is this!
4358	
4359	PAROLLES	I am a poor man, and at your majesty's command.
4360	
4361	LAFEU	He's a good drum, my lord, but a naughty orator.
4362	
4363	DIANA	Do you know he promised me marriage?
4364	
4365	PAROLLES	Faith, I know more than I'll speak.
4366	
4367	KING	But wilt thou not speak all thou knowest?
4368	
4369	PAROLLES	Yes, so please your majesty. I did go between them,
4370	as I said; but more than that, he loved her: for
4371	indeed he was mad for her, and talked of Satan and
4372	of Limbo and of Furies and I know not what: yet I
4373	was in that credit with them at that time that I
4374	knew of their going to bed, and of other motions,
4375	as promising her marriage, and things which would
4376	derive me ill will to speak of; therefore I will not
4377	speak what I know.
4378	
4379	KING	Thou hast spoken all already, unless thou canst say
4380	they are married: but thou art too fine in thy
4381	evidence; therefore stand aside.
4382	This ring, you say, was yours?
4383	
4384	DIANA	Ay, my good lord.
4385	
4386	KING	Where did you buy it? or who gave it you?
4387	
4388	DIANA	It was not given me, nor I did not buy it.
4389	
4390	KING	Who lent it you?
4391	
4392	DIANA	                  It was not lent me neither.
4393	
4394	KING	Where did you find it, then?
4395	
4396	DIANA	I found it not.
4397	
4398	KING	If it were yours by none of all these ways,
4399	How could you give it him?
4400	
4401	DIANA	I never gave it him.
4402	
4403	LAFEU	This woman's an easy glove, my lord; she goes off
4404	and on at pleasure.
4405	
4406	KING	This ring was mine; I gave it his first wife.
4407	
4408	DIANA	It might be yours or hers, for aught I know.
4409	
4410	KING	Take her away; I do not like her now;
4411	To prison with her: and away with him.
4412	Unless thou tell'st me where thou hadst this ring,
4413	Thou diest within this hour.
4414	
4415	DIANA	I'll never tell you.
4416	
4417	KING	Take her away.
4418	
4419	DIANA	                  I'll put in bail, my liege.
4420	
4421	KING	I think thee now some common customer.
4422	
4423	DIANA	By Jove, if ever I knew man, 'twas you.
4424	
4425	KING	Wherefore hast thou accused him all this while?
4426	
4427	DIANA	Because he's guilty, and he is not guilty:
4428	He knows I am no maid, and he'll swear to't;
4429	I'll swear I am a maid, and he knows not.
4430	Great king, I am no strumpet, by my life;
4431	I am either maid, or else this old man's wife.
4432	
4433	KING	She does abuse our ears: to prison with her.
4434	
4435	DIANA	Good mother, fetch my bail. Stay, royal sir:
4436	
4437	[Exit Widow]
4438	
4439	The jeweller that owes the ring is sent for,
4440	And he shall surety me. But for this lord,
4441	Who hath abused me, as he knows himself,
4442	Though yet he never harm'd me, here I quit him:
4443	He knows himself my bed he hath defiled;
4444	And at that time he got his wife with child:
4445	Dead though she be, she feels her young one kick:
4446	So there's my riddle: one that's dead is quick:
4447	And now behold the meaning.
4448	
4449	[Re-enter Widow, with HELENA]
4450	
4451	KING	Is there no exorcist
4452	Beguiles the truer office of mine eyes?
4453	Is't real that I see?
4454	
4455	HELENA	No, my good lord;
4456	'Tis but the shadow of a wife you see,
4457	The name and not the thing.
4458	
4459	BERTRAM	Both, both. O, pardon!
4460	
4461	HELENA	O my good lord, when I was like this maid,
4462	I found you wondrous kind. There is your ring;
4463	And, look you, here's your letter; this it says:
4464	'When from my finger you can get this ring
4465	And are by me with child,' &c. This is done:
4466	Will you be mine, now you are doubly won?
4467	
4468	BERTRAM	If she, my liege, can make me know this clearly,
4469	I'll love her dearly, ever, ever dearly.
4470	
4471	HELENA	If it appear not plain and prove untrue,
4472	Deadly divorce step between me and you!
4473	O my dear mother, do I see you living?
4474	
4475	LAFEU	Mine eyes smell onions; I shall weep anon:
4476	
4477	[To PAROLLES]
4478	
4479	Good Tom Drum, lend me a handkercher: so,
4480	I thank thee: wait on me home, I'll make sport with thee:
4481	Let thy courtesies alone, they are scurvy ones.
4482	
4483	KING	Let us from point to point this story know,
4484	To make the even truth in pleasure flow.
4485	
4486	[To DIANA]
4487	
4488	If thou be'st yet a fresh uncropped flower,
4489	Choose thou thy husband, and I'll pay thy dower;
4490	For I can guess that by thy honest aid
4491	Thou keep'st a wife herself, thyself a maid.
4492	Of that and all the progress, more or less,
4493	Resolvedly more leisure shall express:
4494	All yet seems well; and if it end so meet,
4495	The bitter past, more welcome is the sweet.
4496	
4497	[Flourish]
4498	
4499	
4500	
4501	
4502	ALL'S WELL THAT ENDS WELL
4503	
4504	EPILOGUE
4505	
4506	
4507	KING	The king's a beggar, now the play is done:
4508	All is well ended, if this suit be won,
4509	That you express content; which we will pay,
4510	With strife to please you, day exceeding day:
4511	Ours be your patience then, and yours our parts;
4512	Your gentle hands lend us, and take our hearts.
4513	
4514	[Exeunt]

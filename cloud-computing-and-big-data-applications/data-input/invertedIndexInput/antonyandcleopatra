108	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
109	
110	
111	ACT I
112	
113	
114	
115	SCENE I	Alexandria. A room in CLEOPATRA's palace.
116	
117	
118	[Enter DEMETRIUS and PHILO]
119	
120	PHILO	Nay, but this dotage of our general's
121	O'erflows the measure: those his goodly eyes,
122	That o'er the files and musters of the war
123	Have glow'd like plated Mars, now bend, now turn,
124	The office and devotion of their view
125	Upon a tawny front: his captain's heart,
126	Which in the scuffles of great fights hath burst
127	The buckles on his breast, reneges all temper,
128	And is become the bellows and the fan
129	To cool a gipsy's lust.
130	
131	[Flourish. Enter ANTONY, CLEOPATRA, her Ladies,
132	the Train, with Eunuchs fanning her]
133	
134	Look, where they come:
135	Take but good note, and you shall see in him.
136	The triple pillar of the world transform'd
137	Into a strumpet's fool: behold and see.
138	
139	CLEOPATRA	If it be love indeed, tell me how much.
140	
141	MARK ANTONY	There's beggary in the love that can be reckon'd.
142	
143	CLEOPATRA	I'll set a bourn how far to be beloved.
144	
145	MARK ANTONY	Then must thou needs find out new heaven, new earth.
146	
147	[Enter an Attendant]
148	
149	Attendant	News, my good lord, from Rome.
150	
151	MARK ANTONY	Grates me: the sum.
152	
153	CLEOPATRA	Nay, hear them, Antony:
154	Fulvia perchance is angry; or, who knows
155	If the scarce-bearded Caesar have not sent
156	His powerful mandate to you, 'Do this, or this;
157	Take in that kingdom, and enfranchise that;
158	Perform 't, or else we damn thee.'
159	
160	MARK ANTONY	How, my love!
161	
162	CLEOPATRA	Perchance! nay, and most like:
163	You must not stay here longer, your dismission
164	Is come from Caesar; therefore hear it, Antony.
165	Where's Fulvia's process? Caesar's I would say? both?
166	Call in the messengers. As I am Egypt's queen,
167	Thou blushest, Antony; and that blood of thine
168	Is Caesar's homager: else so thy cheek pays shame
169	When shrill-tongued Fulvia scolds. The messengers!
170	
171	MARK ANTONY	Let Rome in Tiber melt, and the wide arch
172	Of the ranged empire fall! Here is my space.
173	Kingdoms are clay: our dungy earth alike
174	Feeds beast as man: the nobleness of life
175	Is to do thus; when such a mutual pair
176	
177	[Embracing]
178	
179	And such a twain can do't, in which I bind,
180	On pain of punishment, the world to weet
181	We stand up peerless.
182	
183	CLEOPATRA	Excellent falsehood!
184	Why did he marry Fulvia, and not love her?
185	I'll seem the fool I am not; Antony
186	Will be himself.
187	
188	MARK ANTONY	                  But stirr'd by Cleopatra.
189	Now, for the love of Love and her soft hours,
190	Let's not confound the time with conference harsh:
191	There's not a minute of our lives should stretch
192	Without some pleasure now. What sport tonight?
193	
194	CLEOPATRA	Hear the ambassadors.
195	
196	MARK ANTONY	Fie, wrangling queen!
197	Whom every thing becomes, to chide, to laugh,
198	To weep; whose every passion fully strives
199	To make itself, in thee, fair and admired!
200	No messenger, but thine; and all alone
201	To-night we'll wander through the streets and note
202	The qualities of people. Come, my queen;
203	Last night you did desire it: speak not to us.
204	
205	[Exeunt MARK ANTONY and CLEOPATRA with
206	their train]
207	
208	DEMETRIUS	Is Caesar with Antonius prized so slight?
209	
210	PHILO	Sir, sometimes, when he is not Antony,
211	He comes too short of that great property
212	Which still should go with Antony.
213	
214	DEMETRIUS	I am full sorry
215	That he approves the common liar, who
216	Thus speaks of him at Rome: but I will hope
217	Of better deeds to-morrow. Rest you happy!
218

230	
231	SCENE II	The same. Another room.
232	
233	
234	[Enter CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, and a Soothsayer]
235	
236	CHARMIAN	Lord Alexas, sweet Alexas, most any thing Alexas,
237	almost most absolute Alexas, where's the soothsayer
238	that you praised so to the queen? O, that I knew
239	this husband, which, you say, must charge his horns
240	with garlands!
241	
242	ALEXAS	Soothsayer!
243	
244	Soothsayer	Your will?
245	
246	CHARMIAN	Is this the man? Is't you, sir, that know things?
247	
248	Soothsayer	In nature's infinite book of secrecy
249	A little I can read.
250	
251	ALEXAS	Show him your hand.
252	
253	[Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
254	
255	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Bring in the banquet quickly; wine enough
256	Cleopatra's health to drink.
257	
258	CHARMIAN	Good sir, give me good fortune.
259	
260	Soothsayer	I make not, but foresee.
261	
262	CHARMIAN	Pray, then, foresee me one.
263	
264	Soothsayer	You shall be yet far fairer than you are.
265	
266	CHARMIAN	He means in flesh.
267	
268	IRAS	No, you shall paint when you are old.
269	
270	CHARMIAN	Wrinkles forbid!
271	
272	ALEXAS	Vex not his prescience; be attentive.
273	
274	CHARMIAN	Hush!
275	
276	Soothsayer	You shall be more beloving than beloved.
277	
278	CHARMIAN	I had rather heat my liver with drinking.
279	
280	ALEXAS	Nay, hear him.
281	
282	CHARMIAN	Good now, some excellent fortune! Let me be married
283	to three kings in a forenoon, and widow them all:
284	let me have a child at fifty, to whom Herod of Jewry
285	may do homage: find me to marry me with Octavius
286	Caesar, and companion me with my mistress.
287	
288	Soothsayer	You shall outlive the lady whom you serve.
289	
290	CHARMIAN	O excellent! I love long life better than figs.
291	
292	Soothsayer	You have seen and proved a fairer former fortune
293	Than that which is to approach.
294	
295	CHARMIAN	Then belike my children shall have no names:
296	prithee, how many boys and wenches must I have?
297	
298	Soothsayer	If every of your wishes had a womb.
299	And fertile every wish, a million.
300	
301	CHARMIAN	Out, fool! I forgive thee for a witch.
302	
303	ALEXAS	You think none but your sheets are privy to your wishes.
304	
305	CHARMIAN	Nay, come, tell Iras hers.
306	
307	ALEXAS	We'll know all our fortunes.
308	
309	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Mine, and most of our fortunes, to-night, shall
310	be--drunk to bed.
311	
312	IRAS	There's a palm presages chastity, if nothing else.
313	
314	CHARMIAN	E'en as the o'erflowing Nilus presageth famine.
315	
316	IRAS	Go, you wild bedfellow, you cannot soothsay.
317	
318	CHARMIAN	Nay, if an oily palm be not a fruitful
319	prognostication, I cannot scratch mine ear. Prithee,
320	tell her but a worky-day fortune.
321	
322	Soothsayer	Your fortunes are alike.
323	
324	IRAS	But how, but how? give me particulars.
325	
326	Soothsayer	I have said.
327	
328	IRAS	Am I not an inch of fortune better than she?
329	
330	CHARMIAN	Well, if you were but an inch of fortune better than
331	I, where would you choose it?
332	
333	IRAS	Not in my husband's nose.
334	
335	CHARMIAN	Our worser thoughts heavens mend! Alexas,--come,
336	his fortune, his fortune! O, let him marry a woman
337	that cannot go, sweet Isis, I beseech thee! and let
338	her die too, and give him a worse! and let worst
339	follow worse, till the worst of all follow him
340	laughing to his grave, fifty-fold a cuckold! Good
341	Isis, hear me this prayer, though thou deny me a
342	matter of more weight; good Isis, I beseech thee!
343	
344	IRAS	Amen. Dear goddess, hear that prayer of the people!
345	for, as it is a heartbreaking to see a handsome man
346	loose-wived, so it is a deadly sorrow to behold a
347	foul knave uncuckolded: therefore, dear Isis, keep
348	decorum, and fortune him accordingly!
349	
350	CHARMIAN	Amen.
351	
352	ALEXAS	Lo, now, if it lay in their hands to make me a
353	cuckold, they would make themselves whores, but
354	they'ld do't!
355	
356	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Hush! here comes Antony.
357	
358	CHARMIAN	Not he; the queen.
359	
360	[Enter CLEOPATRA]
361	
362	CLEOPATRA	Saw you my lord?
363	
364	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  No, lady.
365	
366	CLEOPATRA	Was he not here?
367	
368	CHARMIAN	No, madam.
369	
370	CLEOPATRA	He was disposed to mirth; but on the sudden
371	A Roman thought hath struck him. Enobarbus!
372	
373	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Madam?
374	
375	CLEOPATRA	Seek him, and bring him hither.
376	Where's Alexas?
377	
378	ALEXAS	Here, at your service. My lord approaches.
379	
380	CLEOPATRA	We will not look upon him: go with us.
381	
382	[Exeunt]
383	
384	[Enter MARK ANTONY with a Messenger and Attendants]
385	
386	Messenger	Fulvia thy wife first came into the field.
387	
388	MARK ANTONY	Against my brother Lucius?
389	
390	Messenger	Ay:
391	But soon that war had end, and the time's state
392	Made friends of them, joining their force 'gainst Caesar;
393	Whose better issue in the war, from Italy,
394	Upon the first encounter, drave them.
395	
396	MARK ANTONY	Well, what worst?
397	
398	Messenger	The nature of bad news infects the teller.
399	
400	MARK ANTONY	When it concerns the fool or coward. On:
401	Things that are past are done with me. 'Tis thus:
402	Who tells me true, though in his tale lie death,
403	I hear him as he flatter'd.
404	
405	Messenger	Labienus--
406	This is stiff news--hath, with his Parthian force,
407	Extended Asia from Euphrates;
408	His conquering banner shook from Syria
409	To Lydia and to Ionia; Whilst--
410	
411	MARK ANTONY	Antony, thou wouldst say,--
412	
413	Messenger	O, my lord!
414	
415	MARK ANTONY	Speak to me home, mince not the general tongue:
416	Name Cleopatra as she is call'd in Rome;
417	Rail thou in Fulvia's phrase; and taunt my faults
418	With such full licence as both truth and malice
419	Have power to utter. O, then we bring forth weeds,
420	When our quick minds lie still; and our ills told us
421	Is as our earing. Fare thee well awhile.
422	
423	Messenger	At your noble pleasure.
424	
425	[Exit]
426	
427	MARK ANTONY	From Sicyon, ho, the news! Speak there!
428	
429	First Attendant	The man from Sicyon,--is there such an one?
430	
431	Second Attendant	He stays upon your will.
432	
433	MARK ANTONY	Let him appear.
434	These strong Egyptian fetters I must break,
435	Or lose myself in dotage.
436	
437	[Enter another Messenger]
438	
439	What are you?
440	
441	Second Messenger	Fulvia thy wife is dead.
442	
443	MARK ANTONY	Where died she?
444	
445	Second Messenger	In Sicyon:
446	Her length of sickness, with what else more serious
447	Importeth thee to know, this bears.
448	
449	[Gives a letter]
450	
451	MARK ANTONY	Forbear me.
452	
453	[Exit Second Messenger]
454	
455	There's a great spirit gone! Thus did I desire it:
456	What our contempt doth often hurl from us,
457	We wish it ours again; the present pleasure,
458	By revolution lowering, does become
459	The opposite of itself: she's good, being gone;
460	The hand could pluck her back that shoved her on.
461	I must from this enchanting queen break off:
462	Ten thousand harms, more than the ills I know,
463	My idleness doth hatch. How now! Enobarbus!
464	
465	[Re-enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
466	
467	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What's your pleasure, sir?
468	
469	MARK ANTONY	I must with haste from hence.
470	
471	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Why, then, we kill all our women:
472	we see how mortal an unkindness is to them;
473	if they suffer our departure, death's the word.
474	
475	MARK ANTONY	I must be gone.
476	
477	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Under a compelling occasion, let women die; it were
478	pity to cast them away for nothing; though, between
479	them and a great cause, they should be esteemed
480	nothing. Cleopatra, catching but the least noise of
481	this, dies instantly; I have seen her die twenty
482	times upon far poorer moment: I do think there is
483	mettle in death, which commits some loving act upon
484	her, she hath such a celerity in dying.
485	
486	MARK ANTONY	She is cunning past man's thought.
487	
488	[Exit ALEXAS]
489	
490	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Alack, sir, no; her passions are made of nothing but
491	the finest part of pure love: we cannot call her
492	winds and waters sighs and tears; they are greater
493	storms and tempests than almanacs can report: this
494	cannot be cunning in her; if it be, she makes a
495	shower of rain as well as Jove.
496	
497	MARK ANTONY	Would I had never seen her.
498	
499	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	O, sir, you had then left unseen a wonderful piece
500	of work; which not to have been blest withal would
501	have discredited your travel.
502	
503	MARK ANTONY	Fulvia is dead.
504	
505	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Sir?
506	
507	MARK ANTONY	Fulvia is dead.
508	
509	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Fulvia!
510	
511	MARK ANTONY	Dead.
512	
513	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Why, sir, give the gods a thankful sacrifice. When
514	it pleaseth their deities to take the wife of a man
515	from him, it shows to man the tailors of the earth;
516	comforting therein, that when old robes are worn
517	out, there are members to make new. If there were
518	no more women but Fulvia, then had you indeed a cut,
519	and the case to be lamented: this grief is crowned
520	with consolation; your old smock brings forth a new
521	petticoat: and indeed the tears live in an onion
522	that should water this sorrow.
523	
524	MARK ANTONY	The business she hath broached in the state
525	Cannot endure my absence.
526	
527	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	And the business you have broached here cannot be
528	without you; especially that of Cleopatra's, which
529	wholly depends on your abode.
530	
531	MARK ANTONY	No more light answers. Let our officers
532	Have notice what we purpose. I shall break
533	The cause of our expedience to the queen,
534	And get her leave to part. For not alone
535	The death of Fulvia, with more urgent touches,
536	Do strongly speak to us; but the letters too
537	Of many our contriving friends in Rome
538	Petition us at home: Sextus Pompeius
539	Hath given the dare to Caesar, and commands
540	The empire of the sea: our slippery people,
541	Whose love is never link'd to the deserver
542	Till his deserts are past, begin to throw
543	Pompey the Great and all his dignities
544	Upon his son; who, high in name and power,
545	Higher than both in blood and life, stands up
546	For the main soldier: whose quality, going on,
547	The sides o' the world may danger: much is breeding,
548	Which, like the courser's hair, hath yet but life,
549	And not a serpent's poison. Say, our pleasure,
550	To such whose place is under us, requires
551	Our quick remove from hence.
552	
553	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I shall do't.
554

564	
565	
566	
567	SCENE III	The same. Another room.
568	
569	
570	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
571	
572	CLEOPATRA	Where is he?
573	
574	CHARMIAN	                  I did not see him since.
575	
576	CLEOPATRA	See where he is, who's with him, what he does:
577	I did not send you: if you find him sad,
578	Say I am dancing; if in mirth, report
579	That I am sudden sick: quick, and return.
580	
581	[Exit ALEXAS]
582	
583	CHARMIAN	Madam, methinks, if you did love him dearly,
584	You do not hold the method to enforce
585	The like from him.
586	
587	CLEOPATRA	                  What should I do, I do not?
588	
589	CHARMIAN	In each thing give him way, cross him nothing.
590	
591	CLEOPATRA	Thou teachest like a fool; the way to lose him.
592	
593	CHARMIAN	Tempt him not so too far; I wish, forbear:
594	In time we hate that which we often fear.
595	But here comes Antony.
596	
597	[Enter MARK ANTONY]
598	
599	CLEOPATRA	I am sick and sullen.
600	
601	MARK ANTONY	I am sorry to give breathing to my purpose,--
602	
603	CLEOPATRA	Help me away, dear Charmian; I shall fall:
604	It cannot be thus long, the sides of nature
605	Will not sustain it.
606	
607	MARK ANTONY	Now, my dearest queen,--
608	
609	CLEOPATRA	Pray you, stand further from me.
610	
611	MARK ANTONY	What's the matter?
612	
613	CLEOPATRA	I know, by that same eye, there's some good news.
614	What says the married woman? You may go:
615	Would she had never given you leave to come!
616	Let her not say 'tis I that keep you here:
617	I have no power upon you; hers you are.
618	
619	MARK ANTONY	The gods best know,--
620	
621	CLEOPATRA	O, never was there queen
622	So mightily betray'd! yet at the first
623	I saw the treasons planted.
624	
625	MARK ANTONY	Cleopatra,--
626	
627	CLEOPATRA	Why should I think you can be mine and true,
628	Though you in swearing shake the throned gods,
629	Who have been false to Fulvia? Riotous madness,
630	To be entangled with those mouth-made vows,
631	Which break themselves in swearing!
632	
633	MARK ANTONY	Most sweet queen,--
634	
635	CLEOPATRA	Nay, pray you, seek no colour for your going,
636	But bid farewell, and go: when you sued staying,
637	Then was the time for words: no going then;
638	Eternity was in our lips and eyes,
639	Bliss in our brows' bent; none our parts so poor,
640	But was a race of heaven: they are so still,
641	Or thou, the greatest soldier of the world,
642	Art turn'd the greatest liar.
643	
644	MARK ANTONY	How now, lady!
645	
646	CLEOPATRA	I would I had thy inches; thou shouldst know
647	There were a heart in Egypt.
648	
649	MARK ANTONY	Hear me, queen:
650	The strong necessity of time commands
651	Our services awhile; but my full heart
652	Remains in use with you. Our Italy
653	Shines o'er with civil swords: Sextus Pompeius
654	Makes his approaches to the port of Rome:
655	Equality of two domestic powers
656	Breed scrupulous faction: the hated, grown to strength,
657	Are newly grown to love: the condemn'd Pompey,
658	Rich in his father's honour, creeps apace,
659	Into the hearts of such as have not thrived
660	Upon the present state, whose numbers threaten;
661	And quietness, grown sick of rest, would purge
662	By any desperate change: my more particular,
663	And that which most with you should safe my going,
664	Is Fulvia's death.
665	
666	CLEOPATRA	Though age from folly could not give me freedom,
667	It does from childishness: can Fulvia die?
668	
669	MARK ANTONY	She's dead, my queen:
670	Look here, and at thy sovereign leisure read
671	The garboils she awaked; at the last, best:
672	See when and where she died.
673	
674	CLEOPATRA	O most false love!
675	Where be the sacred vials thou shouldst fill
676	With sorrowful water? Now I see, I see,
677	In Fulvia's death, how mine received shall be.
678	
679	MARK ANTONY	Quarrel no more, but be prepared to know
680	The purposes I bear; which are, or cease,
681	As you shall give the advice. By the fire
682	That quickens Nilus' slime, I go from hence
683	Thy soldier, servant; making peace or war
684	As thou affect'st.
685	
686	CLEOPATRA	                  Cut my lace, Charmian, come;
687	But let it be: I am quickly ill, and well,
688	So Antony loves.
689	
690	MARK ANTONY	                  My precious queen, forbear;
691	And give true evidence to his love, which stands
692	An honourable trial.
693	
694	CLEOPATRA	So Fulvia told me.
695	I prithee, turn aside and weep for her,
696	Then bid adieu to me, and say the tears
697	Belong to Egypt: good now, play one scene
698	Of excellent dissembling; and let it look
699	Life perfect honour.
700	
701	MARK ANTONY	You'll heat my blood: no more.
702	
703	CLEOPATRA	You can do better yet; but this is meetly.
704	
705	MARK ANTONY	Now, by my sword,--
706	
707	CLEOPATRA	And target. Still he mends;
708	But this is not the best. Look, prithee, Charmian,
709	How this Herculean Roman does become
710	The carriage of his chafe.
711	
712	MARK ANTONY	I'll leave you, lady.
713	
714	CLEOPATRA	Courteous lord, one word.
715	Sir, you and I must part, but that's not it:
716	Sir, you and I have loved, but there's not it;
717	That you know well: something it is I would,
718	O, my oblivion is a very Antony,
719	And I am all forgotten.
720	
721	MARK ANTONY	But that your royalty
722	Holds idleness your subject, I should take you
723	For idleness itself.
724	
725	CLEOPATRA	'Tis sweating labour
726	To bear such idleness so near the heart
727	As Cleopatra this. But, sir, forgive me;
728	Since my becomings kill me, when they do not
729	Eye well to you: your honour calls you hence;
730	Therefore be deaf to my unpitied folly.
731	And all the gods go with you! upon your sword
732	Sit laurel victory! and smooth success
733	Be strew'd before your feet!
734	
735	MARK ANTONY	Let us go. Come;
736	Our separation so abides, and flies,
737	That thou, residing here, go'st yet with me,
738	And I, hence fleeting, here remain with thee. Away!
739	
740	[Exeunt]
741

744	
745	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
746	
747	
748	ACT I
749	
750	
751	
752	SCENE IV	Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
753	
754	
755	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, reading a letter, LEPIDUS,
756	and their Train]
757	
758	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You may see, Lepidus, and henceforth know,
759	It is not Caesar's natural vice to hate
760	Our great competitor: from Alexandria
761	This is the news: he fishes, drinks, and wastes
762	The lamps of night in revel; is not more man-like
763	Than Cleopatra; nor the queen of Ptolemy
764	More womanly than he; hardly gave audience, or
765	Vouchsafed to think he had partners: you shall find there
766	A man who is the abstract of all faults
767	That all men follow.
768	
769	LEPIDUS	I must not think there are
770	Evils enow to darken all his goodness:
771	His faults in him seem as the spots of heaven,
772	More fiery by night's blackness; hereditary,
773	Rather than purchased; what he cannot change,
774	Than what he chooses.
775	
776	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You are too indulgent. Let us grant, it is not
777	Amiss to tumble on the bed of Ptolemy;
778	To give a kingdom for a mirth; to sit
779	And keep the turn of tippling with a slave;
780	To reel the streets at noon, and stand the buffet
781	With knaves that smell of sweat: say this
782	becomes him,--
783	As his composure must be rare indeed
784	Whom these things cannot blemish,--yet must Antony
785	No way excuse his soils, when we do bear
786	So great weight in his lightness. If he fill'd
787	His vacancy with his voluptuousness,
788	Full surfeits, and the dryness of his bones,
789	Call on him for't: but to confound such time,
790	That drums him from his sport, and speaks as loud
791	As his own state and ours,--'tis to be chid
792	As we rate boys, who, being mature in knowledge,
793	Pawn their experience to their present pleasure,
794	And so rebel to judgment.
795	
796	[Enter a Messenger]
797	
798	LEPIDUS	Here's more news.
799	
800	Messenger	Thy biddings have been done; and every hour,
801	Most noble Caesar, shalt thou have report
802	How 'tis abroad. Pompey is strong at sea;
803	And it appears he is beloved of those
804	That only have fear'd Caesar: to the ports
805	The discontents repair, and men's reports
806	Give him much wrong'd.
807	
808	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I should have known no less.
809	It hath been taught us from the primal state,
810	That he which is was wish'd until he were;
811	And the ebb'd man, ne'er loved till ne'er worth love,
812	Comes dear'd by being lack'd. This common body,
813	Like to a vagabond flag upon the stream,
814	Goes to and back, lackeying the varying tide,
815	To rot itself with motion.
816	
817	Messenger	Caesar, I bring thee word,
818	Menecrates and Menas, famous pirates,
819	Make the sea serve them, which they ear and wound
820	With keels of every kind: many hot inroads
821	They make in Italy; the borders maritime
822	Lack blood to think on't, and flush youth revolt:
823	No vessel can peep forth, but 'tis as soon
824	Taken as seen; for Pompey's name strikes more
825	Than could his war resisted.
826	
827	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Antony,
828	Leave thy lascivious wassails. When thou once
829	Wast beaten from Modena, where thou slew'st
830	Hirtius and Pansa, consuls, at thy heel
831	Did famine follow; whom thou fought'st against,
832	Though daintily brought up, with patience more
833	Than savages could suffer: thou didst drink
834	The stale of horses, and the gilded puddle
835	Which beasts would cough at: thy palate then did deign
836	The roughest berry on the rudest hedge;
837	Yea, like the stag, when snow the pasture sheets,
838	The barks of trees thou browsed'st; on the Alps
839	It is reported thou didst eat strange flesh,
840	Which some did die to look on: and all this--
841	It wounds thine honour that I speak it now--
842	Was borne so like a soldier, that thy cheek
843	So much as lank'd not.
844	
845	LEPIDUS	'Tis pity of him.
846	
847	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let his shames quickly
848	Drive him to Rome: 'tis time we twain
849	Did show ourselves i' the field; and to that end
850	Assemble we immediate council: Pompey
851	Thrives in our idleness.
852	
853	LEPIDUS	To-morrow, Caesar,
854	I shall be furnish'd to inform you rightly
855	Both what by sea and land I can be able
856	To front this present time.
857	
858	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Till which encounter,
859	It is my business too. Farewell.
860	
861	LEPIDUS	Farewell, my lord: what you shall know meantime
862	Of stirs abroad, I shall beseech you, sir,
863	To let me be partaker.
864	
865	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Doubt not, sir;
866	I knew it for my bond.
867

876	ACT I
877	
878	
879	
880	SCENE V	Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
881	
882	
883	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and MARDIAN]
884	
885	CLEOPATRA	Charmian!
886	
887	CHARMIAN	Madam?
888	
889	CLEOPATRA	Ha, ha!
890	Give me to drink mandragora.
891	
892	CHARMIAN	Why, madam?
893	
894	CLEOPATRA	That I might sleep out this great gap of time
895	My Antony is away.
896	
897	CHARMIAN	                  You think of him too much.
898	
899	CLEOPATRA	O, 'tis treason!
900	
901	CHARMIAN	                  Madam, I trust, not so.
902	
903	CLEOPATRA	Thou, eunuch Mardian!
904	
905	MARDIAN	What's your highness' pleasure?
906	
907	CLEOPATRA	Not now to hear thee sing; I take no pleasure
908	In aught an eunuch has: 'tis well for thee,
909	That, being unseminar'd, thy freer thoughts
910	May not fly forth of Egypt. Hast thou affections?
911	
912	MARDIAN	Yes, gracious madam.
913	
914	CLEOPATRA	Indeed!
915	
916	MARDIAN	Not in deed, madam; for I can do nothing
917	But what indeed is honest to be done:
918	Yet have I fierce affections, and think
919	What Venus did with Mars.
920	
921	CLEOPATRA	O Charmian,
922	Where think'st thou he is now? Stands he, or sits he?
923	Or does he walk? or is he on his horse?
924	O happy horse, to bear the weight of Antony!
925	Do bravely, horse! for wot'st thou whom thou movest?
926	The demi-Atlas of this earth, the arm
927	And burgonet of men. He's speaking now,
928	Or murmuring 'Where's my serpent of old Nile?'
929	For so he calls me: now I feed myself
930	With most delicious poison. Think on me,
931	That am with Phoebus' amorous pinches black,
932	And wrinkled deep in time? Broad-fronted Caesar,
933	When thou wast here above the ground, I was
934	A morsel for a monarch: and great Pompey
935	Would stand and make his eyes grow in my brow;
936	There would he anchor his aspect and die
937	With looking on his life.
938	
939	[Enter ALEXAS, from OCTAVIUS CAESAR]
940	
941	ALEXAS	Sovereign of Egypt, hail!
942	
943	CLEOPATRA	How much unlike art thou Mark Antony!
944	Yet, coming from him, that great medicine hath
945	With his tinct gilded thee.
946	How goes it with my brave Mark Antony?
947	
948	ALEXAS	Last thing he did, dear queen,
949	He kiss'd,--the last of many doubled kisses,--
950	This orient pearl. His speech sticks in my heart.
951	
952	CLEOPATRA	Mine ear must pluck it thence.
953	
954	ALEXAS	'Good friend,' quoth he,
955	'Say, the firm Roman to great Egypt sends
956	This treasure of an oyster; at whose foot,
957	To mend the petty present, I will piece
958	Her opulent throne with kingdoms; all the east,
959	Say thou, shall call her mistress.' So he nodded,
960	And soberly did mount an arm-gaunt steed,
961	Who neigh'd so high, that what I would have spoke
962	Was beastly dumb'd by him.
963	
964	CLEOPATRA	What, was he sad or merry?
965	
966	ALEXAS	Like to the time o' the year between the extremes
967	Of hot and cold, he was nor sad nor merry.
968	
969	CLEOPATRA	O well-divided disposition! Note him,
970	Note him good Charmian, 'tis the man; but note him:
971	He was not sad, for he would shine on those
972	That make their looks by his; he was not merry,
973	Which seem'd to tell them his remembrance lay
974	In Egypt with his joy; but between both:
975	O heavenly mingle! Be'st thou sad or merry,
976	The violence of either thee becomes,
977	So does it no man else. Met'st thou my posts?
978	
979	ALEXAS	Ay, madam, twenty several messengers:
980	Why do you send so thick?
981	
982	CLEOPATRA	Who's born that day
983	When I forget to send to Antony,
984	Shall die a beggar. Ink and paper, Charmian.
985	Welcome, my good Alexas. Did I, Charmian,
986	Ever love Caesar so?
987	
988	CHARMIAN	O that brave Caesar!
989	
990	CLEOPATRA	Be choked with such another emphasis!
991	Say, the brave Antony.
992	
993	CHARMIAN	The valiant Caesar!
994	
995	CLEOPATRA	By Isis, I will give thee bloody teeth,
996	If thou with Caesar paragon again
997	My man of men.
998	
999	CHARMIAN	                  By your most gracious pardon,
1000	I sing but after you.
1001	
1002	CLEOPATRA	My salad days,
1003	When I was green in judgment: cold in blood,
1004	To say as I said then! But, come, away;
1005	Get me ink and paper:
1006	He shall have every day a several greeting,
1007	Or I'll unpeople Egypt.
1008

1019	
1020	
1021	SCENE I	Messina. POMPEY's house.
1022	
1023	
1024	[Enter POMPEY, MENECRATES, and MENAS, in
1025	warlike manner]
1026	
1027	POMPEY	If the great gods be just, they shall assist
1028	The deeds of justest men.
1029	
1030	MENECRATES	Know, worthy Pompey,
1031	That what they do delay, they not deny.
1032	
1033	POMPEY	Whiles we are suitors to their throne, decays
1034	The thing we sue for.
1035	
1036	MENECRATES	We, ignorant of ourselves,
1037	Beg often our own harms, which the wise powers
1038	Deny us for our good; so find we profit
1039	By losing of our prayers.
1040	
1041	POMPEY	I shall do well:
1042	The people love me, and the sea is mine;
1043	My powers are crescent, and my auguring hope
1044	Says it will come to the full. Mark Antony
1045	In Egypt sits at dinner, and will make
1046	No wars without doors: Caesar gets money where
1047	He loses hearts: Lepidus flatters both,
1048	Of both is flatter'd; but he neither loves,
1049	Nor either cares for him.
1050	
1051	MENAS	Caesar and Lepidus
1052	Are in the field: a mighty strength they carry.
1053	
1054	POMPEY	Where have you this? 'tis false.
1055	
1056	MENAS	From Silvius, sir.
1057	
1058	POMPEY	He dreams: I know they are in Rome together,
1059	Looking for Antony. But all the charms of love,
1060	Salt Cleopatra, soften thy waned lip!
1061	Let witchcraft join with beauty, lust with both!
1062	Tie up the libertine in a field of feasts,
1063	Keep his brain fuming; Epicurean cooks
1064	Sharpen with cloyless sauce his appetite;
1065	That sleep and feeding may prorogue his honour
1066	Even till a Lethe'd dulness!
1067	
1068	[Enter VARRIUS]
1069	
1070	How now, Varrius!
1071	
1072	VARRIUS	This is most certain that I shall deliver:
1073	Mark Antony is every hour in Rome
1074	Expected: since he went from Egypt 'tis
1075	A space for further travel.
1076	
1077	POMPEY	I could have given less matter
1078	A better ear. Menas, I did not think
1079	This amorous surfeiter would have donn'd his helm
1080	For such a petty war: his soldiership
1081	Is twice the other twain: but let us rear
1082	The higher our opinion, that our stirring
1083	Can from the lap of Egypt's widow pluck
1084	The ne'er-lust-wearied Antony.
1085	
1086	MENAS	I cannot hope
1087	Caesar and Antony shall well greet together:
1088	His wife that's dead did trespasses to Caesar;
1089	His brother warr'd upon him; although, I think,
1090	Not moved by Antony.
1091	
1092	POMPEY	I know not, Menas,
1093	How lesser enmities may give way to greater.
1094	Were't not that we stand up against them all,
1095	'Twere pregnant they should square between
1096	themselves;
1097	For they have entertained cause enough
1098	To draw their swords: but how the fear of us
1099	May cement their divisions and bind up
1100	The petty difference, we yet not know.
1101	Be't as our gods will have't! It only stands
1102	Our lives upon to use our strongest hands.
1103	Come, Menas.

1118	
1119	
1120	[Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and LEPIDUS]
1121	
1122	LEPIDUS	Good Enobarbus, 'tis a worthy deed,
1123	And shall become you well, to entreat your captain
1124	To soft and gentle speech.
1125	
1126	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I shall entreat him
1127	To answer like himself: if Caesar move him,
1128	Let Antony look over Caesar's head
1129	And speak as loud as Mars. By Jupiter,
1130	Were I the wearer of Antonius' beard,
1131	I would not shave't to-day.
1132	
1133	LEPIDUS	'Tis not a time
1134	For private stomaching.
1135	
1136	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Every time
1137	Serves for the matter that is then born in't.
1138	
1139	LEPIDUS	But small to greater matters must give way.
1140	
1141	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Not if the small come first.
1142	
1143	LEPIDUS	Your speech is passion:
1144	But, pray you, stir no embers up. Here comes
1145	The noble Antony.
1146	
1147	[Enter MARK ANTONY and VENTIDIUS]
1148	
1149	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  And yonder, Caesar.
1150	
1151	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MECAENAS, and AGRIPPA]
1152	
1153	MARK ANTONY	If we compose well here, to Parthia:
1154	Hark, Ventidius.
1155	
1156	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  I do not know,
1157	Mecaenas; ask Agrippa.
1158	
1159	LEPIDUS	Noble friends,
1160	That which combined us was most great, and let not
1161	A leaner action rend us. What's amiss,
1162	May it be gently heard: when we debate
1163	Our trivial difference loud, we do commit
1164	Murder in healing wounds: then, noble partners,
1165	The rather, for I earnestly beseech,
1166	Touch you the sourest points with sweetest terms,
1167	Nor curstness grow to the matter.
1168	
1169	MARK ANTONY	'Tis spoken well.
1170	Were we before our armies, and to fight.
1171	I should do thus.
1172	
1173	[Flourish]
1174	
1175	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Welcome to Rome.
1176	
1177	MARK ANTONY	                  Thank you.
1178	
1179	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Sit.
1180	
1181	MARK ANTONY	Sit, sir.
1182	
1183	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Nay, then.
1184	
1185	MARK ANTONY	I learn, you take things ill which are not so,
1186	Or being, concern you not.
1187	
1188	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I must be laugh'd at,
1189	If, or for nothing or a little, I
1190	Should say myself offended, and with you
1191	Chiefly i' the world; more laugh'd at, that I should
1192	Once name you derogately, when to sound your name
1193	It not concern'd me.
1194	
1195	MARK ANTONY	My being in Egypt, Caesar,
1196	What was't to you?
1197	
1198	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	No more than my residing here at Rome
1199	Might be to you in Egypt: yet, if you there
1200	Did practise on my state, your being in Egypt
1201	Might be my question.
1202	
1203	MARK ANTONY	How intend you, practised?
1204	
1205	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You may be pleased to catch at mine intent
1206	By what did here befal me. Your wife and brother
1207	Made wars upon me; and their contestation
1208	Was theme for you, you were the word of war.
1209	
1210	MARK ANTONY	You do mistake your business; my brother never
1211	Did urge me in his act: I did inquire it;
1212	And have my learning from some true reports,
1213	That drew their swords with you. Did he not rather
1214	Discredit my authority with yours;
1215	And make the wars alike against my stomach,
1216	Having alike your cause? Of this my letters
1217	Before did satisfy you. If you'll patch a quarrel,
1218	As matter whole you have not to make it with,
1219	It must not be with this.
1220	
1221	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You praise yourself
1222	By laying defects of judgment to me; but
1223	You patch'd up your excuses.
1224	
1225	MARK ANTONY	Not so, not so;
1226	I know you could not lack, I am certain on't,
1227	Very necessity of this thought, that I,
1228	Your partner in the cause 'gainst which he fought,
1229	Could not with graceful eyes attend those wars
1230	Which fronted mine own peace. As for my wife,
1231	I would you had her spirit in such another:
1232	The third o' the world is yours; which with a snaffle
1233	You may pace easy, but not such a wife.
1234	
1235	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Would we had all such wives, that the men might go
1236	to wars with the women!
1237	
1238	MARK ANTONY	So much uncurbable, her garboils, Caesar
1239	Made out of her impatience, which not wanted
1240	Shrewdness of policy too, I grieving grant
1241	Did you too much disquiet: for that you must
1242	But say, I could not help it.
1243	
1244	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I wrote to you
1245	When rioting in Alexandria; you
1246	Did pocket up my letters, and with taunts
1247	Did gibe my missive out of audience.
1248	
1249	MARK ANTONY	Sir,
1250	He fell upon me ere admitted: then
1251	Three kings I had newly feasted, and did want
1252	Of what I was i' the morning: but next day
1253	I told him of myself; which was as much
1254	As to have ask'd him pardon. Let this fellow
1255	Be nothing of our strife; if we contend,
1256	Out of our question wipe him.
1257	
1258	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You have broken
1259	The article of your oath; which you shall never
1260	Have tongue to charge me with.
1261	
1262	LEPIDUS	Soft, Caesar!
1263	
1264	MARK ANTONY	No,
1265	Lepidus, let him speak:
1266	The honour is sacred which he talks on now,
1267	Supposing that I lack'd it. But, on, Caesar;
1268	The article of my oath.
1269	
1270	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	To lend me arms and aid when I required them;
1271	The which you both denied.
1272	
1273	MARK ANTONY	Neglected, rather;
1274	And then when poison'd hours had bound me up
1275	From mine own knowledge. As nearly as I may,
1276	I'll play the penitent to you: but mine honesty
1277	Shall not make poor my greatness, nor my power
1278	Work without it. Truth is, that Fulvia,
1279	To have me out of Egypt, made wars here;
1280	For which myself, the ignorant motive, do
1281	So far ask pardon as befits mine honour
1282	To stoop in such a case.
1283	
1284	LEPIDUS	'Tis noble spoken.
1285	
1286	MECAENAS	If it might please you, to enforce no further
1287	The griefs between ye: to forget them quite
1288	Were to remember that the present need
1289	Speaks to atone you.
1290	
1291	LEPIDUS	Worthily spoken, Mecaenas.
1292	
1293	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Or, if you borrow one another's love for the
1294	instant, you may, when you hear no more words of
1295	Pompey, return it again: you shall have time to
1296	wrangle in when you have nothing else to do.
1297	
1298	MARK ANTONY	Thou art a soldier only: speak no more.
1299	
1300	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	That truth should be silent I had almost forgot.
1301	
1302	MARK ANTONY	You wrong this presence; therefore speak no more.
1303	
1304	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Go to, then; your considerate stone.
1305	
1306	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I do not much dislike the matter, but
1307	The manner of his speech; for't cannot be
1308	We shall remain in friendship, our conditions
1309	So differing in their acts. Yet if I knew
1310	What hoop should hold us stanch, from edge to edge
1311	O' the world I would pursue it.
1312	
1313	AGRIPPA	Give me leave, Caesar,--
1314	
1315	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Speak, Agrippa.
1316	
1317	AGRIPPA	Thou hast a sister by the mother's side,
1318	Admired Octavia: great Mark Antony
1319	Is now a widower.
1320	
1321	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Say not so, Agrippa:
1322	If Cleopatra heard you, your reproof
1323	Were well deserved of rashness.
1324	
1325	MARK ANTONY	I am not married, Caesar: let me hear
1326	Agrippa further speak.
1327	
1328	AGRIPPA	To hold you in perpetual amity,
1329	To make you brothers, and to knit your hearts
1330	With an unslipping knot, take Antony
1331	Octavia to his wife; whose beauty claims
1332	No worse a husband than the best of men;
1333	Whose virtue and whose general graces speak
1334	That which none else can utter. By this marriage,
1335	All little jealousies, which now seem great,
1336	And all great fears, which now import their dangers,
1337	Would then be nothing: truths would be tales,
1338	Where now half tales be truths: her love to both
1339	Would, each to other and all loves to both,
1340	Draw after her. Pardon what I have spoke;
1341	For 'tis a studied, not a present thought,
1342	By duty ruminated.
1343	
1344	MARK ANTONY	                  Will Caesar speak?
1345	
1346	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Not till he hears how Antony is touch'd
1347	With what is spoke already.
1348	
1349	MARK ANTONY	What power is in Agrippa,
1350	If I would say, 'Agrippa, be it so,'
1351	To make this good?
1352	
1353	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  The power of Caesar, and
1354	His power unto Octavia.
1355	
1356	MARK ANTONY	May I never
1357	To this good purpose, that so fairly shows,
1358	Dream of impediment! Let me have thy hand:
1359	Further this act of grace: and from this hour
1360	The heart of brothers govern in our loves
1361	And sway our great designs!
1362	
1363	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	There is my hand.
1364	A sister I bequeath you, whom no brother
1365	Did ever love so dearly: let her live
1366	To join our kingdoms and our hearts; and never
1367	Fly off our loves again!
1368	
1369	LEPIDUS	Happily, amen!
1370	
1371	MARK ANTONY	I did not think to draw my sword 'gainst Pompey;
1372	For he hath laid strange courtesies and great
1373	Of late upon me: I must thank him only,
1374	Lest my remembrance suffer ill report;
1375	At heel of that, defy him.
1376	
1377	LEPIDUS	Time calls upon's:
1378	Of us must Pompey presently be sought,
1379	Or else he seeks out us.
1380	
1381	MARK ANTONY	Where lies he?
1382	
1383	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	About the mount Misenum.
1384	
1385	MARK ANTONY	What is his strength by land?
1386	
1387	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Great and increasing: but by sea
1388	He is an absolute master.
1389	
1390	MARK ANTONY	So is the fame.
1391	Would we had spoke together! Haste we for it:
1392	Yet, ere we put ourselves in arms, dispatch we
1393	The business we have talk'd of.
1394	
1395	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	With most gladness:
1396	And do invite you to my sister's view,
1397	Whither straight I'll lead you.
1398	
1399	MARK ANTONY	Let us, Lepidus,
1400	Not lack your company.
1401	
1402	LEPIDUS	Noble Antony,
1403	Not sickness should detain me.
1404	
1405	[Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY,
1406	and LEPIDUS]
1407	
1408	MECAENAS	Welcome from Egypt, sir.
1409	
1410	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Half the heart of Caesar, worthy Mecaenas! My
1411	honourable friend, Agrippa!
1412	
1413	AGRIPPA	Good Enobarbus!
1414	
1415	MECAENAS	We have cause to be glad that matters are so well
1416	digested. You stayed well by 't in Egypt.
1417	
1418	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ay, sir; we did sleep day out of countenance, and
1419	made the night light with drinking.
1420	
1421	MECAENAS	Eight wild-boars roasted whole at a breakfast, and
1422	but twelve persons there; is this true?
1423	
1424	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	This was but as a fly by an eagle: we had much more
1425	monstrous matter of feast, which worthily deserved noting.
1426	
1427	MECAENAS	She's a most triumphant lady, if report be square to
1428	her.
1429	
1430	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	When she first met Mark Antony, she pursed up
1431	his heart, upon the river of Cydnus.
1432	
1433	AGRIPPA	There she appeared indeed; or my reporter devised
1434	well for her.
1435	
1436	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I will tell you.
1437	The barge she sat in, like a burnish'd throne,
1438	Burn'd on the water: the poop was beaten gold;
1439	Purple the sails, and so perfumed that
1440	The winds were love-sick with them; the oars were silver,
1441	Which to the tune of flutes kept stroke, and made
1442	The water which they beat to follow faster,
1443	As amorous of their strokes. For her own person,
1444	It beggar'd all description: she did lie
1445	In her pavilion--cloth-of-gold of tissue--
1446	O'er-picturing that Venus where we see
1447	The fancy outwork nature: on each side her
1448	Stood pretty dimpled boys, like smiling Cupids,
1449	With divers-colour'd fans, whose wind did seem
1450	To glow the delicate cheeks which they did cool,
1451	And what they undid did.
1452	
1453	AGRIPPA	O, rare for Antony!
1454	
1455	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Her gentlewomen, like the Nereides,
1456	So many mermaids, tended her i' the eyes,
1457	And made their bends adornings: at the helm
1458	A seeming mermaid steers: the silken tackle
1459	Swell with the touches of those flower-soft hands,
1460	That yarely frame the office. From the barge
1461	A strange invisible perfume hits the sense
1462	Of the adjacent wharfs. The city cast
1463	Her people out upon her; and Antony,
1464	Enthroned i' the market-place, did sit alone,
1465	Whistling to the air; which, but for vacancy,
1466	Had gone to gaze on Cleopatra too,
1467	And made a gap in nature.
1468	
1469	AGRIPPA	Rare Egyptian!
1470	
1471	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Upon her landing, Antony sent to her,
1472	Invited her to supper: she replied,
1473	It should be better he became her guest;
1474	Which she entreated: our courteous Antony,
1475	Whom ne'er the word of 'No' woman heard speak,
1476	Being barber'd ten times o'er, goes to the feast,
1477	And for his ordinary pays his heart
1478	For what his eyes eat only.
1479	
1480	AGRIPPA	Royal wench!
1481	She made great Caesar lay his sword to bed:
1482	He plough'd her, and she cropp'd.
1483	
1484	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I saw her once
1485	Hop forty paces through the public street;
1486	And having lost her breath, she spoke, and panted,
1487	That she did make defect perfection,
1488	And, breathless, power breathe forth.
1489	
1490	MECAENAS	Now Antony must leave her utterly.
1491	
1492	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Never; he will not:
1493	Age cannot wither her, nor custom stale
1494	Her infinite variety: other women cloy
1495	The appetites they feed: but she makes hungry
1496	Where most she satisfies; for vilest things
1497	Become themselves in her: that the holy priests
1498	Bless her when she is riggish.
1499	
1500	MECAENAS	If beauty, wisdom, modesty, can settle
1501	The heart of Antony, Octavia is
1502	A blessed lottery to him.
1503	
1504	AGRIPPA	Let us go.
1505	Good Enobarbus, make yourself my guest
1506	Whilst you abide here.
1507	
1508	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Humbly, sir, I thank you.

1525	[Enter MARK ANTONY, OCTAVIUS CAESAR, OCTAVIA between
1526	them, and Attendants]
1527	
1528	MARK ANTONY	The world and my great office will sometimes
1529	Divide me from your bosom.
1530	
1531	OCTAVIA	All which time
1532	Before the gods my knee shall bow my prayers
1533	To them for you.
1534	
1535	MARK ANTONY	                  Good night, sir. My Octavia,
1536	Read not my blemishes in the world's report:
1537	I have not kept my square; but that to come
1538	Shall all be done by the rule. Good night, dear lady.
1539	Good night, sir.
1540	
1541	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Good night.
1542	
1543	[Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and OCTAVIA]
1544	
1545	[Enter Soothsayer]
1546	
1547	MARK ANTONY	Now, sirrah; you do wish yourself in Egypt?
1548	
1549	Soothsayer	Would I had never come from thence, nor you Thither!
1550	
1551	MARK ANTONY	If you can, your reason?
1552	
1553	Soothsayer	I see it in
1554	My motion, have it not in my tongue: but yet
1555	Hie you to Egypt again.
1556	
1557	MARK ANTONY	Say to me,
1558	Whose fortunes shall rise higher, Caesar's or mine?
1559	
1560	Soothsayer	Caesar's.
1561	Therefore, O Antony, stay not by his side:
1562	Thy demon, that's thy spirit which keeps thee, is
1563	Noble, courageous high, unmatchable,
1564	Where Caesar's is not; but, near him, thy angel
1565	Becomes a fear, as being o'erpower'd: therefore
1566	Make space enough between you.
1567	
1568	MARK ANTONY	Speak this no more.
1569	
1570	Soothsayer	To none but thee; no more, but when to thee.
1571	If thou dost play with him at any game,
1572	Thou art sure to lose; and, of that natural luck,
1573	He beats thee 'gainst the odds: thy lustre thickens,
1574	When he shines by: I say again, thy spirit
1575	Is all afraid to govern thee near him;
1576	But, he away, 'tis noble.
1577	
1578	MARK ANTONY	Get thee gone:
1579	Say to Ventidius I would speak with him:
1580	
1581	[Exit Soothsayer]
1582	
1583	He shall to Parthia. Be it art or hap,
1584	He hath spoken true: the very dice obey him;
1585	And in our sports my better cunning faints
1586	Under his chance: if we draw lots, he speeds;
1587	His cocks do win the battle still of mine,
1588	When it is all to nought; and his quails ever
1589	Beat mine, inhoop'd, at odds. I will to Egypt:
1590	And though I make this marriage for my peace,
1591	I' the east my pleasure lies.
1592	
1593	[Enter VENTIDIUS]
1594	
1595	O, come, Ventidius,
1596	You must to Parthia: your commission's ready;

1616	LEPIDUS	Trouble yourselves no further: pray you, hasten
1617	Your generals after.
1618	
1619	AGRIPPA	Sir, Mark Antony
1620	Will e'en but kiss Octavia, and we'll follow.
1621	
1622	LEPIDUS	Till I shall see you in your soldier's dress,
1623	Which will become you both, farewell.
1624	
1625	MECAENAS	We shall,
1626	As I conceive the journey, be at the Mount
1627	Before you, Lepidus.
1628	
1629	LEPIDUS	Your way is shorter;
1630	My purposes do draw me much about:
1631	You'll win two days upon me.

1654	
1655	
1656	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
1657	
1658	CLEOPATRA	Give me some music; music, moody food
1659	Of us that trade in love.
1660	
1661	Attendants	The music, ho!
1662	
1663	[Enter MARDIAN]
1664	
1665	CLEOPATRA	Let it alone; let's to billiards: come, Charmian.
1666	
1667	CHARMIAN	My arm is sore; best play with Mardian.
1668	
1669	CLEOPATRA	As well a woman with an eunuch play'd
1670	As with a woman. Come, you'll play with me, sir?
1671	
1672	MARDIAN	As well as I can, madam.
1673	
1674	CLEOPATRA	And when good will is show'd, though't come
1675	too short,
1676	The actor may plead pardon. I'll none now:
1677	Give me mine angle; we'll to the river: there,
1678	My music playing far off, I will betray
1679	Tawny-finn'd fishes; my bended hook shall pierce
1680	Their slimy jaws; and, as I draw them up,
1681	I'll think them every one an Antony,
1682	And say 'Ah, ha! you're caught.'
1683	
1684	CHARMIAN	'Twas merry when
1685	You wager'd on your angling; when your diver
1686	Did hang a salt-fish on his hook, which he
1687	With fervency drew up.
1688	
1689	CLEOPATRA	That time,--O times!--
1690	I laugh'd him out of patience; and that night
1691	I laugh'd him into patience; and next morn,
1692	Ere the ninth hour, I drunk him to his bed;
1693	Then put my tires and mantles on him, whilst
1694	I wore his sword Philippan.
1695	
1696	[Enter a Messenger]
1697	
1698	O, from Italy
1699	Ram thou thy fruitful tidings in mine ears,
1700	That long time have been barren.
1701	
1702	Messenger	Madam, madam,--
1703	
1704	CLEOPATRA	Antonius dead!--If thou say so, villain,
1705	Thou kill'st thy mistress: but well and free,
1706	If thou so yield him, there is gold, and here
1707	My bluest veins to kiss; a hand that kings
1708	Have lipp'd, and trembled kissing.
1709	
1710	Messenger	First, madam, he is well.
1711	
1712	CLEOPATRA	Why, there's more gold.
1713	But, sirrah, mark, we use
1714	To say the dead are well: bring it to that,
1715	The gold I give thee will I melt and pour
1716	Down thy ill-uttering throat.
1717	
1718	Messenger	Good madam, hear me.
1719	
1720	CLEOPATRA	Well, go to, I will;
1721	But there's no goodness in thy face: if Antony
1722	Be free and healthful,--so tart a favour
1723	To trumpet such good tidings! If not well,
1724	Thou shouldst come like a Fury crown'd with snakes,
1725	Not like a formal man.
1726	
1727	Messenger	Will't please you hear me?
1728	
1729	CLEOPATRA	I have a mind to strike thee ere thou speak'st:
1730	Yet if thou say Antony lives, is well,
1731	Or friends with Caesar, or not captive to him,
1732	I'll set thee in a shower of gold, and hail
1733	Rich pearls upon thee.
1734	
1735	Messenger	Madam, he's well.
1736	
1737	CLEOPATRA	Well said.
1738	
1739	Messenger	And friends with Caesar.
1740	
1741	CLEOPATRA	Thou'rt an honest man.
1742	
1743	Messenger	Caesar and he are greater friends than ever.
1744	
1745	CLEOPATRA	Make thee a fortune from me.
1746	
1747	Messenger	But yet, madam,--
1748	
1749	CLEOPATRA	I do not like 'But yet,' it does allay
1750	The good precedence; fie upon 'But yet'!
1751	'But yet' is as a gaoler to bring forth
1752	Some monstrous malefactor. Prithee, friend,
1753	Pour out the pack of matter to mine ear,
1754	The good and bad together: he's friends with Caesar:
1755	In state of health thou say'st; and thou say'st free.
1756	
1757	Messenger	Free, madam! no; I made no such report:
1758	He's bound unto Octavia.
1759	
1760	CLEOPATRA	For what good turn?
1761	
1762	Messenger	For the best turn i' the bed.
1763	
1764	CLEOPATRA	I am pale, Charmian.
1765	
1766	Messenger	Madam, he's married to Octavia.
1767	
1768	CLEOPATRA	The most infectious pestilence upon thee!
1769	
1770	[Strikes him down]
1771	
1772	Messenger	Good madam, patience.
1773	
1774	CLEOPATRA	What say you? Hence,
1775	
1776	[Strikes him again]
1777	
1778	Horrible villain! or I'll spurn thine eyes
1779	Like balls before me; I'll unhair thy head:
1780	
1781	[She hales him up and down]
1782	
1783	Thou shalt be whipp'd with wire, and stew'd in brine,
1784	Smarting in lingering pickle.
1785	
1786	Messenger	Gracious madam,
1787	I that do bring the news made not the match.
1788	
1789	CLEOPATRA	Say 'tis not so, a province I will give thee,
1790	And make thy fortunes proud: the blow thou hadst
1791	Shall make thy peace for moving me to rage;
1792	And I will boot thee with what gift beside
1793	Thy modesty can beg.
1794	
1795	Messenger	He's married, madam.
1796	
1797	CLEOPATRA	Rogue, thou hast lived too long.
1798	
1799	[Draws a knife]
1800	
1801	Messenger	Nay, then I'll run.
1802	What mean you, madam? I have made no fault.
1803	
1804	[Exit]
1805	
1806	CHARMIAN	Good madam, keep yourself within yourself:
1807	The man is innocent.
1808	
1809	CLEOPATRA	Some innocents 'scape not the thunderbolt.
1810	Melt Egypt into Nile! and kindly creatures
1811	Turn all to serpents! Call the slave again:
1812	Though I am mad, I will not bite him: call.
1813	
1814	CHARMIAN	He is afeard to come.
1815	
1816	CLEOPATRA	I will not hurt him.
1817	
1818	[Exit CHARMIAN]
1819	
1820	These hands do lack nobility, that they strike
1821	A meaner than myself; since I myself
1822	Have given myself the cause.
1823	
1824	[Re-enter CHARMIAN and Messenger]
1825	
1826	Come hither, sir.
1827	Though it be honest, it is never good
1828	To bring bad news: give to a gracious message.
1829	An host of tongues; but let ill tidings tell
1830	Themselves when they be felt.
1831	
1832	Messenger	I have done my duty.
1833	
1834	CLEOPATRA	Is he married?
1835	I cannot hate thee worser than I do,
1836	If thou again say 'Yes.'
1837	
1838	Messenger	He's married, madam.
1839	
1840	CLEOPATRA	The gods confound thee! dost thou hold there still?
1841	
1842	Messenger	Should I lie, madam?
1843	
1844	CLEOPATRA	O, I would thou didst,
1845	So half my Egypt were submerged and made
1846	A cistern for scaled snakes! Go, get thee hence:
1847	Hadst thou Narcissus in thy face, to me
1848	Thou wouldst appear most ugly. He is married?
1849	
1850	Messenger	I crave your highness' pardon.
1851	
1852	CLEOPATRA	He is married?
1853	
1854	Messenger	Take no offence that I would not offend you:
1855	To punish me for what you make me do.
1856	Seems much unequal: he's married to Octavia.
1857	
1858	CLEOPATRA	O, that his fault should make a knave of thee,
1859	That art not what thou'rt sure of! Get thee hence:
1860	The merchandise which thou hast brought from Rome
1861	Are all too dear for me: lie they upon thy hand,
1862	And be undone by 'em!
1863	
1864	[Exit Messenger]
1865	
1866	CHARMIAN	Good your highness, patience.
1867	
1868	CLEOPATRA	In praising Antony, I have dispraised Caesar.
1869	
1870	CHARMIAN	Many times, madam.
1871	
1872	CLEOPATRA	                  I am paid for't now.
1873	Lead me from hence:
1874	I faint: O Iras, Charmian! 'tis no matter.
1875	Go to the fellow, good Alexas; bid him
1876	Report the feature of Octavia, her years,
1877	Her inclination, let him not leave out
1878	The colour of her hair: bring me word quickly.
1879	
1880	[Exit ALEXAS]
1881	
1882	Let him for ever go:--let him not--Charmian,
1883	Though he be painted one way like a Gorgon,
1884	The other way's a Mars. Bid you Alexas
1885	
1886	[To MARDIAN]
1887	
1888	Bring me word how tall she is. Pity me, Charmian,
1889	But do not speak to me. Lead me to my chamber.
1890	
1891	[Exeunt]

1896	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
1897	
1898	
1899	ACT II
1900	
1901	
1902	
1903	SCENE VI	Near Misenum.
1904	
1905	
1906	[Flourish. Enter POMPEY and MENAS at one door,
1907	with drum and trumpet: at another, OCTAVIUS CAESAR,
1908	MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MECAENAS,
1909	with Soldiers marching]
1910	
1911	POMPEY	Your hostages I have, so have you mine;
1912	And we shall talk before we fight.
1913	
1914	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Most meet
1915	That first we come to words; and therefore have we
1916	Our written purposes before us sent;
1917	Which, if thou hast consider'd, let us know
1918	If 'twill tie up thy discontented sword,
1919	And carry back to Sicily much tall youth
1920	That else must perish here.
1921	
1922	POMPEY	To you all three,
1923	The senators alone of this great world,
1924	Chief factors for the gods, I do not know
1925	Wherefore my father should revengers want,
1926	Having a son and friends; since Julius Caesar,
1927	Who at Philippi the good Brutus ghosted,
1928	There saw you labouring for him. What was't
1929	That moved pale Cassius to conspire; and what
1930	Made the all-honour'd, honest Roman, Brutus,
1931	With the arm'd rest, courtiers and beauteous freedom,
1932	To drench the Capitol; but that they would
1933	Have one man but a man? And that is it
1934	Hath made me rig my navy; at whose burthen
1935	The anger'd ocean foams; with which I meant
1936	To scourge the ingratitude that despiteful Rome
1937	Cast on my noble father.
1938	
1939	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Take your time.
1940	
1941	MARK ANTONY	Thou canst not fear us, Pompey, with thy sails;
1942	We'll speak with thee at sea: at land, thou know'st
1943	How much we do o'er-count thee.
1944	
1945	POMPEY	At land, indeed,
1946	Thou dost o'er-count me of my father's house:
1947	But, since the cuckoo builds not for himself,
1948	Remain in't as thou mayst.
1949	
1950	LEPIDUS	Be pleased to tell us--
1951	For this is from the present--how you take
1952	The offers we have sent you.
1953	
1954	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	There's the point.
1955	
1956	MARK ANTONY	Which do not be entreated to, but weigh
1957	What it is worth embraced.
1958	
1959	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	And what may follow,
1960	To try a larger fortune.
1961	
1962	POMPEY	You have made me offer
1963	Of Sicily, Sardinia; and I must
1964	Rid all the sea of pirates; then, to send
1965	Measures of wheat to Rome; this 'greed upon
1966	To part with unhack'd edges, and bear back
1967	Our targes undinted.
1968	
1969	
1970	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	|
1971	|
1972	MARK ANTONY	|  That's our offer.
1973	|
1974	LEPIDUS	|
1975	
1976	
1977	POMPEY	Know, then,
1978	I came before you here a man prepared
1979	To take this offer: but Mark Antony
1980	Put me to some impatience: though I lose
1981	The praise of it by telling, you must know,
1982	When Caesar and your brother were at blows,
1983	Your mother came to Sicily and did find
1984	Her welcome friendly.
1985	
1986	MARK ANTONY	I have heard it, Pompey;
1987	And am well studied for a liberal thanks
1988	Which I do owe you.
1989	
1990	POMPEY	Let me have your hand:
1991	I did not think, sir, to have met you here.
1992	
1993	MARK ANTONY	The beds i' the east are soft; and thanks to you,
1994	That call'd me timelier than my purpose hither;
1995	For I have gain'd by 't.
1996	
1997	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Since I saw you last,
1998	There is a change upon you.
1999	
2000	POMPEY	Well, I know not
2001	What counts harsh fortune casts upon my face;
2002	But in my bosom shall she never come,
2003	To make my heart her vassal.
2004	
2005	LEPIDUS	Well met here.
2006	
2007	POMPEY	I hope so, Lepidus. Thus we are agreed:
2008	I crave our composition may be written,
2009	And seal'd between us.
2010	
2011	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	That's the next to do.
2012	
2013	POMPEY	We'll feast each other ere we part; and let's
2014	Draw lots who shall begin.
2015	
2016	MARK ANTONY	That will I, Pompey.
2017	
2018	POMPEY	No, Antony, take the lot: but, first
2019	Or last, your fine Egyptian cookery
2020	Shall have the fame. I have heard that Julius Caesar
2021	Grew fat with feasting there.
2022	
2023	MARK ANTONY	You have heard much.
2024	
2025	POMPEY	I have fair meanings, sir.
2026	
2027	MARK ANTONY	And fair words to them.
2028	
2029	POMPEY	Then so much have I heard:
2030	And I have heard, Apollodorus carried--
2031	
2032	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	No more of that: he did so.
2033	
2034	POMPEY	What, I pray you?
2035	
2036	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	A certain queen to Caesar in a mattress.
2037	
2038	POMPEY	I know thee now: how farest thou, soldier?
2039	
2040	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Well;
2041	And well am like to do; for, I perceive,
2042	Four feasts are toward.
2043	
2044	POMPEY	Let me shake thy hand;
2045	I never hated thee: I have seen thee fight,
2046	When I have envied thy behavior.
2047	
2048	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Sir,
2049	I never loved you much; but I ha' praised ye,
2050	When you have well deserved ten times as much
2051	As I have said you did.
2052	
2053	POMPEY	Enjoy thy plainness,
2054	It nothing ill becomes thee.
2055	Aboard my galley I invite you all:
2056	Will you lead, lords?
2057	
2058	
2059	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	|
2060	|
2061	MARK ANTONY	|  Show us the way, sir.
2062	|
2063	LEPIDUS	|
2064	
2065	
2066	POMPEY	Come.
2067	
2068	[Exeunt all but MENAS and ENOBARBUS]
2069	
2070	MENAS	[Aside]  Thy father, Pompey, would ne'er have
2071	made this treaty.--You and I have known, sir.
2072	
2073	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	At sea, I think.
2074	
2075	MENAS	We have, sir.
2076	
2077	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	You have done well by water.
2078	
2079	MENAS	And you by land.
2080	
2081	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I will praise any man that will praise me; though it
2082	cannot be denied what I have done by land.
2083	
2084	MENAS	Nor what I have done by water.
2085	
2086	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Yes, something you can deny for your own
2087	safety: you have been a great thief by sea.
2088	
2089	MENAS	And you by land.
2090	
2091	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	There I deny my land service. But give me your
2092	hand, Menas: if our eyes had authority, here they
2093	might take two thieves kissing.
2094	
2095	MENAS	All men's faces are true, whatsome'er their hands are.
2096	
2097	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But there is never a fair woman has a true face.
2098	
2099	MENAS	No slander; they steal hearts.
2100	
2101	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	We came hither to fight with you.
2102	
2103	MENAS	For my part, I am sorry it is turned to a drinking.
2104	Pompey doth this day laugh away his fortune.
2105	
2106	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	If he do, sure, he cannot weep't back again.
2107	
2108	MENAS	You've said, sir. We looked not for Mark Antony
2109	here: pray you, is he married to Cleopatra?
2110	
2111	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Caesar's sister is called Octavia.
2112	
2113	MENAS	True, sir; she was the wife of Caius Marcellus.
2114	
2115	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But she is now the wife of Marcus Antonius.
2116	
2117	MENAS	Pray ye, sir?
2118	
2119	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	'Tis true.
2120	
2121	MENAS	Then is Caesar and he for ever knit together.
2122	
2123	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	If I were bound to divine of this unity, I would
2124	not prophesy so.
2125	
2126	MENAS	I think the policy of that purpose made more in the
2127	marriage than the love of the parties.
2128	
2129	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I think so too. But you shall find, the band that
2130	seems to tie their friendship together will be the
2131	very strangler of their amity: Octavia is of a
2132	holy, cold, and still conversation.
2133	
2134	MENAS	Who would not have his wife so?
2135	
2136	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Not he that himself is not so; which is Mark Antony.
2137	He will to his Egyptian dish again: then shall the
2138	sighs of Octavia blow the fire up in Caesar; and, as
2139	I said before, that which is the strength of their
2140	amity shall prove the immediate author of their
2141	variance. Antony will use his affection where it is:
2142	he married but his occasion here.
2143	
2144	MENAS	And thus it may be. Come, sir, will you aboard?
2145	I have a health for you.
2146	
2147	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I shall take it, sir: we have used our throats in Egypt.
2148	
2149	MENAS	Come, let's away.
2150	
2151	[Exeunt]

2155	
2156	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
2157	
2158	
2159	ACT II
2160	
2161	
2162	SCENE VII	On board POMPEY's galley, off Misenum.
2163	
2164	
2165	[Music plays. Enter two or three Servants with
2166	a banquet]
2167	
2168	First Servant	Here they'll be, man. Some o' their plants are
2169	ill-rooted already: the least wind i' the world
2170	will blow them down.
2171	
2172	Second Servant	Lepidus is high-coloured.
2173	
2174	First Servant	They have made him drink alms-drink.
2175	
2176	Second Servant	As they pinch one another by the disposition, he
2177	cries out 'No more;' reconciles them to his
2178	entreaty, and himself to the drink.
2179	
2180	First Servant	But it raises the greater war between him and
2181	his discretion.
2182	
2183	Second Servant	Why, this is to have a name in great men's
2184	fellowship: I had as lief have a reed that will do
2185	me no service as a partisan I could not heave.
2186	
2187	First Servant	To be called into a huge sphere, and not to be seen
2188	to move in't, are the holes where eyes should be,
2189	which pitifully disaster the cheeks.
2190	
2191	[A sennet sounded. Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK
2192	ANTONY, LEPIDUS, POMPEY, AGRIPPA, MECAENAS,
2193	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, MENAS, with other captains]
2194	
2195	MARK ANTONY	[To OCTAVIUS CAESAR]  Thus do they, sir: they take
2196	the flow o' the Nile
2197	By certain scales i' the pyramid; they know,
2198	By the height, the lowness, or the mean, if dearth
2199	Or foison follow: the higher Nilus swells,
2200	The more it promises: as it ebbs, the seedsman
2201	Upon the slime and ooze scatters his grain,
2202	And shortly comes to harvest.
2203	
2204	LEPIDUS	You've strange serpents there.
2205	
2206	MARK ANTONY	Ay, Lepidus.
2207	
2208	LEPIDUS	Your serpent of Egypt is bred now of your mud by the
2209	operation of your sun: so is your crocodile.
2210	
2211	MARK ANTONY	They are so.
2212	
2213	POMPEY	Sit,--and some wine! A health to Lepidus!
2214	
2215	LEPIDUS	I am not so well as I should be, but I'll ne'er out.
2216	
2217	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Not till you have slept; I fear me you'll be in till then.
2218	
2219	LEPIDUS	Nay, certainly, I have heard the Ptolemies'
2220	pyramises are very goodly things; without
2221	contradiction, I have heard that.
2222	
2223	MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY]  Pompey, a word.
2224	
2225	POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]                 Say in mine ear:
2226	what is't?
2227	
2228	MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY]  Forsake thy seat, I do beseech
2229	thee, captain,
2230	And hear me speak a word.
2231	
2232	POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]  Forbear me till anon.
2233	This wine for Lepidus!
2234	
2235	LEPIDUS	What manner o' thing is your crocodile?
2236	
2237	MARK ANTONY	It is shaped, sir, like itself; and it is as broad
2238	as it hath breadth: it is just so high as it is,
2239	and moves with its own organs: it lives by that
2240	which nourisheth it; and the elements once out of
2241	it, it transmigrates.
2242	
2243	LEPIDUS	What colour is it of?
2244	
2245	MARK ANTONY	Of it own colour too.
2246	
2247	LEPIDUS	'Tis a strange serpent.
2248	
2249	MARK ANTONY	'Tis so. And the tears of it are wet.
2250	
2251	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Will this description satisfy him?
2252	
2253	MARK ANTONY	With the health that Pompey gives him, else he is a
2254	very epicure.
2255	
2256	POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]  Go hang, sir, hang! Tell me of
2257	that? away!
2258	Do as I bid you. Where's this cup I call'd for?
2259	
2260	MENAS	[Aside to POMPEY]  If for the sake of merit thou
2261	wilt hear me,
2262	Rise from thy stool.
2263	
2264	POMPEY	[Aside to MENAS]  I think thou'rt mad.
2265	The matter?
2266	
2267	[Rises, and walks aside]
2268	
2269	MENAS	I have ever held my cap off to thy fortunes.
2270	
2271	POMPEY	Thou hast served me with much faith. What's else to say?
2272	Be jolly, lords.
2273	
2274	MARK ANTONY	                  These quick-sands, Lepidus,
2275	Keep off them, for you sink.
2276	
2277	MENAS	Wilt thou be lord of all the world?
2278	
2279	POMPEY	What say'st thou?
2280	
2281	MENAS	Wilt thou be lord of the whole world? That's twice.
2282	
2283	POMPEY	How should that be?
2284	
2285	MENAS	But entertain it,
2286	And, though thou think me poor, I am the man
2287	Will give thee all the world.
2288	
2289	POMPEY	Hast thou drunk well?
2290	
2291	MENAS	Now, Pompey, I have kept me from the cup.
2292	Thou art, if thou darest be, the earthly Jove:
2293	Whate'er the ocean pales, or sky inclips,
2294	Is thine, if thou wilt ha't.
2295	
2296	POMPEY	Show me which way.
2297	
2298	MENAS	These three world-sharers, these competitors,
2299	Are in thy vessel: let me cut the cable;
2300	And, when we are put off, fall to their throats:
2301	All there is thine.
2302	
2303	POMPEY	Ah, this thou shouldst have done,
2304	And not have spoke on't! In me 'tis villany;
2305	In thee't had been good service. Thou must know,
2306	'Tis not my profit that does lead mine honour;
2307	Mine honour, it. Repent that e'er thy tongue
2308	Hath so betray'd thine act: being done unknown,
2309	I should have found it afterwards well done;
2310	But must condemn it now. Desist, and drink.
2311	
2312	MENAS	[Aside]  For this,
2313	I'll never follow thy pall'd fortunes more.
2314	Who seeks, and will not take when once 'tis offer'd,
2315	Shall never find it more.
2316	
2317	POMPEY	This health to Lepidus!
2318	
2319	MARK ANTONY	Bear him ashore. I'll pledge it for him, Pompey.
2320	
2321	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Here's to thee, Menas!
2322	
2323	MENAS	Enobarbus, welcome!
2324	
2325	POMPEY	Fill till the cup be hid.
2326	
2327	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	There's a strong fellow, Menas.
2328	
2329	[Pointing to the Attendant who carries off LEPIDUS]
2330	
2331	MENAS	Why?
2332	
2333	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	A' bears the third part of the world, man; see'st
2334	not?
2335	
2336	MENAS	The third part, then, is drunk: would it were all,
2337	That it might go on wheels!
2338	
2339	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Drink thou; increase the reels.
2340	
2341	MENAS	Come.
2342	
2343	POMPEY	This is not yet an Alexandrian feast.
2344	
2345	MARK ANTONY	It ripens towards it. Strike the vessels, ho?
2346	Here is to Caesar!
2347	
2348	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  I could well forbear't.
2349	It's monstrous labour, when I wash my brain,
2350	And it grows fouler.
2351	
2352	MARK ANTONY	Be a child o' the time.
2353	
2354	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Possess it, I'll make answer:
2355	But I had rather fast from all four days
2356	Than drink so much in one.
2357	
2358	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ha, my brave emperor!
2359	
2360	[To MARK ANTONY]
2361	
2362	Shall we dance now the Egyptian Bacchanals,
2363	And celebrate our drink?
2364	
2365	POMPEY	Let's ha't, good soldier.
2366	
2367	MARK ANTONY	Come, let's all take hands,
2368	Till that the conquering wine hath steep'd our sense
2369	In soft and delicate Lethe.
2370	
2371	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	All take hands.
2372	Make battery to our ears with the loud music:
2373	The while I'll place you: then the boy shall sing;
2374	The holding every man shall bear as loud
2375	As his strong sides can volley.
2376	
2377	[Music plays. DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS places them
2378	hand in hand]
2379	THE SONG.
2380	
2381	Come, thou monarch of the vine,
2382	Plumpy Bacchus with pink eyne!
2383	In thy fats our cares be drown'd,
2384	With thy grapes our hairs be crown'd:
2385	Cup us, till the world go round,
2386	Cup us, till the world go round!
2387	
2388	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	What would you more? Pompey, good night. Good brother,
2389	Let me request you off: our graver business
2390	Frowns at this levity. Gentle lords, let's part;
2391	You see we have burnt our cheeks: strong Enobarb
2392	Is weaker than the wine; and mine own tongue
2393	Splits what it speaks: the wild disguise hath almost
2394	Antick'd us all. What needs more words? Good night.
2395	Good Antony, your hand.
2396	
2397	POMPEY	I'll try you on the shore.
2398	
2399	MARK ANTONY	And shall, sir; give's your hand.
2400	
2401	POMPEY	O Antony,
2402	You have my father's house,--But, what? we are friends.
2403	Come, down into the boat.
2404	
2405	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Take heed you fall not.
2406	
2407	[Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and MENAS]
2408	
2409	Menas, I'll not on shore.
2410	
2411	MENAS	No, to my cabin.
2412	These drums! these trumpets, flutes! what!
2413	Let Neptune hear we bid a loud farewell
2414	To these great fellows: sound and be hang'd, sound out!
2415	
2416	[Sound a flourish, with drums]
2417	
2418	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ho! says a' There's my cap.
2419	
2420	MENAS	Ho! Noble captain, come.
2421	
2422	[Exeunt]

2427	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
2428	
2429	
2430	ACT III
2431	
2432	
2433	
2434	SCENE I	A plain in Syria.
2435	
2436	
2437	[Enter VENTIDIUS as it were in triumph, with SILIUS,
2438	and other Romans, Officers, and Soldiers; the dead
2439	body of PACORUS borne before him]
2440	
2441	VENTIDIUS	Now, darting Parthia, art thou struck; and now
2442	Pleased fortune does of Marcus Crassus' death
2443	Make me revenger. Bear the king's son's body
2444	Before our army. Thy Pacorus, Orodes,
2445	Pays this for Marcus Crassus.
2446	
2447	SILIUS	Noble Ventidius,
2448	Whilst yet with Parthian blood thy sword is warm,
2449	The fugitive Parthians follow; spur through Media,
2450	Mesopotamia, and the shelters whither
2451	The routed fly: so thy grand captain Antony
2452	Shall set thee on triumphant chariots and
2453	Put garlands on thy head.
2454	
2455	VENTIDIUS	O Silius, Silius,
2456	I have done enough; a lower place, note well,
2457	May make too great an act: for learn this, Silius;
2458	Better to leave undone, than by our deed
2459	Acquire too high a fame when him we serve's away.
2460	Caesar and Antony have ever won
2461	More in their officer than person: Sossius,
2462	One of my place in Syria, his lieutenant,
2463	For quick accumulation of renown,
2464	Which he achieved by the minute, lost his favour.
2465	Who does i' the wars more than his captain can
2466	Becomes his captain's captain: and ambition,
2467	The soldier's virtue, rather makes choice of loss,
2468	Than gain which darkens him.
2469	I could do more to do Antonius good,
2470	But 'twould offend him; and in his offence
2471	Should my performance perish.
2472	
2473	SILIUS	Thou hast, Ventidius,
2474	that
2475	Without the which a soldier, and his sword,
2476	Grants scarce distinction. Thou wilt write to Antony!
2477	
2478	VENTIDIUS	I'll humbly signify what in his name,
2479	That magical word of war, we have effected;
2480	How, with his banners and his well-paid ranks,
2481	The ne'er-yet-beaten horse of Parthia
2482	We have jaded out o' the field.
2483	
2484	SILIUS	Where is he now?
2485	
2486	VENTIDIUS	He purposeth to Athens: whither, with what haste
2487	The weight we must convey with's will permit,
2488	We shall appear before him. On there; pass along!
2489	
2490	[Exeunt]

2495	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
2496	
2497	
2498	ACT III
2499	
2500	
2501	
2502	SCENE II	Rome. An ante-chamber in OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
2503	
2504	
2505	[Enter AGRIPPA at one door, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS
2506	at another]
2507	
2508	AGRIPPA	What, are the brothers parted?
2509	
2510	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	They have dispatch'd with Pompey, he is gone;
2511	The other three are sealing. Octavia weeps
2512	To part from Rome; Caesar is sad; and Lepidus,
2513	Since Pompey's feast, as Menas says, is troubled
2514	With the green sickness.
2515	
2516	AGRIPPA	'Tis a noble Lepidus.
2517	
2518	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	A very fine one: O, how he loves Caesar!
2519	
2520	AGRIPPA	Nay, but how dearly he adores Mark Antony!
2521	
2522	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Caesar? Why, he's the Jupiter of men.
2523	
2524	AGRIPPA	What's Antony? The god of Jupiter.
2525	
2526	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Spake you of Caesar? How! the non-pareil!
2527	
2528	AGRIPPA	O Antony! O thou Arabian bird!
2529	
2530	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Would you praise Caesar, say 'Caesar:' go no further.
2531	
2532	AGRIPPA	Indeed, he plied them both with excellent praises.
2533	
2534	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But he loves Caesar best; yet he loves Antony:
2535	Ho! hearts, tongues, figures, scribes, bards,
2536	poets, cannot
2537	Think, speak, cast, write, sing, number, ho!
2538	His love to Antony. But as for Caesar,
2539	Kneel down, kneel down, and wonder.
2540	
2541	AGRIPPA	Both he loves.
2542	
2543	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	They are his shards, and he their beetle.
2544	
2545	[Trumpets within]
2546	So;
2547	This is to horse. Adieu, noble Agrippa.
2548	
2549	AGRIPPA	Good fortune, worthy soldier; and farewell.
2550	
2551	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, MARK ANTONY, LEPIDUS, and OCTAVIA]
2552	
2553	MARK ANTONY	No further, sir.
2554	
2555	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You take from me a great part of myself;
2556	Use me well in 't. Sister, prove such a wife
2557	As my thoughts make thee, and as my farthest band
2558	Shall pass on thy approof. Most noble Antony,
2559	Let not the piece of virtue, which is set
2560	Betwixt us as the cement of our love,
2561	To keep it builded, be the ram to batter
2562	The fortress of it; for better might we
2563	Have loved without this mean, if on both parts
2564	This be not cherish'd.
2565	
2566	MARK ANTONY	Make me not offended
2567	In your distrust.
2568	
2569	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  I have said.
2570	
2571	MARK ANTONY	You shall not find,
2572	Though you be therein curious, the least cause
2573	For what you seem to fear: so, the gods keep you,
2574	And make the hearts of Romans serve your ends!
2575	We will here part.
2576	
2577	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Farewell, my dearest sister, fare thee well:
2578	The elements be kind to thee, and make
2579	Thy spirits all of comfort! fare thee well.
2580	
2581	OCTAVIA	My noble brother!
2582	
2583	MARK ANTONY	The April 's in her eyes: it is love's spring,
2584	And these the showers to bring it on. Be cheerful.
2585	
2586	OCTAVIA	Sir, look well to my husband's house; and--
2587	
2588	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	What, Octavia?
2589	
2590	OCTAVIA	       I'll tell you in your ear.
2591	
2592	MARK ANTONY	Her tongue will not obey her heart, nor can
2593	Her heart inform her tongue,--the swan's
2594	down-feather,
2595	That stands upon the swell at full of tide,
2596	And neither way inclines.
2597	
2598	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA]  Will Caesar weep?
2599	
2600	AGRIPPA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  He has a cloud in 's face.
2601	
2602	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA]  He were the worse for that,
2603	were he a horse;
2604	So is he, being a man.
2605	
2606	AGRIPPA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  Why, Enobarbus,
2607	When Antony found Julius Caesar dead,
2608	He cried almost to roaring; and he wept
2609	When at Philippi he found Brutus slain.
2610	
2611	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to AGRIPPA]  That year, indeed, he was
2612	troubled with a rheum;
2613	What willingly he did confound he wail'd,
2614	Believe't, till I wept too.
2615	
2616	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	No, sweet Octavia,
2617	You shall hear from me still; the time shall not
2618	Out-go my thinking on you.
2619	
2620	MARK ANTONY	Come, sir, come;
2621	I'll wrestle with you in my strength of love:
2622	Look, here I have you; thus I let you go,
2623	And give you to the gods.
2624	
2625	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Adieu; be happy!
2626	
2627	LEPIDUS	Let all the number of the stars give light
2628	To thy fair way!
2629	
2630	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Farewell, farewell!
2631	
2632	[Kisses OCTAVIA]
2633	
2634	MARK ANTONY	Farewell!
2635

2642	
2643	
2644	ACT III
2645	
2646	
2647	
2648	SCENE III	Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
2649	
2650	
2651	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, IRAS, and ALEXAS]
2652	
2653	CLEOPATRA	Where is the fellow?
2654	
2655	ALEXAS	Half afeard to come.
2656	
2657	CLEOPATRA	Go to, go to.
2658	
2659	[Enter the Messenger as before]
2660	
2661	Come hither, sir.
2662	
2663	ALEXAS	Good majesty,
2664	Herod of Jewry dare not look upon you
2665	But when you are well pleased.
2666	
2667	CLEOPATRA	That Herod's head
2668	I'll have: but how, when Antony is gone
2669	Through whom I might command it? Come thou near.
2670	
2671	Messenger	Most gracious majesty,--
2672	
2673	CLEOPATRA	Didst thou behold Octavia?
2674	
2675	Messenger	Ay, dread queen.
2676	
2677	CLEOPATRA	Where?
2678	
2679	Messenger	Madam, in Rome;
2680	I look'd her in the face, and saw her led
2681	Between her brother and Mark Antony.
2682	
2683	CLEOPATRA	Is she as tall as me?
2684	
2685	Messenger	She is not, madam.
2686	
2687	CLEOPATRA	Didst hear her speak? is she shrill-tongued or low?
2688	
2689	Messenger	Madam, I heard her speak; she is low-voiced.
2690	
2691	CLEOPATRA	That's not so good: he cannot like her long.
2692	
2693	CHARMIAN	Like her! O Isis! 'tis impossible.
2694	
2695	CLEOPATRA	I think so, Charmian: dull of tongue, and dwarfish!
2696	What majesty is in her gait? Remember,
2697	If e'er thou look'dst on majesty.
2698	
2699	Messenger	She creeps:
2700	Her motion and her station are as one;
2701	She shows a body rather than a life,
2702	A statue than a breather.
2703	
2704	CLEOPATRA	Is this certain?
2705	
2706	Messenger	Or I have no observance.
2707	
2708	CHARMIAN	Three in Egypt
2709	Cannot make better note.
2710	
2711	CLEOPATRA	He's very knowing;
2712	I do perceive't: there's nothing in her yet:
2713	The fellow has good judgment.
2714	
2715	CHARMIAN	Excellent.
2716	
2717	CLEOPATRA	Guess at her years, I prithee.
2718	
2719	Messenger	Madam,
2720	She was a widow,--
2721	
2722	CLEOPATRA	                  Widow! Charmian, hark.
2723	
2724	Messenger	And I do think she's thirty.
2725	
2726	CLEOPATRA	Bear'st thou her face in mind? is't long or round?
2727	
2728	Messenger	Round even to faultiness.
2729	
2730	CLEOPATRA	For the most part, too, they are foolish that are so.
2731	Her hair, what colour?
2732	
2733	Messenger	Brown, madam: and her forehead
2734	As low as she would wish it.
2735	
2736	CLEOPATRA	There's gold for thee.
2737	Thou must not take my former sharpness ill:
2738	I will employ thee back again; I find thee
2739	Most fit for business: go make thee ready;
2740	Our letters are prepared.
2741	
2742	[Exit Messenger]
2743	
2744	CHARMIAN	A proper man.
2745	
2746	CLEOPATRA	Indeed, he is so: I repent me much
2747	That so I harried him. Why, methinks, by him,
2748	This creature's no such thing.
2749	
2750	CHARMIAN	Nothing, madam.
2751	
2752	CLEOPATRA	The man hath seen some majesty, and should know.
2753	
2754	CHARMIAN	Hath he seen majesty? Isis else defend,
2755	And serving you so long!
2756	
2757	CLEOPATRA	I have one thing more to ask him yet, good Charmian:
2758	But 'tis no matter; thou shalt bring him to me
2759	Where I will write. All may be well enough.
2760	
2761	CHARMIAN	I warrant you, madam.
2762	
2763	[Exeunt]

2778	
2779	MARK ANTONY	Nay, nay, Octavia, not only that,--
2780	That were excusable, that, and thousands more
2781	Of semblable import,--but he hath waged
2782	New wars 'gainst Pompey; made his will, and read it
2783	To public ear:
2784	Spoke scantly of me: when perforce he could not
2785	But pay me terms of honour, cold and sickly
2786	He vented them; most narrow measure lent me:
2787	When the best hint was given him, he not took't,
2788	Or did it from his teeth.
2789	
2790	OCTAVIA	O my good lord,
2791	Believe not all; or, if you must believe,
2792	Stomach not all. A more unhappy lady,
2793	If this division chance, ne'er stood between,
2794	Praying for both parts:
2795	The good gods me presently,
2796	When I shall pray, 'O bless my lord and husband!'
2797	Undo that prayer, by crying out as loud,
2798	'O, bless my brother!' Husband win, win brother,
2799	Prays, and destroys the prayer; no midway
2800	'Twixt these extremes at all.
2801	
2802	MARK ANTONY	Gentle Octavia,
2803	Let your best love draw to that point, which seeks
2804	Best to preserve it: if I lose mine honour,
2805	I lose myself: better I were not yours
2806	Than yours so branchless. But, as you requested,
2807	Yourself shall go between 's: the mean time, lady,
2808	I'll raise the preparation of a war
2809	Shall stain your brother: make your soonest haste;
2810	So your desires are yours.
2811	
2812	OCTAVIA	Thanks to my lord.
2813	The Jove of power make me most weak, most weak,
2814	Your reconciler! Wars 'twixt you twain would be
2815	As if the world should cleave, and that slain men
2816	Should solder up the rift.
2817	
2818	MARK ANTONY	When it appears to you where this begins,
2819	Turn your displeasure that way: for our faults
2820	Can never be so equal, that your love
2821	Can equally move with them. Provide your going;
2822	Choose your own company, and command what cost
2823	Your heart has mind to.

2840	[Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS and EROS, meeting]
2841	
2842	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	How now, friend Eros!
2843	
2844	EROS	There's strange news come, sir.
2845	
2846	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What, man?
2847	
2848	EROS	Caesar and Lepidus have made wars upon Pompey.
2849	
2850	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	This is old: what is the success?
2851	
2852	EROS	Caesar, having made use of him in the wars 'gainst
2853	Pompey, presently denied him rivality; would not let
2854	him partake in the glory of the action: and not
2855	resting here, accuses him of letters he had formerly
2856	wrote to Pompey; upon his own appeal, seizes him: so
2857	the poor third is up, till death enlarge his confine.
2858	
2859	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Then, world, thou hast a pair of chaps, no more;
2860	And throw between them all the food thou hast,
2861	They'll grind the one the other. Where's Antony?
2862	
2863	EROS	He's walking in the garden--thus; and spurns
2864	The rush that lies before him; cries, 'Fool Lepidus!'
2865	And threats the throat of that his officer
2866	That murder'd Pompey.
2867	
2868	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Our great navy's rigg'd.
2869	
2870	EROS	For Italy and Caesar. More, Domitius;
2871	My lord desires you presently: my news
2872	I might have told hereafter.
2873	
2874	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	'Twill be naught:
2875	But let it be. Bring me to Antony.
2876	
2877	EROS	Come, sir.

2887	ACT III
2888	
2889	
2890	
2891	SCENE VI	Rome. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's house.
2892	
2893	
2894	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS]
2895	
2896	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Contemning Rome, he has done all this, and more,
2897	In Alexandria: here's the manner of 't:
2898	I' the market-place, on a tribunal silver'd,
2899	Cleopatra and himself in chairs of gold
2900	Were publicly enthroned: at the feet sat
2901	Caesarion, whom they call my father's son,
2902	And all the unlawful issue that their lust
2903	Since then hath made between them. Unto her
2904	He gave the stablishment of Egypt; made her
2905	Of lower Syria, Cyprus, Lydia,
2906	Absolute queen.
2907	
2908	MECAENAS	                  This in the public eye?
2909	
2910	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I' the common show-place, where they exercise.
2911	His sons he there proclaim'd the kings of kings:
2912	Great Media, Parthia, and Armenia.
2913	He gave to Alexander; to Ptolemy he assign'd
2914	Syria, Cilicia, and Phoenicia: she
2915	In the habiliments of the goddess Isis
2916	That day appear'd; and oft before gave audience,
2917	As 'tis reported, so.
2918	
2919	MECAENAS	Let Rome be thus Inform'd.
2920	
2921	AGRIPPA	Who, queasy with his insolence
2922	Already, will their good thoughts call from him.
2923	
2924	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	The people know it; and have now received
2925	His accusations.
2926	
2927	AGRIPPA	                  Who does he accuse?
2928	
2929	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Caesar: and that, having in Sicily
2930	Sextus Pompeius spoil'd, we had not rated him
2931	His part o' the isle: then does he say, he lent me
2932	Some shipping unrestored: lastly, he frets
2933	That Lepidus of the triumvirate
2934	Should be deposed; and, being, that we detain
2935	All his revenue.
2936	
2937	AGRIPPA	                  Sir, this should be answer'd.
2938	
2939	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	'Tis done already, and the messenger gone.
2940	I have told him, Lepidus was grown too cruel;
2941	That he his high authority abused,
2942	And did deserve his change: for what I have conquer'd,
2943	I grant him part; but then, in his Armenia,
2944	And other of his conquer'd kingdoms, I
2945	Demand the like.
2946	
2947	MECAENAS	                  He'll never yield to that.
2948	
2949	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Nor must not then be yielded to in this.
2950	
2951	[Enter OCTAVIA with her train]
2952	
2953	OCTAVIA	Hail, Caesar, and my lord! hail, most dear Caesar!
2954	
2955	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	That ever I should call thee castaway!
2956	
2957	OCTAVIA	You have not call'd me so, nor have you cause.
2958	
2959	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Why have you stol'n upon us thus! You come not
2960	Like Caesar's sister: the wife of Antony
2961	Should have an army for an usher, and
2962	The neighs of horse to tell of her approach
2963	Long ere she did appear; the trees by the way
2964	Should have borne men; and expectation fainted,
2965	Longing for what it had not; nay, the dust
2966	Should have ascended to the roof of heaven,
2967	Raised by your populous troops: but you are come
2968	A market-maid to Rome; and have prevented
2969	The ostentation of our love, which, left unshown,
2970	Is often left unloved; we should have met you
2971	By sea and land; supplying every stage
2972	With an augmented greeting.
2973	
2974	OCTAVIA	Good my lord,
2975	To come thus was I not constrain'd, but did
2976	On my free will. My lord, Mark Antony,
2977	Hearing that you prepared for war, acquainted
2978	My grieved ear withal; whereon, I begg'd
2979	His pardon for return.
2980	
2981	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Which soon he granted,
2982	Being an obstruct 'tween his lust and him.
2983	
2984	OCTAVIA	Do not say so, my lord.
2985	
2986	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	I have eyes upon him,
2987	And his affairs come to me on the wind.
2988	Where is he now?
2989	
2990	OCTAVIA	                  My lord, in Athens.
2991	
2992	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	No, my most wronged sister; Cleopatra
2993	Hath nodded him to her. He hath given his empire
2994	Up to a whore; who now are levying
2995	The kings o' the earth for war; he hath assembled
2996	Bocchus, the king of Libya; Archelaus,
2997	Of Cappadocia; Philadelphos, king
2998	Of Paphlagonia; the Thracian king, Adallas;
2999	King Malchus of Arabia; King of Pont;
3000	Herod of Jewry; Mithridates, king
3001	Of Comagene; Polemon and Amyntas,
3002	The kings of Mede and Lycaonia,
3003	With a more larger list of sceptres.
3004	
3005	OCTAVIA	Ay me, most wretched,
3006	That have my heart parted betwixt two friends
3007	That do afflict each other!
3008	
3009	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Welcome hither:
3010	Your letters did withhold our breaking forth;
3011	Till we perceived, both how you were wrong led,
3012	And we in negligent danger. Cheer your heart;
3013	Be you not troubled with the time, which drives
3014	O'er your content these strong necessities;
3015	But let determined things to destiny
3016	Hold unbewail'd their way. Welcome to Rome;
3017	Nothing more dear to me. You are abused
3018	Beyond the mark of thought: and the high gods,
3019	To do you justice, make them ministers
3020	Of us and those that love you. Best of comfort;
3021	And ever welcome to us.
3022	
3023	AGRIPPA	Welcome, lady.
3024	
3025	MECAENAS	Welcome, dear madam.
3026	Each heart in Rome does love and pity you:
3027	Only the adulterous Antony, most large
3028	In his abominations, turns you off;
3029	And gives his potent regiment to a trull,
3030	That noises it against us.
3031	
3032	OCTAVIA	Is it so, sir?
3033	
3034	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Most certain. Sister, welcome: pray you,
3035	Be ever known to patience: my dear'st sister!

3048	
3049	SCENE VII	Near Actium. MARK ANTONY's camp.
3050	
3051	
3052	[Enter CLEOPATRA and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
3053	
3054	CLEOPATRA	I will be even with thee, doubt it not.
3055	
3056	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	But why, why, why?
3057	
3058	CLEOPATRA	Thou hast forspoke my being in these wars,
3059	And say'st it is not fit.
3060	
3061	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Well, is it, is it?
3062	
3063	CLEOPATRA	If not denounced against us, why should not we
3064	Be there in person?
3065	
3066	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  Well, I could reply:
3067	If we should serve with horse and mares together,
3068	The horse were merely lost; the mares would bear
3069	A soldier and his horse.
3070	
3071	CLEOPATRA	What is't you say?
3072	
3073	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Your presence needs must puzzle Antony;
3074	Take from his heart, take from his brain,
3075	from's time,
3076	What should not then be spared. He is already
3077	Traduced for levity; and 'tis said in Rome
3078	That Photinus an eunuch and your maids
3079	Manage this war.
3080	
3081	CLEOPATRA	                  Sink Rome, and their tongues rot
3082	That speak against us! A charge we bear i' the war,
3083	And, as the president of my kingdom, will
3084	Appear there for a man. Speak not against it:
3085	I will not stay behind.
3086	
3087	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Nay, I have done.
3088	Here comes the emperor.
3089	
3090	[Enter MARK ANTONY and CANIDIUS]
3091	
3092	MARK ANTONY	Is it not strange, Canidius,
3093	That from Tarentum and Brundusium
3094	He could so quickly cut the Ionian sea,
3095	And take in Toryne? You have heard on't, sweet?
3096	
3097	CLEOPATRA	Celerity is never more admired
3098	Than by the negligent.
3099	
3100	MARK ANTONY	A good rebuke,
3101	Which might have well becomed the best of men,
3102	To taunt at slackness. Canidius, we
3103	Will fight with him by sea.
3104	
3105	CLEOPATRA	By sea! what else?
3106	
3107	CANIDIUS	Why will my lord do so?
3108	
3109	MARK ANTONY	For that he dares us to't.
3110	
3111	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	So hath my lord dared him to single fight.
3112	
3113	CANIDIUS	Ay, and to wage this battle at Pharsalia.
3114	Where Caesar fought with Pompey: but these offers,
3115	Which serve not for his vantage, be shakes off;
3116	And so should you.
3117	
3118	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  Your ships are not well mann'd;
3119	Your mariners are muleters, reapers, people
3120	Ingross'd by swift impress; in Caesar's fleet
3121	Are those that often have 'gainst Pompey fought:
3122	Their ships are yare; yours, heavy: no disgrace
3123	Shall fall you for refusing him at sea,
3124	Being prepared for land.
3125	
3126	MARK ANTONY	By sea, by sea.
3127	
3128	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Most worthy sir, you therein throw away
3129	The absolute soldiership you have by land;
3130	Distract your army, which doth most consist
3131	Of war-mark'd footmen; leave unexecuted
3132	Your own renowned knowledge; quite forego
3133	The way which promises assurance; and
3134	Give up yourself merely to chance and hazard,
3135	From firm security.
3136	
3137	MARK ANTONY	I'll fight at sea.
3138	
3139	CLEOPATRA	I have sixty sails, Caesar none better.
3140	
3141	MARK ANTONY	Our overplus of shipping will we burn;
3142	And, with the rest full-mann'd, from the head of Actium
3143	Beat the approaching Caesar. But if we fail,
3144	We then can do't at land.
3145	
3146	[Enter a Messenger]
3147	
3148	Thy business?
3149	
3150	Messenger	The news is true, my lord; he is descried;
3151	Caesar has taken Toryne.
3152	
3153	MARK ANTONY	Can he be there in person? 'tis impossible;
3154	Strange that power should be. Canidius,
3155	Our nineteen legions thou shalt hold by land,
3156	And our twelve thousand horse. We'll to our ship:
3157	Away, my Thetis!
3158	
3159	[Enter a Soldier]
3160	
3161	How now, worthy soldier?
3162	
3163	Soldier	O noble emperor, do not fight by sea;
3164	Trust not to rotten planks: do you misdoubt
3165	This sword and these my wounds? Let the Egyptians
3166	And the Phoenicians go a-ducking; we
3167	Have used to conquer, standing on the earth,
3168	And fighting foot to foot.
3169	
3170	MARK ANTONY	Well, well: away!
3171	
3172	[Exeunt MARK ANTONY, QUEEN CLEOPATRA, and DOMITIUS
3173	ENOBARBUS]
3174	
3175	Soldier	By Hercules, I think I am i' the right.
3176	
3177	CANIDIUS	Soldier, thou art: but his whole action grows
3178	Not in the power on't: so our leader's led,
3179	And we are women's men.
3180	
3181	Soldier	You keep by land
3182	The legions and the horse whole, do you not?
3183	
3184	CANIDIUS	Marcus Octavius, Marcus Justeius,
3185	Publicola, and Caelius, are for sea:
3186	But we keep whole by land. This speed of Caesar's
3187	Carries beyond belief.
3188	
3189	Soldier	While he was yet in Rome,
3190	His power went out in such distractions as
3191	Beguiled all spies.
3192	
3193	CANIDIUS	Who's his lieutenant, hear you?
3194	
3195	Soldier	They say, one Taurus.
3196	
3197	CANIDIUS	Well I know the man.
3198	
3199	[Enter a Messenger]
3200	
3201	Messenger	The emperor calls Canidius.

3272	
3273	[Alarum. Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
3274	
3275	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Naught, naught all, naught! I can behold no longer:
3276	The Antoniad, the Egyptian admiral,
3277	With all their sixty, fly and turn the rudder:
3278	To see't mine eyes are blasted.
3279	
3280	[Enter SCARUS]
3281	
3282	SCARUS	Gods and goddesses,
3283	All the whole synod of them!
3284	
3285	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What's thy passion!
3286	
3287	SCARUS	The greater cantle of the world is lost
3288	With very ignorance; we have kiss'd away
3289	Kingdoms and provinces.
3290	
3291	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	How appears the fight?
3292	
3293	SCARUS	On our side like the token'd pestilence,
3294	Where death is sure. Yon ribaudred nag of Egypt,--
3295	Whom leprosy o'ertake!--i' the midst o' the fight,
3296	When vantage like a pair of twins appear'd,
3297	Both as the same, or rather ours the elder,
3298	The breese upon her, like a cow in June,
3299	Hoists sails and flies.
3300	
3301	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	That I beheld:
3302	Mine eyes did sicken at the sight, and could not
3303	Endure a further view.
3304	
3305	SCARUS	She once being loof'd,
3306	The noble ruin of her magic, Antony,
3307	Claps on his sea-wing, and, like a doting mallard,
3308	Leaving the fight in height, flies after her:
3309	I never saw an action of such shame;
3310	Experience, manhood, honour, ne'er before
3311	Did violate so itself.
3312	
3313	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Alack, alack!
3314	
3315	[Enter CANIDIUS]
3316	
3317	CANIDIUS	Our fortune on the sea is out of breath,
3318	And sinks most lamentably. Had our general
3319	Been what he knew himself, it had gone well:
3320	O, he has given example for our flight,
3321	Most grossly, by his own!
3322	
3323	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Ay, are you thereabouts?
3324	Why, then, good night indeed.
3325	
3326	CANIDIUS	Toward Peloponnesus are they fled.
3327	
3328	SCARUS	'Tis easy to't; and there I will attend
3329	What further comes.
3330	
3331	CANIDIUS	To Caesar will I render
3332	My legions and my horse: six kings already
3333	Show me the way of yielding.
3334	
3335	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I'll yet follow
3336	The wounded chance of Antony, though my reason
3337	Sits in the wind against me.

3350	
3351	SCENE XI	Alexandria. CLEOPATRA's palace.
3352	
3353	
3354	[Enter MARK ANTONY with Attendants]
3355	
3356	MARK ANTONY	Hark! the land bids me tread no more upon't;
3357	It is ashamed to bear me! Friends, come hither:
3358	I am so lated in the world, that I
3359	Have lost my way for ever: I have a ship
3360	Laden with gold; take that, divide it; fly,
3361	And make your peace with Caesar.
3362	
3363	All	Fly! not we.
3364	
3365	MARK ANTONY	I have fled myself; and have instructed cowards
3366	To run and show their shoulders. Friends, be gone;
3367	I have myself resolved upon a course
3368	Which has no need of you; be gone:
3369	My treasure's in the harbour, take it. O,
3370	I follow'd that I blush to look upon:
3371	My very hairs do mutiny; for the white
3372	Reprove the brown for rashness, and they them
3373	For fear and doting. Friends, be gone: you shall
3374	Have letters from me to some friends that will
3375	Sweep your way for you. Pray you, look not sad,
3376	Nor make replies of loathness: take the hint
3377	Which my despair proclaims; let that be left
3378	Which leaves itself: to the sea-side straightway:
3379	I will possess you of that ship and treasure.
3380	Leave me, I pray, a little: pray you now:
3381	Nay, do so; for, indeed, I have lost command,
3382	Therefore I pray you: I'll see you by and by.
3383	
3384	[Sits down]
3385	
3386	[Enter CLEOPATRA led by CHARMIAN and IRAS; EROS
3387	following]
3388	
3389	EROS	Nay, gentle madam, to him, comfort him.
3390	
3391	IRAS	Do, most dear queen.
3392	
3393	CHARMIAN	Do! why: what else?
3394	
3395	CLEOPATRA	Let me sit down. O Juno!
3396	
3397	MARK ANTONY	No, no, no, no, no.
3398	
3399	EROS	See you here, sir?
3400	
3401	MARK ANTONY	O fie, fie, fie!
3402	
3403	CHARMIAN	Madam!
3404	
3405	IRAS	Madam, O good empress!
3406	
3407	EROS	Sir, sir,--
3408	
3409	MARK ANTONY	Yes, my lord, yes; he at Philippi kept
3410	His sword e'en like a dancer; while I struck
3411	The lean and wrinkled Cassius; and 'twas I
3412	That the mad Brutus ended: he alone
3413	Dealt on lieutenantry, and no practise had
3414	In the brave squares of war: yet now--No matter.
3415	
3416	CLEOPATRA	Ah, stand by.
3417	
3418	EROS	The queen, my lord, the queen.
3419	
3420	IRAS	Go to him, madam, speak to him:
3421	He is unqualitied with very shame.
3422	
3423	CLEOPATRA	Well then, sustain him: O!
3424	
3425	EROS	Most noble sir, arise; the queen approaches:
3426	Her head's declined, and death will seize her, but
3427	Your comfort makes the rescue.
3428	
3429	MARK ANTONY	I have offended reputation,
3430	A most unnoble swerving.
3431	
3432	EROS	Sir, the queen.
3433	
3434	MARK ANTONY	O, whither hast thou led me, Egypt? See,
3435	How I convey my shame out of thine eyes
3436	By looking back what I have left behind
3437	'Stroy'd in dishonour.
3438	
3439	CLEOPATRA	O my lord, my lord,
3440	Forgive my fearful sails! I little thought
3441	You would have follow'd.
3442	
3443	MARK ANTONY	Egypt, thou knew'st too well
3444	My heart was to thy rudder tied by the strings,
3445	And thou shouldst tow me after: o'er my spirit
3446	Thy full supremacy thou knew'st, and that
3447	Thy beck might from the bidding of the gods
3448	Command me.
3449	
3450	CLEOPATRA	          O, my pardon!
3451	
3452	MARK ANTONY	Now I must
3453	To the young man send humble treaties, dodge
3454	And palter in the shifts of lowness; who
3455	With half the bulk o' the world play'd as I pleased,
3456	Making and marring fortunes. You did know
3457	How much you were my conqueror; and that
3458	My sword, made weak by my affection, would
3459	Obey it on all cause.
3460	
3461	CLEOPATRA	Pardon, pardon!
3462	
3463	MARK ANTONY	Fall not a tear, I say; one of them rates
3464	All that is won and lost: give me a kiss;
3465	Even this repays me. We sent our schoolmaster;
3466	Is he come back? Love, I am full of lead.
3467	Some wine, within there, and our viands! Fortune knows
3468	We scorn her most when most she offers blows.

3480	
3481	
3482	SCENE XII	Egypt. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
3483	
3484	
3485	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, DOLABELLA, THYREUS, with others]
3486	
3487	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let him appear that's come from Antony.
3488	Know you him?
3489	
3490	DOLABELLA	                  Caesar, 'tis his schoolmaster:
3491	An argument that he is pluck'd, when hither
3492	He sends so poor a pinion off his wing,
3493	Which had superfluous kings for messengers
3494	Not many moons gone by.
3495	
3496	[Enter EUPHRONIUS, ambassador from MARK ANTONY]
3497	
3498	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Approach, and speak.
3499	
3500	EUPHRONIUS	Such as I am, I come from Antony:
3501	I was of late as petty to his ends
3502	As is the morn-dew on the myrtle-leaf
3503	To his grand sea.
3504	
3505	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Be't so: declare thine office.
3506	
3507	EUPHRONIUS	Lord of his fortunes he salutes thee, and
3508	Requires to live in Egypt: which not granted,
3509	He lessens his requests; and to thee sues
3510	To let him breathe between the heavens and earth,
3511	A private man in Athens: this for him.
3512	Next, Cleopatra does confess thy greatness;
3513	Submits her to thy might; and of thee craves
3514	The circle of the Ptolemies for her heirs,
3515	Now hazarded to thy grace.
3516	
3517	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	For Antony,
3518	I have no ears to his request. The queen
3519	Of audience nor desire shall fail, so she
3520	From Egypt drive her all-disgraced friend,
3521	Or take his life there: this if she perform,
3522	She shall not sue unheard. So to them both.
3523	
3524	EUPHRONIUS	Fortune pursue thee!
3525	
3526	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Bring him through the bands.
3527	
3528	[Exit EUPHRONIUS]
3529	
3530	[To THYREUS]  To try eloquence, now 'tis time: dispatch;
3531	From Antony win Cleopatra: promise,
3532	And in our name, what she requires; add more,
3533	From thine invention, offers: women are not
3534	In their best fortunes strong; but want will perjure
3535	The ne'er touch'd vestal: try thy cunning, Thyreus;
3536	Make thine own edict for thy pains, which we
3537	Will answer as a law.
3538	
3539	THYREUS	Caesar, I go.
3540	
3541	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Observe how Antony becomes his flaw,
3542	And what thou think'st his very action speaks
3543	In every power that moves.
3544	
3545	THYREUS	Caesar, I shall.

3560	
3561	
3562	[Enter CLEOPATRA, DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS, CHARMIAN, and IRAS]
3563	
3564	CLEOPATRA	What shall we do, Enobarbus?
3565	
3566	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Think, and die.
3567	
3568	CLEOPATRA	Is Antony or we in fault for this?
3569	
3570	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Antony only, that would make his will
3571	Lord of his reason. What though you fled
3572	From that great face of war, whose several ranges
3573	Frighted each other? why should he follow?
3574	The itch of his affection should not then
3575	Have nick'd his captainship; at such a point,
3576	When half to half the world opposed, he being
3577	The meered question: 'twas a shame no less
3578	Than was his loss, to course your flying flags,
3579	And leave his navy gazing.
3580	
3581	CLEOPATRA	Prithee, peace.
3582	
3583	[Enter MARK ANTONY with EUPHRONIUS, the Ambassador]
3584	
3585	MARK ANTONY	Is that his answer?
3586	
3587	EUPHRONIUS	Ay, my lord.
3588	
3589	MARK ANTONY	The queen shall then have courtesy, so she
3590	Will yield us up.
3591	
3592	EUPHRONIUS	                  He says so.
3593	
3594	MARK ANTONY	Let her know't.
3595	To the boy Caesar send this grizzled head,
3596	And he will fill thy wishes to the brim
3597	With principalities.
3598	
3599	CLEOPATRA	That head, my lord?
3600	
3601	MARK ANTONY	To him again: tell him he wears the rose
3602	Of youth upon him; from which the world should note
3603	Something particular: his coin, ships, legions,
3604	May be a coward's; whose ministers would prevail
3605	Under the service of a child as soon
3606	As i' the command of Caesar: I dare him therefore
3607	To lay his gay comparisons apart,
3608	And answer me declined, sword against sword,
3609	Ourselves alone. I'll write it: follow me.
3610	
3611	[Exeunt MARK ANTONY and EUPHRONIUS]
3612	
3613	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  Yes, like enough, high-battled Caesar will
3614	Unstate his happiness, and be staged to the show,
3615	Against a sworder! I see men's judgments are
3616	A parcel of their fortunes; and things outward
3617	Do draw the inward quality after them,
3618	To suffer all alike. That he should dream,
3619	Knowing all measures, the full Caesar will
3620	Answer his emptiness! Caesar, thou hast subdued
3621	His judgment too.
3622	
3623	[Enter an Attendant]
3624	
3625	Attendant	                  A messenger from CAESAR.
3626	
3627	CLEOPATRA	What, no more ceremony? See, my women!
3628	Against the blown rose may they stop their nose
3629	That kneel'd unto the buds. Admit him, sir.
3630	
3631	[Exit Attendant]
3632	
3633	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  Mine honesty and I begin to square.
3634	The loyalty well held to fools does make
3635	Our faith mere folly: yet he that can endure
3636	To follow with allegiance a fall'n lord
3637	Does conquer him that did his master conquer
3638	And earns a place i' the story.
3639	
3640	[Enter THYREUS]
3641	
3642	CLEOPATRA	Caesar's will?
3643	
3644	THYREUS	Hear it apart.
3645	
3646	CLEOPATRA	                  None but friends: say boldly.
3647	
3648	THYREUS	So, haply, are they friends to Antony.
3649	
3650	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	He needs as many, sir, as Caesar has;
3651	Or needs not us. If Caesar please, our master
3652	Will leap to be his friend: for us, you know,
3653	Whose he is we are, and that is, Caesar's.
3654	
3655	THYREUS	So.
3656	Thus then, thou most renown'd: Caesar entreats,
3657	Not to consider in what case thou stand'st,
3658	Further than he is Caesar.
3659	
3660	CLEOPATRA	Go on: right royal.
3661	
3662	THYREUS	He knows that you embrace not Antony
3663	As you did love, but as you fear'd him.
3664	
3665	CLEOPATRA	O!
3666	
3667	THYREUS	The scars upon your honour, therefore, he
3668	Does pity, as constrained blemishes,
3669	Not as deserved.
3670	
3671	CLEOPATRA	                  He is a god, and knows
3672	What is most right: mine honour was not yielded,
3673	But conquer'd merely.
3674	
3675	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]             To be sure of that,
3676	I will ask Antony. Sir, sir, thou art so leaky,
3677	That we must leave thee to thy sinking, for
3678	Thy dearest quit thee.
3679	
3680	[Exit]
3681	
3682	THYREUS	Shall I say to Caesar
3683	What you require of him? for he partly begs
3684	To be desired to give. It much would please him,
3685	That of his fortunes you should make a staff
3686	To lean upon: but it would warm his spirits,
3687	To hear from me you had left Antony,
3688	And put yourself under his shrowd,
3689	The universal landlord.
3690	
3691	CLEOPATRA	What's your name?
3692	
3693	THYREUS	My name is Thyreus.
3694	
3695	CLEOPATRA	Most kind messenger,
3696	Say to great Caesar this: in deputation
3697	I kiss his conquering hand: tell him, I am prompt
3698	To lay my crown at 's feet, and there to kneel:
3699	Tell him from his all-obeying breath I hear
3700	The doom of Egypt.
3701	
3702	THYREUS	'Tis your noblest course.
3703	Wisdom and fortune combating together,
3704	If that the former dare but what it can,
3705	No chance may shake it. Give me grace to lay
3706	My duty on your hand.
3707	
3708	CLEOPATRA	Your Caesar's father oft,
3709	When he hath mused of taking kingdoms in,
3710	Bestow'd his lips on that unworthy place,
3711	As it rain'd kisses.
3712	
3713	[Re-enter MARK ANTONY and DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
3714	
3715	MARK ANTONY	Favours, by Jove that thunders!
3716	What art thou, fellow?
3717	
3718	THYREUS	One that but performs
3719	The bidding of the fullest man, and worthiest
3720	To have command obey'd.
3721	
3722	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]               You will be whipp'd.
3723	
3724	MARK ANTONY	Approach, there! Ah, you kite! Now, gods
3725	and devils!
3726	Authority melts from me: of late, when I cried 'Ho!'
3727	Like boys unto a muss, kings would start forth,
3728	And cry 'Your will?' Have you no ears? I am
3729	Antony yet.
3730	
3731	[Enter Attendants]
3732	
3733	Take hence this Jack, and whip him.
3734	
3735	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside]  'Tis better playing with a lion's whelp
3736	Than with an old one dying.
3737	
3738	MARK ANTONY	Moon and stars!
3739	Whip him. Were't twenty of the greatest tributaries
3740	That do acknowledge Caesar, should I find them
3741	So saucy with the hand of she here,--what's her name,
3742	Since she was Cleopatra? Whip him, fellows,
3743	Till, like a boy, you see him cringe his face,
3744	And whine aloud for mercy: take him hence.
3745	
3746	THYREUS	Mark Antony!
3747	
3748	
3749	MARK ANTONY	                  Tug him away: being whipp'd,
3750	Bring him again: this Jack of Caesar's shall
3751	Bear us an errand to him.
3752	
3753	[Exeunt Attendants with THYREUS]
3754	
3755	You were half blasted ere I knew you: ha!
3756	Have I my pillow left unpress'd in Rome,
3757	Forborne the getting of a lawful race,
3758	And by a gem of women, to be abused
3759	By one that looks on feeders?
3760	
3761	CLEOPATRA	Good my lord,--
3762	
3763	MARK ANTONY	You have been a boggler ever:
3764	But when we in our viciousness grow hard--
3765	O misery on't!--the wise gods seel our eyes;
3766	In our own filth drop our clear judgments; make us
3767	Adore our errors; laugh at's, while we strut
3768	To our confusion.
3769	
3770	CLEOPATRA	                  O, is't come to this?
3771	
3772	MARK ANTONY	I found you as a morsel cold upon
3773	Dead Caesar's trencher; nay, you were a fragment
3774	Of Cneius Pompey's; besides what hotter hours,
3775	Unregister'd in vulgar fame, you have
3776	Luxuriously pick'd out: for, I am sure,
3777	Though you can guess what temperance should be,
3778	You know not what it is.
3779	
3780	CLEOPATRA	Wherefore is this?
3781	
3782	MARK ANTONY	To let a fellow that will take rewards
3783	And say 'God quit you!' be familiar with
3784	My playfellow, your hand; this kingly seal
3785	And plighter of high hearts! O, that I were
3786	Upon the hill of Basan, to outroar
3787	The horned herd! for I have savage cause;
3788	And to proclaim it civilly, were like
3789	A halter'd neck which does the hangman thank
3790	For being yare about him.
3791	
3792	[Re-enter Attendants with THYREUS]
3793	
3794	Is he whipp'd?
3795	
3796	First Attendant	Soundly, my lord.
3797	
3798	MARK ANTONY	                  Cried he? and begg'd a' pardon?
3799	
3800	First Attendant	He did ask favour.
3801	
3802	MARK ANTONY	If that thy father live, let him repent
3803	Thou wast not made his daughter; and be thou sorry
3804	To follow Caesar in his triumph, since
3805	Thou hast been whipp'd for following him: henceforth
3806	The white hand of a lady fever thee,
3807	Shake thou to look on 't. Get thee back to Caesar,
3808	Tell him thy entertainment: look, thou say
3809	He makes me angry with him; for he seems
3810	Proud and disdainful, harping on what I am,
3811	Not what he knew I was: he makes me angry;
3812	And at this time most easy 'tis to do't,
3813	When my good stars, that were my former guides,
3814	Have empty left their orbs, and shot their fires
3815	Into the abysm of hell. If he mislike
3816	My speech and what is done, tell him he has
3817	Hipparchus, my enfranched bondman, whom
3818	He may at pleasure whip, or hang, or torture,
3819	As he shall like, to quit me: urge it thou:
3820	Hence with thy stripes, begone!
3821	
3822	[Exit THYREUS]
3823	
3824	CLEOPATRA	Have you done yet?
3825	
3826	MARK ANTONY	                  Alack, our terrene moon
3827	Is now eclipsed; and it portends alone
3828	The fall of Antony!
3829	
3830	CLEOPATRA	I must stay his time.
3831	
3832	MARK ANTONY	To flatter Caesar, would you mingle eyes
3833	With one that ties his points?
3834	
3835	CLEOPATRA	Not know me yet?
3836	
3837	MARK ANTONY	Cold-hearted toward me?
3838	
3839	CLEOPATRA	Ah, dear, if I be so,
3840	From my cold heart let heaven engender hail,
3841	And poison it in the source; and the first stone
3842	Drop in my neck: as it determines, so
3843	Dissolve my life! The next Caesarion smite!
3844	Till by degrees the memory of my womb,
3845	Together with my brave Egyptians all,
3846	By the discandying of this pelleted storm,
3847	Lie graveless, till the flies and gnats of Nile
3848	Have buried them for prey!
3849	
3850	MARK ANTONY	I am satisfied.
3851	Caesar sits down in Alexandria; where
3852	I will oppose his fate. Our force by land
3853	Hath nobly held; our sever'd navy too
3854	Have knit again, and fleet, threatening most sea-like.
3855	Where hast thou been, my heart? Dost thou hear, lady?
3856	If from the field I shall return once more
3857	To kiss these lips, I will appear in blood;
3858	I and my sword will earn our chronicle:
3859	There's hope in't yet.
3860	
3861	CLEOPATRA	That's my brave lord!
3862	
3863	MARK ANTONY	I will be treble-sinew'd, hearted, breathed,
3864	And fight maliciously: for when mine hours
3865	Were nice and lucky, men did ransom lives
3866	Of me for jests; but now I'll set my teeth,
3867	And send to darkness all that stop me. Come,
3868	Let's have one other gaudy night: call to me
3869	All my sad captains; fill our bowls once more;
3870	Let's mock the midnight bell.
3871	
3872	CLEOPATRA	It is my birth-day:
3873	I had thought to have held it poor: but, since my lord
3874	Is Antony again, I will be Cleopatra.
3875	
3876	MARK ANTONY	We will yet do well.
3877	
3878	CLEOPATRA	Call all his noble captains to my lord.
3879	
3880	MARK ANTONY	Do so, we'll speak to them; and to-night I'll force
3881	The wine peep through their scars. Come on, my queen;
3882	There's sap in't yet. The next time I do fight,
3883	I'll make death love me; for I will contend
3884	Even with his pestilent scythe.
3885	
3886	[Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
3887	
3888	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Now he'll outstare the lightning. To be furious,
3889	Is to be frighted out of fear; and in that mood
3890	The dove will peck the estridge; and I see still,
3891	A diminution in our captain's brain
3892	Restores his heart: when valour preys on reason,
3893	It eats the sword it fights with. I will seek
3894	Some way to leave him.

3911	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, and MECAENAS, with
3912	his Army; OCTAVIUS CAESAR reading a letter]
3913	
3914	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	He calls me boy; and chides, as he had power
3915	To beat me out of Egypt; my messenger
3916	He hath whipp'd with rods; dares me to personal combat,
3917	Caesar to Antony: let the old ruffian know
3918	I have many other ways to die; meantime
3919	Laugh at his challenge.
3920	
3921	MECAENAS	Caesar must think,
3922	When one so great begins to rage, he's hunted
3923	Even to falling. Give him no breath, but now
3924	Make boot of his distraction: never anger
3925	Made good guard for itself.
3926	
3927	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let our best heads
3928	Know, that to-morrow the last of many battles
3929	We mean to fight: within our files there are,
3930	Of those that served Mark Antony but late,
3931	Enough to fetch him in. See it done:
3932	And feast the army; we have store to do't,
3933	And they have earn'd the waste. Poor Antony!

3951	CHARMIAN, IRAS, ALEXAS, with others]
3952	
3953	MARK ANTONY	He will not fight with me, Domitius.
3954	
3955	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	No.
3956	
3957	MARK ANTONY	Why should he not?
3958	
3959	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	He thinks, being twenty times of better fortune,
3960	He is twenty men to one.
3961	
3962	MARK ANTONY	To-morrow, soldier,
3963	By sea and land I'll fight: or I will live,
3964	Or bathe my dying honour in the blood
3965	Shall make it live again. Woo't thou fight well?
3966	
3967	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I'll strike, and cry 'Take all.'
3968	
3969	MARK ANTONY	Well said; come on.
3970	Call forth my household servants: let's to-night
3971	Be bounteous at our meal.
3972	
3973	[Enter three or four Servitors]
3974	
3975	Give me thy hand,
3976	Thou hast been rightly honest;--so hast thou;--
3977	Thou,--and thou,--and thou:--you have served me well,
3978	And kings have been your fellows.
3979	
3980	CLEOPATRA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What means this?
3981	
3982	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  'Tis one of those odd
3983	tricks which sorrow shoots
3984	Out of the mind.
3985	
3986	MARK ANTONY	                  And thou art honest too.
3987	I wish I could be made so many men,
3988	And all of you clapp'd up together in
3989	An Antony, that I might do you service
3990	So good as you have done.
3991	
3992	All	The gods forbid!
3993	
3994	MARK ANTONY	Well, my good fellows, wait on me to-night:
3995	Scant not my cups; and make as much of me
3996	As when mine empire was your fellow too,
3997	And suffer'd my command.
3998	
3999	CLEOPATRA	[Aside to DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]  What does he mean?
4000	
4001	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	[Aside to CLEOPATRA]  To make his followers weep.
4002	
4003	MARK ANTONY	Tend me to-night;
4004	May be it is the period of your duty:
4005	Haply you shall not see me more; or if,
4006	A mangled shadow: perchance to-morrow
4007	You'll serve another master. I look on you
4008	As one that takes his leave. Mine honest friends,
4009	I turn you not away; but, like a master
4010	Married to your good service, stay till death:
4011	Tend me to-night two hours, I ask no more,
4012	And the gods yield you for't!
4013	
4014	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	What mean you, sir,
4015	To give them this discomfort? Look, they weep;
4016	And I, an ass, am onion-eyed: for shame,
4017	Transform us not to women.
4018	
4019	MARK ANTONY	Ho, ho, ho!
4020	Now the witch take me, if I meant it thus!
4021	Grace grow where those drops fall!
4022	My hearty friends,
4023	You take me in too dolorous a sense;
4024	For I spake to you for your comfort; did desire you
4025	To burn this night with torches: know, my hearts,
4026	I hope well of to-morrow; and will lead you
4027	Where rather I'll expect victorious life
4028	Than death and honour. Let's to supper, come,
4029	And drown consideration.

4049	
4050	Second Soldier	It will determine one way: fare you well.
4051	Heard you of nothing strange about the streets?
4052	
4053	First Soldier	Nothing. What news?
4054	
4055	Second Soldier	Belike 'tis but a rumour. Good night to you.
4056	
4057	First Soldier	Well, sir, good night.
4058	
4059	[Enter two other Soldiers]
4060	
4061	Second Soldier	Soldiers, have careful watch.
4062	
4063	Third Soldier	And you. Good night, good night.
4064	
4065	[They place themselves in every corner of the stage]
4066	
4067	Fourth Soldier	Here we: and if to-morrow
4068	Our navy thrive, I have an absolute hope
4069	Our landmen will stand up.
4070	
4071	Third Soldier	'Tis a brave army,
4072	And full of purpose.
4073	
4074	[Music of the hautboys as under the stage]
4075	
4076	Fourth Soldier	Peace! what noise?
4077	
4078	First Soldier	List, list!
4079	
4080	Second Soldier	Hark!

4082	First Soldier	    Music i' the air.

4084	Third Soldier	Under the earth.
4085	
4086	Fourth Soldier	It signs well, does it not?
4087	
4088	Third Soldier	No.
4089	
4090	First Soldier	Peace, I say!
4091	What should this mean?
4092	
4093	Second Soldier	'Tis the god Hercules, whom Antony loved,
4094	Now leaves him.
4095	
4096	First Soldier	Walk; let's see if other watchmen
4097	Do hear what we do?
4098	
4099	[They advance to another post]
4100	
4101	Second Soldier	How now, masters!
4102	
4103	All	[Speaking together]  How now!
4104	How now! do you hear this?
4105	
4106	First Soldier	Ay; is't not strange?
4107	
4108	Third Soldier	Do you hear, masters? do you hear?
4109	
4110	First Soldier	Follow the noise so far as we have quarter;

4136	
4137	MARK ANTONY	No, my chuck. Eros, come; mine armour, Eros!
4138	
4139	[Enter EROS with armour]
4140	
4141	Come good fellow, put mine iron on:
4142	If fortune be not ours to-day, it is
4143	Because we brave her: come.
4144	
4145	CLEOPATRA	Nay, I'll help too.
4146	What's this for?
4147	
4148	MARK ANTONY	                  Ah, let be, let be! thou art
4149	The armourer of my heart: false, false; this, this.
4150	
4151	CLEOPATRA	Sooth, la, I'll help: thus it must be.
4152	
4153	MARK ANTONY	Well, well;
4154	We shall thrive now. Seest thou, my good fellow?
4155	Go put on thy defences.
4156	
4157	EROS	Briefly, sir.
4158	
4159	CLEOPATRA	Is not this buckled well?
4160	
4161	MARK ANTONY	Rarely, rarely:
4162	He that unbuckles this, till we do please
4163	To daff't for our repose, shall hear a storm.
4164	Thou fumblest, Eros; and my queen's a squire
4165	More tight at this than thou: dispatch. O love,
4166	That thou couldst see my wars to-day, and knew'st
4167	The royal occupation! thou shouldst see
4168	A workman in't.
4169	
4170	[Enter an armed Soldier]
4171	
4172	Good morrow to thee; welcome:
4173	Thou look'st like him that knows a warlike charge:
4174	To business that we love we rise betime,
4175	And go to't with delight.
4176	
4177	Soldier	A thousand, sir,
4178	Early though't be, have on their riveted trim,
4179	And at the port expect you.

4188	
4189	MARK ANTONY	'Tis well blown, lads:
4190	This morning, like the spirit of a youth
4191	That means to be of note, begins betimes.
4192	So, so; come, give me that: this way; well said.
4193	Fare thee well, dame, whate'er becomes of me:
4194	This is a soldier's kiss: rebukeable
4195	
4196	[Kisses her]
4197	
4198	And worthy shameful cheque it were, to stand
4199	On more mechanic compliment; I'll leave thee
4200	Now, like a man of steel. You that will fight,
4201	Follow me close; I'll bring you to't. Adieu.

4231	
4232	MARK ANTONY	Would thou and those thy scars had once prevail'd
4233	To make me fight at land!
4234	
4235	Soldier	Hadst thou done so,
4236	The kings that have revolted, and the soldier
4237	That has this morning left thee, would have still
4238	Follow'd thy heels.
4239	
4240	MARK ANTONY	Who's gone this morning?
4241	
4242	Soldier	Who!
4243	One ever near thee: call for Enobarbus,
4244	He shall not hear thee; or from Caesar's camp
4245	Say 'I am none of thine.'
4246	
4247	MARK ANTONY	What say'st thou?
4248	
4249	Soldier	Sir,
4250	He is with Caesar.
4251	
4252	EROS	                  Sir, his chests and treasure
4253	He has not with him.
4254	
4255	MARK ANTONY	Is he gone?
4256	
4257	Soldier	Most certain.
4258	
4259	MARK ANTONY	Go, Eros, send his treasure after; do it;
4260	Detain no jot, I charge thee: write to him--
4261	I will subscribe--gentle adieus and greetings;
4262	Say that I wish he never find more cause

4287	
4288	AGRIPPA	Caesar, I shall.
4289	
4290	[Exit]
4291	
4292	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	The time of universal peace is near:
4293	Prove this a prosperous day, the three-nook'd world
4294	Shall bear the olive freely.
4295	
4296	[Enter a Messenger]
4297	
4298	Messenger	Antony
4299	Is come into the field.
4300	
4301	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Go charge Agrippa
4302	Plant those that have revolted in the van,
4303	That Antony may seem to spend his fury
4304	Upon himself.
4305	
4306	[Exeunt all but DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
4307	
4308	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Alexas did revolt; and went to Jewry on
4309	Affairs of Antony; there did persuade
4310	Great Herod to incline himself to Caesar,
4311	And leave his master Antony: for this pains
4312	Caesar hath hang'd him. Canidius and the rest
4313	That fell away have entertainment, but
4314	No honourable trust. I have done ill;
4315	Of which I do accuse myself so sorely,
4316	That I will joy no more.
4317	
4318	[Enter a Soldier of CAESAR's]
4319	
4320	Soldier	Enobarbus, Antony
4321	Hath after thee sent all thy treasure, with
4322	His bounty overplus: the messenger
4323	Came on my guard; and at thy tent is now
4324	Unloading of his mules.
4325	
4326	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I give it you.
4327	
4328	Soldier	Mock not, Enobarbus.
4329	I tell you true: best you safed the bringer
4330	Out of the host; I must attend mine office,
4331	Or would have done't myself. Your emperor
4332	Continues still a Jove.
4333	
4334	[Exit]
4335	
4336	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	I am alone the villain of the earth,
4337	And feel I am so most. O Antony,
4338	Thou mine of bounty, how wouldst thou have paid
4339	My better service, when my turpitude
4340	Thou dost so crown with gold! This blows my heart:
4341	If swift thought break it not, a swifter mean
4342	Shall outstrike thought: but thought will do't, I feel.
4343	I fight against thee! No: I will go seek
4344	Some ditch wherein to die; the foul'st best fits
4345	My latter part of life.

4372	
4373	SCARUS	O my brave emperor, this is fought indeed!
4374	Had we done so at first, we had droven them home
4375	With clouts about their heads.
4376	
4377	MARK ANTONY	Thou bleed'st apace.
4378	
4379	SCARUS	I had a wound here that was like a T,
4380	But now 'tis made an H.
4381	
4382	MARK ANTONY	They do retire.
4383	
4384	SCARUS	We'll beat 'em into bench-holes: I have yet
4385	Room for six scotches more.
4386	
4387	[Enter EROS]
4388	
4389	EROS	They are beaten, sir, and our advantage serves
4390	For a fair victory.
4391	
4392	SCARUS	Let us score their backs,
4393	And snatch 'em up, as we take hares, behind:
4394	'Tis sport to maul a runner.
4395	
4396	MARK ANTONY	I will reward thee
4397	Once for thy spritely comfort, and ten-fold
4398	For thy good valour. Come thee on.

4421	And let the queen know of our gests. To-morrow,
4422	Before the sun shall see 's, we'll spill the blood
4423	That has to-day escaped. I thank you all;
4424	For doughty-handed are you, and have fought
4425	Not as you served the cause, but as 't had been
4426	Each man's like mine; you have shown all Hectors.
4427	Enter the city, clip your wives, your friends,
4428	Tell them your feats; whilst they with joyful tears
4429	Wash the congealment from your wounds, and kiss
4430	The honour'd gashes whole.
4431	
4432	[To SCARUS]
4433	
4434	Give me thy hand
4435	
4436	[Enter CLEOPATRA, attended]
4437	
4438	To this great fairy I'll commend thy acts,
4439	Make her thanks bless thee.
4440	
4441	[To CLEOPATRA]
4442	
4443	O thou day o' the world,
4444	Chain mine arm'd neck; leap thou, attire and all,
4445	Through proof of harness to my heart, and there
4446	Ride on the pants triumphing!
4447	
4448	CLEOPATRA	Lord of lords!
4449	O infinite virtue, comest thou smiling from
4450	The world's great snare uncaught?
4451	
4452	MARK ANTONY	My nightingale,
4453	We have beat them to their beds. What, girl!
4454	though grey
4455	Do something mingle with our younger brown, yet ha' we
4456	A brain that nourishes our nerves, and can
4457	Get goal for goal of youth. Behold this man;
4458	Commend unto his lips thy favouring hand:
4459	Kiss it, my warrior: he hath fought to-day
4460	As if a god, in hate of mankind, had
4461	Destroy'd in such a shape.
4462	
4463	CLEOPATRA	I'll give thee, friend,
4464	An armour all of gold; it was a king's.
4465	
4466	MARK ANTONY	He has deserved it, were it carbuncled
4467	Like holy Phoebus' car. Give me thy hand:
4468	Through Alexandria make a jolly march;
4469	Bear our hack'd targets like the men that owe them:
4470	Had our great palace the capacity
4471	To camp this host, we all would sup together,
4472	And drink carouses to the next day's fate,
4473	Which promises royal peril. Trumpeters,
4474	With brazen din blast you the city's ear;
4475	Make mingle with rattling tabourines;
4476	That heaven and earth may strike their sounds together,
4477	Applauding our approach.

4493	
4494	[Sentinels at their post]
4495	
4496	First Soldier	If we be not relieved within this hour,
4497	We must return to the court of guard: the night
4498	Is shiny; and they say we shall embattle
4499	By the second hour i' the morn.
4500	
4501	Second Soldier	This last day was
4502	A shrewd one to's.
4503	
4504	[Enter DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS]
4505	
4506	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	                  O, bear me witness, night,--
4507	
4508	Third Soldier	What man is this?
4509	
4510	Second Soldier	                  Stand close, and list him.
4511	
4512	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	Be witness to me, O thou blessed moon,
4513	When men revolted shall upon record
4514	Bear hateful memory, poor Enobarbus did
4515	Before thy face repent!
4516	
4517	First Soldier	Enobarbus!
4518	
4519	Third Soldier	Peace!
4520	Hark further.
4521	
4522	DOMITIUS ENOBARBUS	O sovereign mistress of true melancholy,
4523	The poisonous damp of night disponge upon me,
4524	That life, a very rebel to my will,
4525	May hang no longer on me: throw my heart
4526	Against the flint and hardness of my fault:
4527	Which, being dried with grief, will break to powder,
4528	And finish all foul thoughts. O Antony,
4529	Nobler than my revolt is infamous,
4530	Forgive me in thine own particular;
4531	But let the world rank me in register
4532	A master-leaver and a fugitive:
4533	O Antony! O Antony!
4534	
4535	[Dies]
4536	
4537	Second Soldier	Let's speak To him.
4538	
4539	First Soldier	Let's hear him, for the things he speaks
4540	May concern Caesar.
4541	
4542	Third Soldier	Let's do so. But he sleeps.
4543	
4544	First Soldier	Swoons rather; for so bad a prayer as his
4545	Was never yet for sleep.
4546	
4547	Second Soldier	Go we to him.
4548	
4549	Third Soldier	Awake, sir, awake; speak to us.
4550	
4551	Second Soldier	Hear you, sir?
4552	
4553	First Soldier	The hand of death hath raught him.
4554	
4555	[Drums afar off]
4556	
4557	Hark! the drums
4558	Demurely wake the sleepers. Let us bear him
4559	To the court of guard; he is of note: our hour
4560	Is fully out.
4561	
4562	Third Soldier	Come on, then;
4563	He may recover yet.

4584	
4585	SCARUS	For both, my lord.
4586	
4587	MARK ANTONY	I would they'ld fight i' the fire or i' the air;
4588	We'ld fight there too. But this it is; our foot
4589	Upon the hills adjoining to the city
4590	Shall stay with us: order for sea is given;
4591	They have put forth the haven [           ]

4610	
4611	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	But being charged, we will be still by land,
4612	Which, as I take't, we shall; for his best force

4634	I shall discover all: I'll bring thee word
4635	Straight, how 'tis like to go.
4636	
4637	[Exit]
4638	
4639	SCARUS	Swallows have built
4640	In Cleopatra's sails their nests: the augurers
4641	Say they know not, they cannot tell; look grimly,
4642	And dare not speak their knowledge. Antony
4643	Is valiant, and dejected; and, by starts,
4644	His fretted fortunes give him hope, and fear,
4645	Of what he has, and has not.

4648	
4649	[Re-enter MARK ANTONY]
4650	
4651	MARK ANTONY	All is lost;
4652	This foul Egyptian hath betrayed me:
4653	My fleet hath yielded to the foe; and yonder
4654	They cast their caps up and carouse together
4655	Like friends long lost. Triple-turn'd whore!
4656	'tis thou
4657	Hast sold me to this novice; and my heart
4658	Makes only wars on thee. Bid them all fly;
4659	For when I am revenged upon my charm,
4660	I have done all. Bid them all fly; begone.
4661	
4662	[Exit SCARUS]
4663	
4664	O sun, thy uprise shall I see no more:
4665	Fortune and Antony part here; even here
4666	Do we shake hands. All come to this? The hearts
4667	That spaniel'd me at heels, to whom I gave
4668	Their wishes, do discandy, melt their sweets
4669	On blossoming Caesar; and this pine is bark'd,
4670	That overtopp'd them all. Betray'd I am:
4671	O this false soul of Egypt! this grave charm,--
4672	Whose eye beck'd forth my wars, and call'd them home;
4673	Whose bosom was my crownet, my chief end,--
4674	Like a right gipsy, hath, at fast and loose,
4675	Beguiled me to the very heart of loss.
4676	What, Eros, Eros!
4677	
4678	[Enter CLEOPATRA]
4679	
4680	Ah, thou spell! Avaunt!
4681	
4682	CLEOPATRA	Why is my lord enraged against his love?
4683	
4684	MARK ANTONY	Vanish, or I shall give thee thy deserving,
4685	And blemish Caesar's triumph. Let him take thee,
4686	And hoist thee up to the shouting plebeians:
4687	Follow his chariot, like the greatest spot
4688	Of all thy sex; most monster-like, be shown
4689	For poor'st diminutives, for doits; and let
4690	Patient Octavia plough thy visage up
4691	With her prepared nails.
4692	
4693	[Exit CLEOPATRA]
4694	
4695	'Tis well thou'rt gone,
4696	If it be well to live; but better 'twere
4697	Thou fell'st into my fury, for one death
4698	Might have prevented many. Eros, ho!
4699	The shirt of Nessus is upon me: teach me,
4700	Alcides, thou mine ancestor, thy rage:
4701	Let me lodge Lichas on the horns o' the moon;
4702	And with those hands, that grasp'd the heaviest club,
4703	Subdue my worthiest self. The witch shall die:
4704	To the young Roman boy she hath sold me, and I fall
4705	Under this plot; she dies for't. Eros, ho!

4725	Was never so emboss'd.
4726	
4727	CHARMIAN	To the monument!
4728	There lock yourself, and send him word you are dead.
4729	The soul and body rive not more in parting
4730	Than greatness going off.
4731	
4732	CLEOPATRA	To the monument!
4733	Mardian, go tell him I have slain myself;
4734	Say, that the last I spoke was 'Antony,'
4735	And word it, prithee, piteously: hence, Mardian,

4755	
4756	MARK ANTONY	Eros, thou yet behold'st me?
4757	
4758	EROS	Ay, noble lord.
4759	
4760	MARK ANTONY	Sometimes we see a cloud that's dragonish;
4761	A vapour sometime like a bear or lion,
4762	A tower'd citadel, a pendent rock,
4763	A forked mountain, or blue promontory
4764	With trees upon't, that nod unto the world,
4765	And mock our eyes with air: thou hast seen
4766	these signs;
4767	They are black vesper's pageants.
4768	
4769	EROS	Ay, my lord,
4770	
4771	MARK ANTONY	That which is now a horse, even with a thought
4772	The rack dislimns, and makes it indistinct,
4773	As water is in water.
4774	
4775	EROS	It does, my lord.
4776	
4777	MARK ANTONY	My good knave Eros, now thy captain is
4778	Even such a body: here I am Antony:
4779	Yet cannot hold this visible shape, my knave.
4780	I made these wars for Egypt: and the queen,--
4781	Whose heart I thought I had, for she had mine;
4782	Which whilst it was mine had annex'd unto't
4783	A million more, now lost,--she, Eros, has
4784	Pack'd cards with Caesar, and false-play'd my glory
4785	Unto an enemy's triumph.
4786	Nay, weep not, gentle Eros; there is left us
4787	Ourselves to end ourselves.
4788	
4789	[Enter MARDIAN]
4790	
4791	O! thy vile lady!
4792	She has robb'd me of my sword.
4793	
4794	MARDIAN	No, Antony;
4795	My mistress loved thee, and her fortunes mingled
4796	With thine entirely.
4797	
4798	MARK ANTONY	Hence, saucy eunuch; peace!
4799	She hath betray'd me and shall die the death.
4800	
4801	MARDIAN	Death of one person can be paid but once,
4802	And that she has discharged: what thou wouldst do
4803	Is done unto thy hand: the last she spake
4804	Was 'Antony! most noble Antony!'
4805	Then in the midst a tearing groan did break
4806	The name of Antony; it was divided
4807	Between her heart and lips: she render'd life,
4808	Thy name so buried in her.
4809	
4810	MARK ANTONY	Dead, then?
4811	
4812	MARDIAN	Dead.
4813	
4814	MARK ANTONY	Unarm, Eros; the long day's task is done,
4815	And we must sleep.
4816	
4817	[To MARDIAN]
4818	
4819	That thou depart'st hence safe,
4820	Does pay thy labour richly; go.
4821	
4822	[Exit MARDIAN]
4823	
4824	Off, pluck off:
4825	The seven-fold shield of Ajax cannot keep
4826	The battery from my heart. O, cleave, my sides!
4827	Heart, once be stronger than thy continent,
4828	Crack thy frail case! Apace, Eros, apace.
4829	No more a soldier: bruised pieces, go;
4830	You have been nobly borne. From me awhile.
4831	
4832	[Exit EROS]
4833	
4834	I will o'ertake thee, Cleopatra, and
4835	Weep for my pardon. So it must be, for now
4836	All length is torture: since the torch is out,
4837	Lie down, and stray no farther: now all labour
4838	Mars what it does; yea, very force entangles
4839	Itself with strength: seal then, and all is done.
4840	Eros!--I come, my queen:--Eros!--Stay for me:
4841	Where souls do couch on flowers, we'll hand in hand,
4842	And with our sprightly port make the ghosts gaze:
4843	Dido and her AEneas shall want troops,
4844	And all the haunt be ours. Come, Eros, Eros!
4845	
4846	[Re-enter EROS]
4847	
4848	EROS	What would my lord?
4849	
4850	MARK ANTONY	Since Cleopatra died,
4851	I have lived in such dishonour, that the gods
4852	Detest my baseness. I, that with my sword
4853	Quarter'd the world, and o'er green Neptune's back
4854	With ships made cities, condemn myself to lack
4855	The courage of a woman; less noble mind
4856	Than she which by her death our Caesar tells
4857	'I am conqueror of myself.' Thou art sworn, Eros,
4858	That, when the exigent should come, which now
4859	Is come indeed, when I should see behind me
4860	The inevitable prosecution of
4861	Disgrace and horror, that, on my command,
4862	Thou then wouldst kill me: do't; the time is come:
4863	Thou strikest not me, 'tis Caesar thou defeat'st.
4864	Put colour in thy cheek.
4865	
4866	EROS	The gods withhold me!
4867	Shall I do that which all the Parthian darts,
4868	Though enemy, lost aim, and could not?
4869	
4870	MARK ANTONY	Eros,
4871	Wouldst thou be window'd in great Rome and see
4872	Thy master thus with pleach'd arms, bending down
4873	His corrigible neck, his face subdued
4874	To penetrative shame, whilst the wheel'd seat
4875	Of fortunate Caesar, drawn before him, branded
4876	His baseness that ensued?
4877	
4878	EROS	I would not see't.
4879	
4880	MARK ANTONY	Come, then; for with a wound I must be cured.
4881	Draw that thy honest sword, which thou hast worn
4882	Most useful for thy country.
4883	
4884	EROS	O, sir, pardon me!
4885	
4886	MARK ANTONY	When I did make thee free, sworest thou not then
4887	To do this when I bade thee? Do it at once;
4888	Or thy precedent services are all
4889	But accidents unpurposed. Draw, and come.
4890	
4891	EROS	Turn from me, then, that noble countenance,
4892	Wherein the worship of the whole world lies.
4893	
4894	MARK ANTONY	Lo thee!
4895	
4896	[Turning from him]
4897	
4898	EROS	My sword is drawn.
4899	
4900	MARK ANTONY	                  Then let it do at once
4901	The thing why thou hast drawn it.
4902	
4903	EROS	My dear master,
4904	My captain, and my emperor, let me say,
4905	Before I strike this bloody stroke, farewell.
4906	
4907	MARK ANTONY	'Tis said, man; and farewell.
4908	
4909	EROS	Farewell, great chief. Shall I strike now?
4910	
4911	MARK ANTONY	Now, Eros.
4912	
4913	EROS	Why, there then: thus I do escape the sorrow
4914	Of Antony's death.
4915	
4916	[Kills himself]
4917	
4918	MARK ANTONY	                  Thrice-nobler than myself!
4919	Thou teachest me, O valiant Eros, what
4920	I should, and thou couldst not. My queen and Eros
4921	Have by their brave instruction got upon me
4922	A nobleness in record: but I will be
4923	A bridegroom in my death, and run into't
4924	As to a lover's bed. Come, then; and, Eros,
4925	Thy master dies thy scholar: to do thus
4926	
4927	[Falling on his sword]
4928	
4929	I learn'd of thee. How! not dead? not dead?
4930	The guard, ho! O, dispatch me!
4931	
4932	[Enter DERCETAS and Guard]
4933	
4934	First Guard	What's the noise?
4935	
4936	MARK ANTONY	I have done my work in, friends: O, make an end
4937	Of what I have begun.
4938	
4939	Second Guard	The star is fall'n.
4940	
4941	First Guard	And time is at his period.
4942	
4943	All	Alas, and woe!
4944	
4945	MARK ANTONY	Let him that loves me strike me dead.
4946	
4947	First Guard	Not I.
4948	
4949	Second Guard	Nor I.
4950	
4951	Third Guard	Nor any one.
4952	
4953	[Exeunt Guard]
4954	
4955	DERCETAS	Thy death and fortunes bid thy followers fly.
4956	This sword but shown to Caesar, with this tidings,
4957	Shall enter me with him.
4958	
4959	[Enter DIOMEDES]
4960	
4961	DIOMEDES	Where's Antony?
4962	
4963	DERCETAS	                  There, Diomed there.
4964	
4965	DIOMEDES	Lives he?
4966	Wilt thou not answer, man?
4967	
4968	[Exit DERCETAS]
4969	
4970	MARK ANTONY	Art thou there, Diomed? Draw thy sword, and give me
4971	Sufficing strokes for death.
4972	
4973	DIOMEDES	Most absolute lord,
4974	My mistress Cleopatra sent me to thee.
4975	
4976	MARK ANTONY	When did she send thee?
4977	
4978	DIOMEDES	Now, my lord.
4979	
4980	MARK ANTONY	Where is she?
4981	
4982	DIOMEDES	Lock'd in her monument. She had a prophesying fear
4983	Of what hath come to pass: for when she saw--
4984	Which never shall be found--you did suspect
4985	She had disposed with Caesar, and that your rage
4986	Would not be purged, she sent you word she was dead;
4987	But, fearing since how it might work, hath sent
4988	Me to proclaim the truth; and I am come,
4989	I dread, too late.
4990	
4991	MARK ANTONY	Too late, good Diomed: call my guard, I prithee.
4992	
4993	DIOMEDES	What, ho, the emperor's guard! The guard, what, ho!
4994	Come, your lord calls!
4995	
4996	[Enter four or five of the Guard of MARK ANTONY]
4997	
4998	MARK ANTONY	Bear me, good friends, where Cleopatra bides;
4999	'Tis the last service that I shall command you.
5000	
5001	First Guard	Woe, woe are we, sir, you may not live to wear
5002	All your true followers out.
5003	
5004	All	Most heavy day!
5005	
5006	MARK ANTONY	Nay, good my fellows, do not please sharp fate
5007	To grace it with your sorrows: bid that welcome
5008	Which comes to punish us, and we punish it
5009	Seeming to bear it lightly. Take me up:
5010	I have led you oft: carry me now, good friends,
5011	And have my thanks for all.
5012	
5013	[Exeunt, bearing MARK ANTONY]

5018	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
5019	
5020	
5021	ACT IV
5022	
5023	
5024	
5025	SCENE XV	The same. A monument.
5026	
5027	
5028	[Enter CLEOPATRA and her maids aloft, with
5029	CHARMIAN and IRAS]
5030	
5031	CLEOPATRA	O Charmian, I will never go from hence.
5032	
5033	CHARMIAN	Be comforted, dear madam.
5034	
5035	CLEOPATRA	No, I will not:
5036	All strange and terrible events are welcome,
5037	But comforts we despise; our size of sorrow,
5038	Proportion'd to our cause, must be as great
5039	As that which makes it.
5040	
5041	[Enter, below, DIOMEDES]
5042	
5043	How now! is he dead?
5044	
5045	DIOMEDES	His death's upon him, but not dead.
5046	Look out o' the other side your monument;
5047	His guard have brought him thither.
5048	
5049	[Enter, below, MARK ANTONY, borne by the Guard]
5050	
5051	CLEOPATRA	O sun,
5052	Burn the great sphere thou movest in!
5053	darkling stand
5054	The varying shore o' the world. O Antony,
5055	Antony, Antony! Help, Charmian, help, Iras, help;
5056	Help, friends below; let's draw him hither.
5057	
5058	MARK ANTONY	Peace!
5059	Not Caesar's valour hath o'erthrown Antony,
5060	But Antony's hath triumph'd on itself.
5061	
5062	CLEOPATRA	So it should be, that none but Antony
5063	Should conquer Antony; but woe 'tis so!
5064	
5065	MARK ANTONY	I am dying, Egypt, dying; only
5066	I here importune death awhile, until
5067	Of many thousand kisses the poor last
5068	I lay up thy lips.
5069	
5070	CLEOPATRA	                  I dare not, dear,--
5071	Dear my lord, pardon,--I dare not,
5072	Lest I be taken: not the imperious show
5073	Of the full-fortuned Caesar ever shall
5074	Be brooch'd with me; if knife, drugs,
5075	serpents, have
5076	Edge, sting, or operation, I am safe:
5077	Your wife Octavia, with her modest eyes
5078	And still conclusion, shall acquire no honour
5079	Demuring upon me. But come, come, Antony,--
5080	Help me, my women,--we must draw thee up:
5081	Assist, good friends.
5082	
5083	MARK ANTONY	O, quick, or I am gone.
5084	
5085	CLEOPATRA	Here's sport indeed! How heavy weighs my lord!
5086	Our strength is all gone into heaviness,
5087	That makes the weight: had I great Juno's power,
5088	The strong-wing'd Mercury should fetch thee up,
5089	And set thee by Jove's side. Yet come a little,--
5090	Wishes were ever fools,--O, come, come, come;
5091	
5092	[They heave MARK ANTONY aloft to CLEOPATRA]
5093	
5094	And welcome, welcome! die where thou hast lived:
5095	Quicken with kissing: had my lips that power,
5096	Thus would I wear them out.
5097	
5098	All	A heavy sight!
5099	
5100	MARK ANTONY	I am dying, Egypt, dying:
5101	Give me some wine, and let me speak a little.
5102	
5103	CLEOPATRA	No, let me speak; and let me rail so high,
5104	That the false housewife Fortune break her wheel,
5105	Provoked by my offence.
5106	
5107	MARK ANTONY	One word, sweet queen:
5108	Of Caesar seek your honour, with your safety. O!
5109	
5110	CLEOPATRA	They do not go together.
5111	
5112	MARK ANTONY	Gentle, hear me:
5113	None about Caesar trust but Proculeius.
5114	
5115	CLEOPATRA	My resolution and my hands I'll trust;
5116	None about Caesar.
5117	
5118	MARK ANTONY	The miserable change now at my end
5119	Lament nor sorrow at; but please your thoughts
5120	In feeding them with those my former fortunes
5121	Wherein I lived, the greatest prince o' the world,
5122	The noblest; and do now not basely die,
5123	Not cowardly put off my helmet to
5124	My countryman,--a Roman by a Roman
5125	Valiantly vanquish'd. Now my spirit is going;
5126	I can no more.
5127	
5128	CLEOPATRA	                  Noblest of men, woo't die?
5129	Hast thou no care of me? shall I abide
5130	In this dull world, which in thy absence is
5131	No better than a sty? O, see, my women,
5132	
5133	[MARK ANTONY dies]
5134	
5135	The crown o' the earth doth melt. My lord!
5136	O, wither'd is the garland of the war,
5137	The soldier's pole is fall'n: young boys and girls
5138	Are level now with men; the odds is gone,
5139	And there is nothing left remarkable
5140	Beneath the visiting moon.
5141	
5142	[Faints]
5143	
5144	CHARMIAN	O, quietness, lady!
5145	
5146	IRAS	She is dead too, our sovereign.
5147	
5148	CHARMIAN	Lady!
5149	
5150	IRAS	Madam!
5151	
5152	CHARMIAN	O madam, madam, madam!
5153	
5154	IRAS	Royal Egypt, Empress!
5155	
5156	CHARMIAN	Peace, peace, Iras!
5157	
5158	CLEOPATRA	No more, but e'en a woman, and commanded
5159	By such poor passion as the maid that milks
5160	And does the meanest chares. It were for me
5161	To throw my sceptre at the injurious gods;
5162	To tell them that this world did equal theirs
5163	Till they had stol'n our jewel. All's but naught;
5164	Patience is scottish, and impatience does
5165	Become a dog that's mad: then is it sin
5166	To rush into the secret house of death,
5167	Ere death dare come to us? How do you, women?
5168	What, what! good cheer! Why, how now, Charmian!
5169	My noble girls! Ah, women, women, look,
5170	Our lamp is spent, it's out! Good sirs, take heart:
5171	We'll bury him; and then, what's brave,
5172	what's noble,
5173	Let's do it after the high Roman fashion,
5174	And make death proud to take us. Come, away:
5175	This case of that huge spirit now is cold:
5176	Ah, women, women! come; we have no friend
5177	But resolution, and the briefest end.
5178	
5179	[Exeunt; those above bearing off MARK ANTONY's body]

5184	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
5185	
5186	
5187	ACT V
5188	
5189	
5190	
5191	SCENE I	Alexandria. OCTAVIUS CAESAR's camp.
5192	
5193	
5194	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, AGRIPPA, DOLABELLA, MECAENAS,
5195	GALLUS, PROCULEIUS, and others, his council of war]
5196	
5197	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Go to him, Dolabella, bid him yield;
5198	Being so frustrate, tell him he mocks
5199	The pauses that he makes.
5200	
5201	DOLABELLA	Caesar, I shall.
5202	
5203	[Exit]
5204	
5205	[Enter DERCETAS, with the sword of MARK ANTONY]
5206	
5207	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Wherefore is that? and what art thou that darest
5208	Appear thus to us?
5209	
5210	DERCETAS	                  I am call'd Dercetas;
5211	Mark Antony I served, who best was worthy
5212	Best to be served: whilst he stood up and spoke,
5213	He was my master; and I wore my life
5214	To spend upon his haters. If thou please
5215	To take me to thee, as I was to him
5216	I'll be to Caesar; if thou pleasest not,
5217	I yield thee up my life.
5218	
5219	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	What is't thou say'st?
5220	
5221	DERCETAS	I say, O Caesar, Antony is dead.
5222	
5223	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	The breaking of so great a thing should make
5224	A greater crack: the round world
5225	Should have shook lions into civil streets,
5226	And citizens to their dens: the death of Antony
5227	Is not a single doom; in the name lay
5228	A moiety of the world.
5229	
5230	DERCETAS	He is dead, Caesar:
5231	Not by a public minister of justice,
5232	Nor by a hired knife; but that self hand,
5233	Which writ his honour in the acts it did,
5234	Hath, with the courage which the heart did lend it,
5235	Splitted the heart. This is his sword;
5236	I robb'd his wound of it; behold it stain'd
5237	With his most noble blood.
5238	
5239	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Look you sad, friends?
5240	The gods rebuke me, but it is tidings
5241	To wash the eyes of kings.
5242	
5243	AGRIPPA	And strange it is,
5244	That nature must compel us to lament
5245	Our most persisted deeds.
5246	
5247	MECAENAS	His taints and honours
5248	Waged equal with him.
5249	
5250	AGRIPPA	A rarer spirit never
5251	Did steer humanity: but you, gods, will give us
5252	Some faults to make us men. Caesar is touch'd.
5253	
5254	MECAENAS	When such a spacious mirror's set before him,
5255	He needs must see himself.
5256	
5257	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	O Antony!
5258	I have follow'd thee to this; but we do lance
5259	Diseases in our bodies: I must perforce
5260	Have shown to thee such a declining day,
5261	Or look on thine; we could not stall together
5262	In the whole world: but yet let me lament,
5263	With tears as sovereign as the blood of hearts,
5264	That thou, my brother, my competitor
5265	In top of all design, my mate in empire,
5266	Friend and companion in the front of war,
5267	The arm of mine own body, and the heart
5268	Where mine his thoughts did kindle,--that our stars,
5269	Unreconciliable, should divide
5270	Our equalness to this. Hear me, good friends--
5271	But I will tell you at some meeter season:
5272	
5273	[Enter an Egyptian]
5274	
5275	The business of this man looks out of him;
5276	We'll hear him what he says. Whence are you?
5277	
5278	Egyptian	A poor Egyptian yet. The queen my mistress,
5279	Confined in all she has, her monument,
5280	Of thy intents desires instruction,
5281	That she preparedly may frame herself
5282	To the way she's forced to.
5283	
5284	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Bid her have good heart:
5285	She soon shall know of us, by some of ours,
5286	How honourable and how kindly we
5287	Determine for her; for Caesar cannot live
5288	To be ungentle.
5289	
5290	Egyptian	So the gods preserve thee!
5291	
5292	[Exit]
5293	
5294	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Come hither, Proculeius. Go and say,
5295	We purpose her no shame: give her what comforts
5296	The quality of her passion shall require,
5297	Lest, in her greatness, by some mortal stroke
5298	She do defeat us; for her life in Rome
5299	Would be eternal in our triumph: go,
5300	And with your speediest bring us what she says,
5301	And how you find of her.
5302	
5303	PROCULEIUS	Caesar, I shall.
5304	
5305	[Exit]
5306	
5307	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Gallus, go you along.
5308	
5309	[Exit GALLUS]
5310	
5311	Where's Dolabella,
5312	To second Proculeius?
5313	
5314	All	Dolabella!
5315	
5316	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Let him alone, for I remember now
5317	How he's employ'd: he shall in time be ready.
5318	Go with me to my tent; where you shall see
5319	How hardly I was drawn into this war;
5320	How calm and gentle I proceeded still
5321	In all my writings: go with me, and see
5322	What I can show in this.
5323	
5324	[Exeunt]
5325	
5326	
5327	
5328	
5329	ANTONY AND CLEOPATRA
5330	
5331	
5332	ACT V
5333	
5334	
5335	
5336	SCENE II	Alexandria. A room in the monument.
5337	
5338	
5339	[Enter CLEOPATRA, CHARMIAN, and IRAS]
5340	
5341	CLEOPATRA	My desolation does begin to make
5342	A better life. 'Tis paltry to be Caesar;
5343	Not being Fortune, he's but Fortune's knave,
5344	A minister of her will: and it is great
5345	To do that thing that ends all other deeds;
5346	Which shackles accidents and bolts up change;
5347	Which sleeps, and never palates more the dug,
5348	The beggar's nurse and Caesar's.
5349	
5350	[Enter, to the gates of the monument, PROCULEIUS,
5351	GALLUS and Soldiers]
5352	
5353	PROCULEIUS	Caesar sends greeting to the Queen of Egypt;
5354	And bids thee study on what fair demands
5355	Thou mean'st to have him grant thee.
5356	
5357	CLEOPATRA	What's thy name?
5358	
5359	PROCULEIUS	My name is Proculeius.
5360	
5361	CLEOPATRA	Antony
5362	Did tell me of you, bade me trust you; but
5363	I do not greatly care to be deceived,
5364	That have no use for trusting. If your master
5365	Would have a queen his beggar, you must tell him,
5366	That majesty, to keep decorum, must
5367	No less beg than a kingdom: if he please
5368	To give me conquer'd Egypt for my son,
5369	He gives me so much of mine own, as I
5370	Will kneel to him with thanks.
5371	
5372	PROCULEIUS	Be of good cheer;
5373	You're fall'n into a princely hand, fear nothing:
5374	Make your full reference freely to my lord,
5375	Who is so full of grace, that it flows over
5376	On all that need: let me report to him
5377	Your sweet dependency; and you shall find
5378	A conqueror that will pray in aid for kindness,
5379	Where he for grace is kneel'd to.
5380	
5381	CLEOPATRA	Pray you, tell him
5382	I am his fortune's vassal, and I send him
5383	The greatness he has got. I hourly learn
5384	A doctrine of obedience; and would gladly
5385	Look him i' the face.
5386	
5387	PROCULEIUS	This I'll report, dear lady.
5388	Have comfort, for I know your plight is pitied
5389	Of him that caused it.
5390	
5391	GALLUS	You see how easily she may be surprised:
5392	
5393	[Here PROCULEIUS and two of the Guard ascend the
5394	monument by a ladder placed against a window, and,
5395	having descended, come behind CLEOPATRA. Some of
5396	the Guard unbar and open the gates]
5397	
5398	[To PROCULEIUS and the Guard]
5399	
5400	Guard her till Caesar come.
5401	
5402	[Exit]
5403	
5404	IRAS	Royal queen!
5405	
5406	CHARMIAN	O Cleopatra! thou art taken, queen:
5407	
5408	CLEOPATRA	Quick, quick, good hands.
5409	
5410	[Drawing a dagger]
5411	
5412	PROCULEIUS	Hold, worthy lady, hold:
5413	
5414	[Seizes and disarms her]
5415	
5416	Do not yourself such wrong, who are in this
5417	Relieved, but not betray'd.
5418	
5419	CLEOPATRA	What, of death too,
5420	That rids our dogs of languish?
5421	
5422	PROCULEIUS	Cleopatra,
5423	Do not abuse my master's bounty by
5424	The undoing of yourself: let the world see
5425	His nobleness well acted, which your death
5426	Will never let come forth.
5427	
5428	CLEOPATRA	Where art thou, death?
5429	Come hither, come! come, come, and take a queen
5430	Worthy many babes and beggars!
5431	
5432	PROCULEIUS	O, temperance, lady!
5433	
5434	CLEOPATRA	Sir, I will eat no meat, I'll not drink, sir;
5435	If idle talk will once be necessary,
5436	I'll not sleep neither: this mortal house I'll ruin,
5437	Do Caesar what he can. Know, sir, that I
5438	Will not wait pinion'd at your master's court;
5439	Nor once be chastised with the sober eye
5440	Of dull Octavia. Shall they hoist me up
5441	And show me to the shouting varletry
5442	Of censuring Rome? Rather a ditch in Egypt
5443	Be gentle grave unto me! rather on Nilus' mud
5444	Lay me stark naked, and let the water-flies
5445	Blow me into abhorring! rather make
5446	My country's high pyramides my gibbet,
5447	And hang me up in chains!
5448	
5449	PROCULEIUS	You do extend
5450	These thoughts of horror further than you shall
5451	Find cause in Caesar.
5452	
5453	[Enter DOLABELLA]
5454	
5455	DOLABELLA	Proculeius,
5456	What thou hast done thy master Caesar knows,
5457	And he hath sent for thee: for the queen,
5458	I'll take her to my guard.
5459	
5460	PROCULEIUS	So, Dolabella,
5461	It shall content me best: be gentle to her.
5462	
5463	[To CLEOPATRA]
5464	
5465	To Caesar I will speak what you shall please,
5466	If you'll employ me to him.
5467	
5468	CLEOPATRA	Say, I would die.
5469	
5470	[Exeunt PROCULEIUS and Soldiers]
5471	
5472	DOLABELLA	Most noble empress, you have heard of me?
5473	
5474	CLEOPATRA	I cannot tell.
5475	
5476	DOLABELLA	                  Assuredly you know me.
5477	
5478	CLEOPATRA	No matter, sir, what I have heard or known.
5479	You laugh when boys or women tell their dreams;
5480	Is't not your trick?
5481	
5482	DOLABELLA	I understand not, madam.
5483	
5484	CLEOPATRA	I dream'd there was an Emperor Antony:
5485	O, such another sleep, that I might see
5486	But such another man!
5487	
5488	DOLABELLA	If it might please ye,--
5489	
5490	CLEOPATRA	His face was as the heavens; and therein stuck
5491	A sun and moon, which kept their course,
5492	and lighted
5493	The little O, the earth.
5494	
5495	DOLABELLA	Most sovereign creature,--
5496	
5497	CLEOPATRA	His legs bestrid the ocean: his rear'd arm
5498	Crested the world: his voice was propertied
5499	As all the tuned spheres, and that to friends;
5500	But when he meant to quail and shake the orb,
5501	He was as rattling thunder. For his bounty,
5502	There was no winter in't; an autumn 'twas
5503	That grew the more by reaping: his delights
5504	Were dolphin-like; they show'd his back above
5505	The element they lived in: in his livery
5506	Walk'd crowns and crownets; realms and islands were
5507	As plates dropp'd from his pocket.
5508	
5509	DOLABELLA	Cleopatra!
5510	
5511	CLEOPATRA	Think you there was, or might be, such a man
5512	As this I dream'd of?
5513	
5514	DOLABELLA	Gentle madam, no.
5515	
5516	CLEOPATRA	You lie, up to the hearing of the gods.
5517	But, if there be, or ever were, one such,
5518	It's past the size of dreaming: nature wants stuff
5519	To vie strange forms with fancy; yet, to imagine
5520	And Antony, were nature's piece 'gainst fancy,
5521	Condemning shadows quite.
5522	
5523	DOLABELLA	Hear me, good madam.
5524	Your loss is as yourself, great; and you bear it
5525	As answering to the weight: would I might never
5526	O'ertake pursued success, but I do feel,
5527	By the rebound of yours, a grief that smites
5528	My very heart at root.
5529	
5530	CLEOPATRA	I thank you, sir,
5531	Know you what Caesar means to do with me?
5532	
5533	DOLABELLA	I am loath to tell you what I would you knew.
5534	
5535	CLEOPATRA	Nay, pray you, sir,--
5536	
5537	DOLABELLA	Though he be honourable,--
5538	
5539	CLEOPATRA	He'll lead me, then, in triumph?
5540	
5541	DOLABELLA	Madam, he will; I know't.
5542	
5543	[Flourish, and shout within, 'Make way there:
5544	Octavius Caesar!']
5545	
5546	[Enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR, GALLUS, PROCULEIUS,
5547	MECAENAS, SELEUCUS, and others of his Train]
5548	
5549	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Which is the Queen of Egypt?
5550	
5551	DOLABELLA	It is the emperor, madam.
5552	
5553	[CLEOPATRA kneels]
5554	
5555	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Arise, you shall not kneel:
5556	I pray you, rise; rise, Egypt.
5557	
5558	CLEOPATRA	Sir, the gods
5559	Will have it thus; my master and my lord
5560	I must obey.
5561	
5562	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Take to you no hard thoughts:
5563	The record of what injuries you did us,
5564	Though written in our flesh, we shall remember
5565	As things but done by chance.
5566	
5567	CLEOPATRA	Sole sir o' the world,
5568	I cannot project mine own cause so well
5569	To make it clear; but do confess I have
5570	Been laden with like frailties which before
5571	Have often shamed our sex.
5572	
5573	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Cleopatra, know,
5574	We will extenuate rather than enforce:
5575	If you apply yourself to our intents,
5576	Which towards you are most gentle, you shall find
5577	A benefit in this change; but if you seek
5578	To lay on me a cruelty, by taking
5579	Antony's course, you shall bereave yourself
5580	Of my good purposes, and put your children
5581	To that destruction which I'll guard them from,
5582	If thereon you rely. I'll take my leave.
5583	
5584	CLEOPATRA	And may, through all the world: 'tis yours; and we,
5585	Your scutcheons and your signs of conquest, shall
5586	Hang in what place you please. Here, my good lord.
5587	
5588	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	You shall advise me in all for Cleopatra.
5589	
5590	CLEOPATRA	This is the brief of money, plate, and jewels,
5591	I am possess'd of: 'tis exactly valued;
5592	Not petty things admitted. Where's Seleucus?
5593	
5594	SELEUCUS	Here, madam.
5595	
5596	CLEOPATRA	This is my treasurer: let him speak, my lord,
5597	Upon his peril, that I have reserved
5598	To myself nothing. Speak the truth, Seleucus.
5599	
5600	SELEUCUS	Madam,
5601	I had rather seal my lips, than, to my peril,
5602	Speak that which is not.
5603	
5604	CLEOPATRA	What have I kept back?
5605	
5606	SELEUCUS	Enough to purchase what you have made known.
5607	
5608	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Nay, blush not, Cleopatra; I approve
5609	Your wisdom in the deed.
5610	
5611	CLEOPATRA	See, Caesar! O, behold,
5612	How pomp is follow'd! mine will now be yours;
5613	And, should we shift estates, yours would be mine.
5614	The ingratitude of this Seleucus does
5615	Even make me wild: O slave, of no more trust
5616	Than love that's hired! What, goest thou back? thou shalt
5617	Go back, I warrant thee; but I'll catch thine eyes,
5618	Though they had wings: slave, soulless villain, dog!
5619	O rarely base!
5620	
5621	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	                  Good queen, let us entreat you.
5622	
5623	CLEOPATRA	O Caesar, what a wounding shame is this,
5624	That thou, vouchsafing here to visit me,
5625	Doing the honour of thy lordliness
5626	To one so meek, that mine own servant should
5627	Parcel the sum of my disgraces by
5628	Addition of his envy! Say, good Caesar,
5629	That I some lady trifles have reserved,
5630	Immoment toys, things of such dignity
5631	As we greet modern friends withal; and say,
5632	Some nobler token I have kept apart
5633	For Livia and Octavia, to induce
5634	Their mediation; must I be unfolded
5635	With one that I have bred? The gods! it smites me
5636	Beneath the fall I have.
5637	
5638	[To SELEUCUS]
5639	
5640	Prithee, go hence;
5641	Or I shall show the cinders of my spirits
5642	Through the ashes of my chance: wert thou a man,
5643	Thou wouldst have mercy on me.
5644	
5645	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Forbear, Seleucus.
5646	
5647	[Exit SELEUCUS]
5648	
5649	CLEOPATRA	Be it known, that we, the greatest, are misthought
5650	For things that others do; and, when we fall,
5651	We answer others' merits in our name,
5652	Are therefore to be pitied.
5653	
5654	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Cleopatra,
5655	Not what you have reserved, nor what acknowledged,
5656	Put we i' the roll of conquest: still be't yours,
5657	Bestow it at your pleasure; and believe,
5658	Caesar's no merchant, to make prize with you
5659	Of things that merchants sold. Therefore be cheer'd;
5660	Make not your thoughts your prisons: no, dear queen;
5661	For we intend so to dispose you as
5662	Yourself shall give us counsel. Feed, and sleep:
5663	Our care and pity is so much upon you,
5664	That we remain your friend; and so, adieu.
5665	
5666	CLEOPATRA	My master, and my lord!
5667	
5668	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Not so. Adieu.
5669	
5670	[Flourish. Exeunt OCTAVIUS CAESAR and his train]
5671	
5672	CLEOPATRA	He words me, girls, he words me, that I should not
5673	Be noble to myself: but, hark thee, Charmian.
5674	
5675	[Whispers CHARMIAN]
5676	
5677	IRAS	Finish, good lady; the bright day is done,
5678	And we are for the dark.
5679	
5680	CLEOPATRA	Hie thee again:
5681	I have spoke already, and it is provided;
5682	Go put it to the haste.
5683	
5684	CHARMIAN	Madam, I will.
5685	
5686	[Re-enter DOLABELLA]
5687	
5688	DOLABELLA	Where is the queen?
5689	
5690	CHARMIAN	Behold, sir.
5691	
5692	[Exit]
5693	
5694	CLEOPATRA	Dolabella!
5695	
5696	DOLABELLA	Madam, as thereto sworn by your command,
5697	Which my love makes religion to obey,
5698	I tell you this: Caesar through Syria
5699	Intends his journey; and within three days
5700	You with your children will he send before:
5701	Make your best use of this: I have perform'd
5702	Your pleasure and my promise.
5703	
5704	CLEOPATRA	Dolabella,
5705	I shall remain your debtor.
5706	
5707	DOLABELLA	I your servant,
5708	Adieu, good queen; I must attend on Caesar.
5709	
5710	CLEOPATRA	Farewell, and thanks.
5711	
5712	[Exit DOLABELLA]
5713	
5714	Now, Iras, what think'st thou?
5715	Thou, an Egyptian puppet, shalt be shown
5716	In Rome, as well as I	mechanic slaves
5717	With greasy aprons, rules, and hammers, shall
5718	Uplift us to the view; in their thick breaths,
5719	Rank of gross diet, shall be enclouded,
5720	And forced to drink their vapour.
5721	
5722	IRAS	The gods forbid!
5723	
5724	CLEOPATRA	Nay, 'tis most certain, Iras: saucy lictors
5725	Will catch at us, like strumpets; and scald rhymers
5726	Ballad us out o' tune: the quick comedians
5727	Extemporally will stage us, and present
5728	Our Alexandrian revels; Antony
5729	Shall be brought drunken forth, and I shall see
5730	Some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness
5731	I' the posture of a whore.
5732	
5733	IRAS	O the good gods!
5734	
5735	CLEOPATRA	Nay, that's certain.
5736	
5737	IRAS	I'll never see 't; for, I am sure, my nails
5738	Are stronger than mine eyes.
5739	
5740	CLEOPATRA	Why, that's the way
5741	To fool their preparation, and to conquer
5742	Their most absurd intents.
5743	
5744	[Re-enter CHARMIAN]
5745	
5746	Now, Charmian!
5747	Show me, my women, like a queen: go fetch
5748	My best attires: I am again for Cydnus,
5749	To meet Mark Antony: sirrah Iras, go.
5750	Now, noble Charmian, we'll dispatch indeed;
5751	And, when thou hast done this chare, I'll give thee leave
5752	To play till doomsday. Bring our crown and all.
5753	Wherefore's this noise?
5754	
5755	[Exit IRAS. A noise within]
5756	
5757	[Enter a Guardsman]
5758	
5759	Guard	Here is a rural fellow
5760	That will not be denied your highness presence:
5761	He brings you figs.
5762	
5763	CLEOPATRA	Let him come in.
5764	
5765	[Exit Guardsman]
5766	
5767	What poor an instrument
5768	May do a noble deed! he brings me liberty.
5769	My resolution's placed, and I have nothing
5770	Of woman in me: now from head to foot
5771	I am marble-constant; now the fleeting moon
5772	No planet is of mine.
5773	
5774	[Re-enter Guardsman, with Clown bringing in a basket]
5775	
5776	Guard	This is the man.
5777	
5778	CLEOPATRA	Avoid, and leave him.
5779	
5780	[Exit Guardsman]
5781	
5782	Hast thou the pretty worm of Nilus there,
5783	That kills and pains not?
5784	
5785	Clown	Truly, I have him: but I would not be the party
5786	that should desire you to touch him, for his biting
5787	is immortal; those that do die of it do seldom or
5788	never recover.
5789	
5790	CLEOPATRA	Rememberest thou any that have died on't?
5791	
5792	Clown	Very many, men and women too. I heard of one of
5793	them no longer than yesterday: a very honest woman,
5794	but something given to lie; as a woman should not
5795	do, but in the way of honesty: how she died of the
5796	biting of it, what pain she felt: truly, she makes
5797	a very good report o' the worm; but he that will
5798	believe all that they say, shall never be saved by
5799	half that they do: but this is most fallible, the
5800	worm's an odd worm.
5801	
5802	CLEOPATRA	Get thee hence; farewell.
5803	
5804	Clown	I wish you all joy of the worm.
5805	
5806	[Setting down his basket]
5807	
5808	CLEOPATRA	Farewell.
5809	
5810	Clown	You must think this, look you, that the worm will
5811	do his kind.
5812	
5813	CLEOPATRA	Ay, ay; farewell.
5814	
5815	Clown	Look you, the worm is not to be trusted but in the
5816	keeping of wise people; for, indeed, there is no
5817	goodness in worm.
5818	
5819	
5820	CLEOPATRA	Take thou no care; it shall be heeded.
5821	
5822	Clown	Very good. Give it nothing, I pray you, for it is
5823	not worth the feeding.
5824	
5825	CLEOPATRA	Will it eat me?
5826	
5827	Clown	You must not think I am so simple but I know the
5828	devil himself will not eat a woman: I know that a
5829	woman is a dish for the gods, if the devil dress her
5830	not. But, truly, these same whoreson devils do the
5831	gods great harm in their women; for in every ten
5832	that they make, the devils mar five.
5833	
5834	CLEOPATRA	Well, get thee gone; farewell.
5835	
5836	Clown	Yes, forsooth: I wish you joy o' the worm.
5837	
5838	[Exit]
5839	
5840	[Re-enter IRAS with a robe, crown, &c]
5841	
5842	CLEOPATRA	Give me my robe, put on my crown; I have
5843	Immortal longings in me: now no more
5844	The juice of Egypt's grape shall moist this lip:
5845	Yare, yare, good Iras; quick. Methinks I hear
5846	Antony call; I see him rouse himself
5847	To praise my noble act; I hear him mock
5848	The luck of Caesar, which the gods give men
5849	To excuse their after wrath: husband, I come:
5850	Now to that name my courage prove my title!
5851	I am fire and air; my other elements
5852	I give to baser life. So; have you done?
5853	Come then, and take the last warmth of my lips.
5854	Farewell, kind Charmian; Iras, long farewell.
5855	
5856	[Kisses them. IRAS falls and dies]
5857	
5858	Have I the aspic in my lips? Dost fall?
5859	If thou and nature can so gently part,
5860	The stroke of death is as a lover's pinch,
5861	Which hurts, and is desired. Dost thou lie still?
5862	If thus thou vanishest, thou tell'st the world
5863	It is not worth leave-taking.
5864	
5865	CHARMIAN	Dissolve, thick cloud, and rain; that I may say,
5866	The gods themselves do weep!
5867	
5868	CLEOPATRA	This proves me base:
5869	If she first meet the curled Antony,
5870	He'll make demand of her, and spend that kiss
5871	Which is my heaven to have. Come, thou
5872	mortal wretch,
5873	
5874	[To an asp, which she applies to her breast]
5875	
5876	With thy sharp teeth this knot intrinsicate
5877	Of life at once untie: poor venomous fool
5878	Be angry, and dispatch. O, couldst thou speak,
5879	That I might hear thee call great Caesar ass
5880	Unpolicied!
5881	
5882	CHARMIAN	          O eastern star!
5883	
5884	CLEOPATRA	Peace, peace!
5885	Dost thou not see my baby at my breast,
5886	That sucks the nurse asleep?
5887	
5888	CHARMIAN	O, break! O, break!
5889	
5890	CLEOPATRA	As sweet as balm, as soft as air, as gentle,--
5891	O Antony!--Nay, I will take thee too.
5892	
5893	[Applying another asp to her arm]
5894	
5895	What should I stay--
5896	
5897	[Dies]
5898	
5899	CHARMIAN	In this vile world? So, fare thee well.
5900	Now boast thee, death, in thy possession lies
5901	A lass unparallel'd. Downy windows, close;
5902	And golden Phoebus never be beheld
5903	Of eyes again so royal! Your crown's awry;
5904	I'll mend it, and then play.
5905	
5906	[Enter the Guard, rushing in]
5907	
5908	First Guard	Where is the queen?
5909	
5910	CHARMIAN	Speak softly, wake her not.
5911	
5912	First Guard	Caesar hath sent--
5913	
5914	CHARMIAN	                  Too slow a messenger.
5915	
5916	[Applies an asp]
5917	
5918	O, come apace, dispatch! I partly feel thee.
5919	
5920	First Guard	Approach, ho! All's not well: Caesar's beguiled.
5921	
5922	Second Guard	There's Dolabella sent from Caesar; call him.
5923	
5924	First Guard	What work is here! Charmian, is this well done?
5925	
5926	CHARMIAN	It is well done, and fitting for a princess
5927	Descended of so many royal kings.
5928	Ah, soldier!
5929	
5930	[Dies]
5931	
5932	[Re-enter DOLABELLA]
5933	
5934	DOLABELLA	How goes it here?
5935	
5936	Second Guard	                  All dead.
5937	
5938	DOLABELLA	Caesar, thy thoughts
5939	Touch their effects in this: thyself art coming
5940	To see perform'd the dreaded act which thou
5941	So sought'st to hinder.
5942	
5943	[Within  'A way there, a way for Caesar!']
5944	
5945	[Re-enter OCTAVIUS CAESAR and all his train marching]
5946	
5947	DOLABELLA	O sir, you are too sure an augurer;
5948	That you did fear is done.
5949	
5950	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Bravest at the last,
5951	She levell'd at our purposes, and, being royal,
5952	Took her own way. The manner of their deaths?
5953	I do not see them bleed.
5954	
5955	DOLABELLA	Who was last with them?
5956	
5957	First Guard	A simple countryman, that brought her figs:
5958	This was his basket.
5959	
5960	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Poison'd, then.
5961	
5962	First Guard	O Caesar,
5963	This Charmian lived but now; she stood and spake:
5964	I found her trimming up the diadem
5965	On her dead mistress; tremblingly she stood
5966	And on the sudden dropp'd.
5967	
5968	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	O noble weakness!
5969	If they had swallow'd poison, 'twould appear
5970	By external swelling: but she looks like sleep,
5971	As she would catch another Antony
5972	In her strong toil of grace.
5973	
5974	DOLABELLA	Here, on her breast,
5975	There is a vent of blood and something blown:
5976	The like is on her arm.
5977	
5978	First Guard	This is an aspic's trail: and these fig-leaves
5979	Have slime upon them, such as the aspic leaves
5980	Upon the caves of Nile.
5981	
5982	OCTAVIUS CAESAR	Most probable
5983	That so she died; for her physician tells me
5984	She hath pursued conclusions infinite
5985	Of easy ways to die. Take up her bed;
5986	And bear her women from the monument:
5987	She shall be buried by her Antony:
5988	No grave upon the earth shall clip in it
5989	A pair so famous. High events as these
5990	Strike those that make them; and their story is
5991	No less in pity than his glory which
5992	Brought them to be lamented. Our army shall
5993	In solemn show attend this funeral;
5994	And then to Rome. Come, Dolabella, see
5995	High order in this great solemnity.
5996	
5997	[Exeunt]

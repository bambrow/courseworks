61	
62	
63	[Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and other Lords;
64	Musicians attending]
65	
66	DUKE ORSINO	If music be the food of love, play on;
67	Give me excess of it, that, surfeiting,
68	The appetite may sicken, and so die.
69	That strain again! it had a dying fall:
70	O, it came o'er my ear like the sweet sound,
71	That breathes upon a bank of violets,
72	Stealing and giving odour! Enough; no more:
73	'Tis not so sweet now as it was before.
74	O spirit of love! how quick and fresh art thou,
75	That, notwithstanding thy capacity
76	Receiveth as the sea, nought enters there,
77	Of what validity and pitch soe'er,
78	But falls into abatement and low price,
79	Even in a minute: so full of shapes is fancy
80	That it alone is high fantastical.
81	
82	CURIO	Will you go hunt, my lord?
83	
84	DUKE ORSINO	What, Curio?
85	
86	CURIO	The hart.
87	
88	DUKE ORSINO	        Why, so I do, the noblest that I have:
89	O, when mine eyes did see Olivia first,
90	Methought she purged the air of pestilence!
91	That instant was I turn'd into a hart;
92	And my desires, like fell and cruel hounds,
93	E'er since pursue me.
94	
95	[Enter VALENTINE]
96	
97	How now! what news from her?
98	
99	VALENTINE	So please my lord, I might not be admitted;
100	But from her handmaid do return this answer:
101	The element itself, till seven years' heat,
102	Shall not behold her face at ample view;
103	But, like a cloistress, she will veiled walk
104	And water once a day her chamber round
105	With eye-offending brine: all this to season
106	A brother's dead love, which she would keep fresh
107	And lasting in her sad remembrance.
108	
109	DUKE ORSINO	O, she that hath a heart of that fine frame
110	To pay this debt of love but to a brother,
111	How will she love, when the rich golden shaft
112	Hath kill'd the flock of all affections else
113	That live in her; when liver, brain and heart,
114	These sovereign thrones, are all supplied, and fill'd
115	Her sweet perfections with one self king!
116	Away before me to sweet beds of flowers:
117	Love-thoughts lie rich when canopied with bowers.

132	
133	
134	[Enter VIOLA, a Captain, and Sailors]
135	
136	VIOLA	What country, friends, is this?
137	
138	Captain	This is Illyria, lady.
139	
140	VIOLA	And what should I do in Illyria?
141	My brother he is in Elysium.
142	Perchance he is not drown'd: what think you, sailors?
143	
144	Captain	It is perchance that you yourself were saved.
145	
146	VIOLA	O my poor brother! and so perchance may he be.
147	
148	Captain	True, madam: and, to comfort you with chance,
149	Assure yourself, after our ship did split,
150	When you and those poor number saved with you
151	Hung on our driving boat, I saw your brother,
152	Most provident in peril, bind himself,
153	Courage and hope both teaching him the practise,
154	To a strong mast that lived upon the sea;
155	Where, like Arion on the dolphin's back,
156	I saw him hold acquaintance with the waves
157	So long as I could see.
158	
159	VIOLA	For saying so, there's gold:
160	Mine own escape unfoldeth to my hope,
161	Whereto thy speech serves for authority,
162	The like of him. Know'st thou this country?
163	
164	Captain	Ay, madam, well; for I was bred and born
165	Not three hours' travel from this very place.
166	
167	VIOLA	Who governs here?
168	
169	Captain	A noble duke, in nature as in name.
170	
171	VIOLA	What is the name?
172	
173	Captain	Orsino.
174	
175	VIOLA	Orsino! I have heard my father name him:
176	He was a bachelor then.
177	
178	Captain	And so is now, or was so very late;
179	For but a month ago I went from hence,
180	And then 'twas fresh in murmur,--as, you know,
181	What great ones do the less will prattle of,--
182	That he did seek the love of fair Olivia.
183	
184	VIOLA	What's she?
185	
186	Captain	A virtuous maid, the daughter of a count
187	That died some twelvemonth since, then leaving her
188	In the protection of his son, her brother,
189	Who shortly also died: for whose dear love,
190	They say, she hath abjured the company
191	And sight of men.
192	
193	VIOLA	                  O that I served that lady
194	And might not be delivered to the world,
195	Till I had made mine own occasion mellow,
196	What my estate is!
197	
198	Captain	That were hard to compass;
199	Because she will admit no kind of suit,
200	No, not the duke's.
201	
202	VIOLA	There is a fair behavior in thee, captain;
203	And though that nature with a beauteous wall
204	Doth oft close in pollution, yet of thee
205	I will believe thou hast a mind that suits
206	With this thy fair and outward character.
207	I prithee, and I'll pay thee bounteously,
208	Conceal me what I am, and be my aid
209	For such disguise as haply shall become
210	The form of my intent. I'll serve this duke:
211	Thou shall present me as an eunuch to him:
212	It may be worth thy pains; for I can sing
213	And speak to him in many sorts of music
214	That will allow me very worth his service.
215	What else may hap to time I will commit;
216	Only shape thou thy silence to my wit.
217	
218	Captain	Be you his eunuch, and your mute I'll be:
219	When my tongue blabs, then let mine eyes not see.
220	
221	VIOLA	I thank thee: lead me on.

237	
238	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA]
239	
240	SIR TOBY BELCH	What a plague means my niece, to take the death of
241	her brother thus? I am sure care's an enemy to life.
242	
243	MARIA	By my troth, Sir Toby, you must come in earlier o'
244	nights: your cousin, my lady, takes great
245	exceptions to your ill hours.
246	
247	SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, let her except, before excepted.
248	
249	MARIA	Ay, but you must confine yourself within the modest
250	limits of order.
251	
252	SIR TOBY BELCH	Confine! I'll confine myself no finer than I am:
253	these clothes are good enough to drink in; and so be
254	these boots too: an they be not, let them hang
255	themselves in their own straps.
256	
257	MARIA	That quaffing and drinking will undo you: I heard
258	my lady talk of it yesterday; and of a foolish
259	knight that you brought in one night here to be her wooer.
260	
261	SIR TOBY BELCH	Who, Sir Andrew Aguecheek?
262	
263	MARIA	Ay, he.
264	
265	SIR TOBY BELCH	He's as tall a man as any's in Illyria.
266	
267	MARIA	What's that to the purpose?
268	
269	SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, he has three thousand ducats a year.
270	
271	MARIA	Ay, but he'll have but a year in all these ducats:
272	he's a very fool and a prodigal.
273	
274	SIR TOBY BELCH	Fie, that you'll say so! he plays o' the
275	viol-de-gamboys, and speaks three or four languages
276	word for word without book, and hath all the good
277	gifts of nature.
278	
279	MARIA	He hath indeed, almost natural: for besides that
280	he's a fool, he's a great quarreller: and but that
281	he hath the gift of a coward to allay the gust he
282	hath in quarrelling, 'tis thought among the prudent
283	he would quickly have the gift of a grave.
284	
285	SIR TOBY BELCH	By this hand, they are scoundrels and subtractors
286	that say so of him. Who are they?
287	
288	MARIA	They that add, moreover, he's drunk nightly in your company.
289	
290	SIR TOBY BELCH	With drinking healths to my niece: I'll drink to
291	her as long as there is a passage in my throat and
292	drink in Illyria: he's a coward and a coystrill
293	that will not drink to my niece till his brains turn
294	o' the toe like a parish-top. What, wench!
295	Castiliano vulgo! for here comes Sir Andrew Agueface.
296	
297	[Enter SIR ANDREW]
298	
299	SIR ANDREW	Sir Toby Belch! how now, Sir Toby Belch!
300	
301	SIR TOBY BELCH	Sweet Sir Andrew!
302	
303	SIR ANDREW	Bless you, fair shrew.
304	
305	MARIA	And you too, sir.
306	
307	SIR TOBY BELCH	Accost, Sir Andrew, accost.
308	
309	SIR ANDREW	What's that?
310	
311	SIR TOBY BELCH	My niece's chambermaid.
312	
313	SIR ANDREW	Good Mistress Accost, I desire better acquaintance.
314	
315	MARIA	My name is Mary, sir.
316	
317	SIR ANDREW	Good Mistress Mary Accost,--
318	
319	SIR TOBY BELCH	You mistake, knight; 'accost' is front her, board
320	her, woo her, assail her.
321	
322	SIR ANDREW	By my troth, I would not undertake her in this
323	company. Is that the meaning of 'accost'?
324	
325	MARIA	Fare you well, gentlemen.
326	
327	SIR TOBY BELCH	An thou let part so, Sir Andrew, would thou mightst
328	never draw sword again.
329	
330	SIR ANDREW	An you part so, mistress, I would I might never
331	draw sword again. Fair lady, do you think you have
332	fools in hand?
333	
334	MARIA	Sir, I have not you by the hand.
335	
336	SIR ANDREW	Marry, but you shall have; and here's my hand.
337	
338	MARIA	Now, sir, 'thought is free:' I pray you, bring
339	your hand to the buttery-bar and let it drink.
340	
341	SIR ANDREW	Wherefore, sweet-heart? what's your metaphor?
342	
343	MARIA	It's dry, sir.
344	
345	SIR ANDREW	Why, I think so: I am not such an ass but I can
346	keep my hand dry. But what's your jest?
347	
348	MARIA	A dry jest, sir.
349	
350	SIR ANDREW	Are you full of them?
351	
352	MARIA	Ay, sir, I have them at my fingers' ends: marry,
353	now I let go your hand, I am barren.
354	
355	[Exit]
356	
357	SIR TOBY BELCH	O knight thou lackest a cup of canary: when did I
358	see thee so put down?
359	
360	SIR ANDREW	Never in your life, I think; unless you see canary
361	put me down. Methinks sometimes I have no more wit
362	than a Christian or an ordinary man has: but I am a
363	great eater of beef and I believe that does harm to my wit.
364	
365	SIR TOBY BELCH	No question.
366	
367	SIR ANDREW	An I thought that, I'ld forswear it. I'll ride home
368	to-morrow, Sir Toby.
369	
370	SIR TOBY BELCH	Pourquoi, my dear knight?
371	
372	SIR ANDREW	What is 'Pourquoi'? do or not do? I would I had
373	bestowed that time in the tongues that I have in
374	fencing, dancing and bear-baiting: O, had I but
375	followed the arts!
376	
377	SIR TOBY BELCH	Then hadst thou had an excellent head of hair.
378	
379	SIR ANDREW	Why, would that have mended my hair?
380	
381	SIR TOBY BELCH	Past question; for thou seest it will not curl by nature.
382	
383	SIR ANDREW	But it becomes me well enough, does't not?
384	
385	SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent; it hangs like flax on a distaff; and I
386	hope to see a housewife take thee between her legs
387	and spin it off.
388	
389	SIR ANDREW	Faith, I'll home to-morrow, Sir Toby: your niece
390	will not be seen; or if she be, it's four to one
391	she'll none of me: the count himself here hard by woos her.
392	
393	SIR TOBY BELCH	She'll none o' the count: she'll not match above
394	her degree, neither in estate, years, nor wit; I
395	have heard her swear't. Tut, there's life in't,
396	man.
397	
398	SIR ANDREW	I'll stay a month longer. I am a fellow o' the
399	strangest mind i' the world; I delight in masques
400	and revels sometimes altogether.
401	
402	SIR TOBY BELCH	Art thou good at these kickshawses, knight?
403	
404	SIR ANDREW	As any man in Illyria, whatsoever he be, under the
405	degree of my betters; and yet I will not compare
406	with an old man.
407	
408	SIR TOBY BELCH	What is thy excellence in a galliard, knight?
409	
410	SIR ANDREW	Faith, I can cut a caper.
411	
412	SIR TOBY BELCH	And I can cut the mutton to't.
413	
414	SIR ANDREW	And I think I have the back-trick simply as strong
415	as any man in Illyria.
416	
417	SIR TOBY BELCH	Wherefore are these things hid? wherefore have
418	these gifts a curtain before 'em? are they like to
419	take dust, like Mistress Mall's picture? why dost
420	thou not go to church in a galliard and come home in
421	a coranto? My very walk should be a jig; I would not
422	so much as make water but in a sink-a-pace. What
423	dost thou mean? Is it a world to hide virtues in?
424	I did think, by the excellent constitution of thy
425	leg, it was formed under the star of a galliard.
426	
427	SIR ANDREW	Ay, 'tis strong, and it does indifferent well in a
428	flame-coloured stock. Shall we set about some revels?
429	
430	SIR TOBY BELCH	What shall we do else? were we not born under Taurus?
431	
432	SIR ANDREW	Taurus! That's sides and heart.
433	
434	SIR TOBY BELCH	No, sir; it is legs and thighs. Let me see the
435	caper; ha! higher: ha, ha! excellent!

451	
452	[Enter VALENTINE and VIOLA in man's attire]
453	
454	VALENTINE	If the duke continue these favours towards you,
455	Cesario, you are like to be much advanced: he hath
456	known you but three days, and already you are no stranger.
457	
458	VIOLA	You either fear his humour or my negligence, that
459	you call in question the continuance of his love:
460	is he inconstant, sir, in his favours?
461	
462	VALENTINE	No, believe me.
463	
464	VIOLA	I thank you. Here comes the count.
465	
466	[Enter DUKE ORSINO, CURIO, and Attendants]
467	
468	DUKE ORSINO	Who saw Cesario, ho?
469	
470	VIOLA	On your attendance, my lord; here.
471	
472	DUKE ORSINO	Stand you a while aloof, Cesario,
473	Thou know'st no less but all; I have unclasp'd
474	To thee the book even of my secret soul:
475	Therefore, good youth, address thy gait unto her;
476	Be not denied access, stand at her doors,
477	And tell them, there thy fixed foot shall grow
478	Till thou have audience.
479	
480	VIOLA	Sure, my noble lord,
481	If she be so abandon'd to her sorrow
482	As it is spoke, she never will admit me.
483	
484	DUKE ORSINO	Be clamorous and leap all civil bounds
485	Rather than make unprofited return.
486	
487	VIOLA	Say I do speak with her, my lord, what then?
488	
489	DUKE ORSINO	O, then unfold the passion of my love,
490	Surprise her with discourse of my dear faith:
491	It shall become thee well to act my woes;
492	She will attend it better in thy youth
493	Than in a nuncio's of more grave aspect.
494	
495	VIOLA	I think not so, my lord.
496	
497	DUKE ORSINO	Dear lad, believe it;
498	For they shall yet belie thy happy years,
499	That say thou art a man: Diana's lip
500	Is not more smooth and rubious; thy small pipe
501	Is as the maiden's organ, shrill and sound,
502	And all is semblative a woman's part.
503	I know thy constellation is right apt
504	For this affair. Some four or five attend him;
505	All, if you will; for I myself am best
506	When least in company. Prosper well in this,
507	And thou shalt live as freely as thy lord,
508	To call his fortunes thine.
509	
510	VIOLA	I'll do my best
511	To woo your lady:
512	
513	[Aside]
514	
515	yet, a barful strife!
516	Whoe'er I woo, myself would be his wife.

532	
533	[Enter MARIA and Clown]
534	
535	MARIA	Nay, either tell me where thou hast been, or I will
536	not open my lips so wide as a bristle may enter in
537	way of thy excuse: my lady will hang thee for thy absence.
538	
539	Clown	Let her hang me: he that is well hanged in this
540	world needs to fear no colours.
541	
542	MARIA	Make that good.
543	
544	Clown	He shall see none to fear.
545	
546	MARIA	A good lenten answer: I can tell thee where that
547	saying was born, of 'I fear no colours.'
548	
549	Clown	Where, good Mistress Mary?
550	
551	MARIA	In the wars; and that may you be bold to say in your foolery.
552	
553	Clown	Well, God give them wisdom that have it; and those
554	that are fools, let them use their talents.
555	
556	MARIA	Yet you will be hanged for being so long absent; or,
557	to be turned away, is not that as good as a hanging to you?
558	
559	Clown	Many a good hanging prevents a bad marriage; and,
560	for turning away, let summer bear it out.
561	
562	MARIA	You are resolute, then?
563	
564	Clown	Not so, neither; but I am resolved on two points.
565	
566	MARIA	That if one break, the other will hold; or, if both
567	break, your gaskins fall.
568	
569	Clown	Apt, in good faith; very apt. Well, go thy way; if
570	Sir Toby would leave drinking, thou wert as witty a
571	piece of Eve's flesh as any in Illyria.
572	
573	MARIA	Peace, you rogue, no more o' that. Here comes my
574	lady: make your excuse wisely, you were best.
575	
576	[Exit]
577	
578	Clown	Wit, an't be thy will, put me into good fooling!
579	Those wits, that think they have thee, do very oft
580	prove fools; and I, that am sure I lack thee, may
581	pass for a wise man: for what says Quinapalus?
582	'Better a witty fool, than a foolish wit.'
583	
584	[Enter OLIVIA with MALVOLIO]
585	
586	God bless thee, lady!

590	Clown	Do you not hear, fellows? Take away the lady.
591	
592	OLIVIA	Go to, you're a dry fool; I'll no more of you:
593	besides, you grow dishonest.
594	
595	Clown	Two faults, madonna, that drink and good counsel
596	will amend: for give the dry fool drink, then is
597	the fool not dry: bid the dishonest man mend
598	himself; if he mend, he is no longer dishonest; if
599	he cannot, let the botcher mend him. Any thing
600	that's mended is but patched: virtue that
601	transgresses is but patched with sin; and sin that
602	amends is but patched with virtue. If that this
603	simple syllogism will serve, so; if it will not,
604	what remedy? As there is no true cuckold but
605	calamity, so beauty's a flower. The lady bade take
606	away the fool; therefore, I say again, take her away.
607	
608	OLIVIA	Sir, I bade them take away you.
609	
610	Clown	Misprision in the highest degree! Lady, cucullus non
611	facit monachum; that's as much to say as I wear not
612	motley in my brain. Good madonna, give me leave to
613	prove you a fool.
614	
615	OLIVIA	Can you do it?
616	
617	Clown	Dexterously, good madonna.
618	
619	OLIVIA	Make your proof.
620	
621	Clown	I must catechise you for it, madonna: good my mouse
622	of virtue, answer me.
623	
624	OLIVIA	Well, sir, for want of other idleness, I'll bide your proof.
625	
626	Clown	Good madonna, why mournest thou?
627	
628	OLIVIA	Good fool, for my brother's death.
629	
630	Clown	I think his soul is in hell, madonna.
631	
632	OLIVIA	I know his soul is in heaven, fool.
633	
634	Clown	The more fool, madonna, to mourn for your brother's
635	soul being in heaven. Take away the fool, gentlemen.
636	
637	OLIVIA	What think you of this fool, Malvolio? doth he not mend?
638	
639	MALVOLIO	Yes, and shall do till the pangs of death shake him:
640	infirmity, that decays the wise, doth ever make the
641	better fool.
642	
643	Clown	God send you, sir, a speedy infirmity, for the
644	better increasing your folly! Sir Toby will be
645	sworn that I am no fox; but he will not pass his
646	word for two pence that you are no fool.
647	
648	OLIVIA	How say you to that, Malvolio?
649	
650	MALVOLIO	I marvel your ladyship takes delight in such a
651	barren rascal: I saw him put down the other day
652	with an ordinary fool that has no more brain
653	than a stone. Look you now, he's out of his guard
654	already; unless you laugh and minister occasion to
655	him, he is gagged. I protest, I take these wise men,
656	that crow so at these set kind of fools, no better
657	than the fools' zanies.
658	
659	OLIVIA	Oh, you are sick of self-love, Malvolio, and taste
660	with a distempered appetite. To be generous,
661	guiltless and of free disposition, is to take those
662	things for bird-bolts that you deem cannon-bullets:
663	there is no slander in an allowed fool, though he do
664	nothing but rail; nor no railing in a known discreet
665	man, though he do nothing but reprove.
666	
667	Clown	Now Mercury endue thee with leasing, for thou
668	speakest well of fools!
669	
670	[Re-enter MARIA]
671	
672	MARIA	Madam, there is at the gate a young gentleman much
673	desires to speak with you.
674	
675	OLIVIA	From the Count Orsino, is it?
676	
677	MARIA	I know not, madam: 'tis a fair young man, and well attended.
678	
679	OLIVIA	Who of my people hold him in delay?
680	
681	MARIA	Sir Toby, madam, your kinsman.
682	
683	OLIVIA	Fetch him off, I pray you; he speaks nothing but
684	madman: fie on him!
685	
686	[Exit MARIA]
687	
688	Go you, Malvolio: if it be a suit from the count, I
689	am sick, or not at home; what you will, to dismiss it.
690	
691	[Exit MALVOLIO]
692	
693	Now you see, sir, how your fooling grows old, and
694	people dislike it.
695	
696	Clown	Thou hast spoke for us, madonna, as if thy eldest
697	son should be a fool; whose skull Jove cram with
698	brains! for,--here he comes,--one of thy kin has a
699	most weak pia mater.
700	
701	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH]
702	
703	OLIVIA	By mine honour, half drunk. What is he at the gate, cousin?
704	
705	SIR TOBY BELCH	A gentleman.
706	
707	OLIVIA	A gentleman! what gentleman?
708	
709	SIR TOBY BELCH	'Tis a gentle man here--a plague o' these
710	pickle-herring! How now, sot!
711	
712	Clown	Good Sir Toby!
713	
714	OLIVIA	Cousin, cousin, how have you come so early by this lethargy?
715	
716	SIR TOBY BELCH	Lechery! I defy lechery. There's one at the gate.
717	
718	OLIVIA	Ay, marry, what is he?
719	
720	SIR TOBY BELCH	Let him be the devil, an he will, I care not: give
721	me faith, say I. Well, it's all one.
722	
723	[Exit]
724	
725	OLIVIA	What's a drunken man like, fool?
726	
727	Clown	Like a drowned man, a fool and a mad man: one
728	draught above heat makes him a fool; the second mads
729	him; and a third drowns him.
730	
731	OLIVIA	Go thou and seek the crowner, and let him sit o' my
732	coz; for he's in the third degree of drink, he's
733	drowned: go, look after him.
734	
735	Clown	He is but mad yet, madonna; and the fool shall look
736	to the madman.
737	
738	[Exit]
739	
740	[Re-enter MALVOLIO]
741	
742	MALVOLIO	Madam, yond young fellow swears he will speak with
743	you. I told him you were sick; he takes on him to
744	understand so much, and therefore comes to speak
745	with you. I told him you were asleep; he seems to
746	have a foreknowledge of that too, and therefore
747	comes to speak with you. What is to be said to him,
748	lady? he's fortified against any denial.
749	
750	OLIVIA	Tell him he shall not speak with me.
751	
752	MALVOLIO	Has been told so; and he says, he'll stand at your
753	door like a sheriff's post, and be the supporter to
754	a bench, but he'll speak with you.
755	
756	OLIVIA	What kind o' man is he?
757	
758	MALVOLIO	Why, of mankind.
759	
760	OLIVIA	What manner of man?
761	
762	MALVOLIO	Of very ill manner; he'll speak with you, will you or no.
763	
764	OLIVIA	Of what personage and years is he?
765	
766	MALVOLIO	Not yet old enough for a man, nor young enough for
767	a boy; as a squash is before 'tis a peascod, or a
768	cooling when 'tis almost an apple: 'tis with him
769	in standing water, between boy and man. He is very
770	well-favoured and he speaks very shrewishly; one
771	would think his mother's milk were scarce out of him.
772	
773	OLIVIA	Let him approach: call in my gentlewoman.
774	
775	MALVOLIO	Gentlewoman, my lady calls.
776	
777	[Exit]
778	
779	[Re-enter MARIA]
780	
781	OLIVIA	Give me my veil: come, throw it o'er my face.
782	We'll once more hear Orsino's embassy.
783	
784	[Enter VIOLA, and Attendants]
785	
786	VIOLA	The honourable lady of the house, which is she?
787	
788	OLIVIA	Speak to me; I shall answer for her.
789	Your will?
790	
791	VIOLA	Most radiant, exquisite and unmatchable beauty,--I
792	pray you, tell me if this be the lady of the house,
793	for I never saw her: I would be loath to cast away
794	my speech, for besides that it is excellently well
795	penned, I have taken great pains to con it. Good
796	beauties, let me sustain no scorn; I am very
797	comptible, even to the least sinister usage.
798	
799	OLIVIA	Whence came you, sir?
800	
801	VIOLA	I can say little more than I have studied, and that
802	question's out of my part. Good gentle one, give me
803	modest assurance if you be the lady of the house,
804	that I may proceed in my speech.
805	
806	OLIVIA	Are you a comedian?
807	
808	VIOLA	No, my profound heart: and yet, by the very fangs
809	of malice I swear, I am not that I play. Are you
810	the lady of the house?
811	
812	OLIVIA	If I do not usurp myself, I am.
813	
814	VIOLA	Most certain, if you are she, you do usurp
815	yourself; for what is yours to bestow is not yours
816	to reserve. But this is from my commission: I will
817	on with my speech in your praise, and then show you
818	the heart of my message.
819	
820	OLIVIA	Come to what is important in't: I forgive you the praise.
821	
822	VIOLA	Alas, I took great pains to study it, and 'tis poetical.
823	
824	OLIVIA	It is the more like to be feigned: I pray you,
825	keep it in. I heard you were saucy at my gates,
826	and allowed your approach rather to wonder at you
827	than to hear you. If you be not mad, be gone; if
828	you have reason, be brief: 'tis not that time of
829	moon with me to make one in so skipping a dialogue.
830	
831	MARIA	Will you hoist sail, sir? here lies your way.
832	
833	VIOLA	No, good swabber; I am to hull here a little
834	longer. Some mollification for your giant, sweet
835	lady. Tell me your mind: I am a messenger.
836	
837	OLIVIA	Sure, you have some hideous matter to deliver, when
838	the courtesy of it is so fearful. Speak your office.
839	
840	VIOLA	It alone concerns your ear. I bring no overture of
841	war, no taxation of homage: I hold the olive in my
842	hand; my words are as fun of peace as matter.
843	
844	OLIVIA	Yet you began rudely. What are you? what would you?
845	
846	VIOLA	The rudeness that hath appeared in me have I
847	learned from my entertainment. What I am, and what I
848	would, are as secret as maidenhead; to your ears,
849	divinity, to any other's, profanation.
850	
851	OLIVIA	Give us the place alone: we will hear this divinity.
852	
853	[Exeunt MARIA and Attendants]
854	
855	Now, sir, what is your text?
856	
857	VIOLA	Most sweet lady,--
858	
859	OLIVIA	A comfortable doctrine, and much may be said of it.
860	Where lies your text?
861	
862	VIOLA	In Orsino's bosom.
863	
864	OLIVIA	In his bosom! In what chapter of his bosom?
865	
866	VIOLA	To answer by the method, in the first of his heart.
867	
868	OLIVIA	O, I have read it: it is heresy. Have you no more to say?
869	
870	VIOLA	Good madam, let me see your face.
871	
872	OLIVIA	Have you any commission from your lord to negotiate
873	with my face? You are now out of your text: but
874	we will draw the curtain and show you the picture.
875	Look you, sir, such a one I was this present: is't
876	not well done?
877	
878	[Unveiling]
879	
880	VIOLA	Excellently done, if God did all.
881	
882	OLIVIA	'Tis in grain, sir; 'twill endure wind and weather.
883	
884	VIOLA	'Tis beauty truly blent, whose red and white
885	Nature's own sweet and cunning hand laid on:
886	Lady, you are the cruell'st she alive,
887	If you will lead these graces to the grave
888	And leave the world no copy.
889	
890	OLIVIA	O, sir, I will not be so hard-hearted; I will give
891	out divers schedules of my beauty: it shall be
892	inventoried, and every particle and utensil
893	labelled to my will: as, item, two lips,
894	indifferent red; item, two grey eyes, with lids to
895	them; item, one neck, one chin, and so forth. Were
896	you sent hither to praise me?
897	
898	VIOLA	I see you what you are, you are too proud;
899	But, if you were the devil, you are fair.
900	My lord and master loves you: O, such love
901	Could be but recompensed, though you were crown'd
902	The nonpareil of beauty!
903	
904	OLIVIA	How does he love me?
905	
906	VIOLA	With adorations, fertile tears,
907	With groans that thunder love, with sighs of fire.
908	
909	OLIVIA	Your lord does know my mind; I cannot love him:
910	Yet I suppose him virtuous, know him noble,
911	Of great estate, of fresh and stainless youth;
912	In voices well divulged, free, learn'd and valiant;
913	And in dimension and the shape of nature
914	A gracious person: but yet I cannot love him;
915	He might have took his answer long ago.
916	
917	VIOLA	If I did love you in my master's flame,
918	With such a suffering, such a deadly life,
919	In your denial I would find no sense;
920	I would not understand it.
921	
922	OLIVIA	Why, what would you?
923	
924	VIOLA	Make me a willow cabin at your gate,
925	And call upon my soul within the house;
926	Write loyal cantons of contemned love
927	And sing them loud even in the dead of night;
928	Halloo your name to the reverberate hills
929	And make the babbling gossip of the air
930	Cry out 'Olivia!' O, You should not rest
931	Between the elements of air and earth,
932	But you should pity me!
933	
934	OLIVIA	You might do much.
935	What is your parentage?
936	
937	VIOLA	Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
938	I am a gentleman.
939	
940	OLIVIA	                  Get you to your lord;
941	I cannot love him: let him send no more;
942	Unless, perchance, you come to me again,
943	To tell me how he takes it. Fare you well:
944	I thank you for your pains: spend this for me.
945	
946	VIOLA	I am no fee'd post, lady; keep your purse:
947	My master, not myself, lacks recompense.
948	Love make his heart of flint that you shall love;
949	And let your fervor, like my master's, be
950	Placed in contempt! Farewell, fair cruelty.
951	
952	[Exit]
953	
954	OLIVIA	'What is your parentage?'
955	'Above my fortunes, yet my state is well:
956	I am a gentleman.' I'll be sworn thou art;
957	Thy tongue, thy face, thy limbs, actions and spirit,
958	Do give thee five-fold blazon: not too fast:
959	soft, soft!
960	Unless the master were the man. How now!
961	Even so quickly may one catch the plague?
962	Methinks I feel this youth's perfections
963	With an invisible and subtle stealth
964	To creep in at mine eyes. Well, let it be.
965	What ho, Malvolio!
966	
967	[Re-enter MALVOLIO]
968	
969	MALVOLIO	                  Here, madam, at your service.
970	
971	OLIVIA	Run after that same peevish messenger,
972	The county's man: he left this ring behind him,
973	Would I or not: tell him I'll none of it.
974	Desire him not to flatter with his lord,
975	Nor hold him up with hopes; I am not for him:
976	If that the youth will come this way to-morrow,
977	I'll give him reasons for't: hie thee, Malvolio.
978	
979	MALVOLIO	Madam, I will.
980	
981	[Exit]
982	
983	OLIVIA	I do I know not what, and fear to find
984	Mine eye too great a flatterer for my mind.
985	Fate, show thy force: ourselves we do not owe;
986	What is decreed must be, and be this so.

1000	SCENE I	The sea-coast.
1001	
1002	
1003	[Enter ANTONIO and SEBASTIAN]
1004	
1005	ANTONIO	Will you stay no longer? nor will you not that I go with you?
1006	
1007	SEBASTIAN	By your patience, no. My stars shine darkly over
1008	me: the malignancy of my fate might perhaps
1009	distemper yours; therefore I shall crave of you your
1010	leave that I may bear my evils alone: it were a bad
1011	recompense for your love, to lay any of them on you.
1012	
1013	ANTONIO: Let me yet know of you whither you are bound.
1014	
1015	SEBASTIAN	No, sooth, sir: my determinate voyage is mere
1016	extravagancy. But I perceive in you so excellent a
1017	touch of modesty, that you will not extort from me
1018	what I am willing to keep in; therefore it charges
1019	me in manners the rather to express myself. You
1020	must know of me then, Antonio, my name is Sebastian,
1021	which I called Roderigo. My father was that
1022	Sebastian of Messaline, whom I know you have heard
1023	of. He left behind him myself and a sister, both
1024	born in an hour: if the heavens had been pleased,
1025	would we had so ended! but you, sir, altered that;
1026	for some hour before you took me from the breach of
1027	the sea was my sister drowned.
1028	
1029	ANTONIO	Alas the day!
1030	
1031	SEBASTIAN	A lady, sir, though it was said she much resembled
1032	me, was yet of many accounted beautiful: but,
1033	though I could not with such estimable wonder
1034	overfar believe that, yet thus far I will boldly
1035	publish her; she bore a mind that envy could not but
1036	call fair. She is drowned already, sir, with salt
1037	water, though I seem to drown her remembrance again with more.
1038	
1039	ANTONIO	Pardon me, sir, your bad entertainment.
1040	
1041	SEBASTIAN	O good Antonio, forgive me your trouble.
1042	
1043	ANTONIO	If you will not murder me for my love, let me be
1044	your servant.
1045	
1046	SEBASTIAN	If you will not undo what you have done, that is,
1047	kill him whom you have recovered, desire it not.
1048	Fare ye well at once: my bosom is full of kindness,
1049	and I am yet so near the manners of my mother, that
1050	upon the least occasion more mine eyes will tell
1051	tales of me. I am bound to the Count Orsino's court: farewell.
1052	
1053	[Exit]
1054	
1055	ANTONIO	The gentleness of all the gods go with thee!
1056	I have many enemies in Orsino's court,
1057	Else would I very shortly see thee there.
1058	But, come what may, I do adore thee so,
1059	That danger shall seem sport, and I will go.
1060

1074	
1075	
1076	[Enter VIOLA, MALVOLIO following]
1077	
1078	MALVOLIO	Were not you even now with the Countess Olivia?
1079	
1080	VIOLA	Even now, sir; on a moderate pace I have since
1081	arrived but hither.
1082	
1083	MALVOLIO	She returns this ring to you, sir: you might have
1084	saved me my pains, to have taken it away yourself.
1085	She adds, moreover, that you should put your lord
1086	into a desperate assurance she will none of him:
1087	and one thing more, that you be never so hardy to
1088	come again in his affairs, unless it be to report
1089	your lord's taking of this. Receive it so.
1090	
1091	VIOLA	She took the ring of me: I'll none of it.
1092	
1093	MALVOLIO	Come, sir, you peevishly threw it to her; and her
1094	will is, it should be so returned: if it be worth
1095	stooping for, there it lies in your eye; if not, be
1096	it his that finds it.
1097	
1098	[Exit]
1099	
1100	VIOLA	I left no ring with her: what means this lady?
1101	Fortune forbid my outside have not charm'd her!
1102	She made good view of me; indeed, so much,
1103	That sure methought her eyes had lost her tongue,
1104	For she did speak in starts distractedly.
1105	She loves me, sure; the cunning of her passion
1106	Invites me in this churlish messenger.
1107	None of my lord's ring! why, he sent her none.
1108	I am the man: if it be so, as 'tis,
1109	Poor lady, she were better love a dream.
1110	Disguise, I see, thou art a wickedness,
1111	Wherein the pregnant enemy does much.
1112	How easy is it for the proper-false
1113	In women's waxen hearts to set their forms!
1114	Alas, our frailty is the cause, not we!
1115	For such as we are made of, such we be.
1116	How will this fadge? my master loves her dearly;
1117	And I, poor monster, fond as much on him;
1118	And she, mistaken, seems to dote on me.
1119	What will become of this? As I am man,
1120	My state is desperate for my master's love;
1121	As I am woman,--now alas the day!--
1122	What thriftless sighs shall poor Olivia breathe!
1123	O time! thou must untangle this, not I;
1124	It is too hard a knot for me to untie!

1138	SCENE III	OLIVIA's house.
1139	
1140	
1141	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and SIR ANDREW]
1142	
1143	SIR TOBY BELCH	Approach, Sir Andrew: not to be abed after
1144	midnight is to be up betimes; and 'diluculo
1145	surgere,' thou know'st,--
1146	
1147	SIR ANDREW	Nay, my troth, I know not: but I know, to be up
1148	late is to be up late.
1149	
1150	SIR TOBY BELCH	A false conclusion: I hate it as an unfilled can.
1151	To be up after midnight and to go to bed then, is
1152	early: so that to go to bed after midnight is to go
1153	to bed betimes. Does not our life consist of the
1154	four elements?
1155	
1156	SIR ANDREW	Faith, so they say; but I think it rather consists
1157	of eating and drinking.
1158	
1159	SIR TOBY BELCH	Thou'rt a scholar; let us therefore eat and drink.
1160	Marian, I say! a stoup of wine!
1161	
1162	[Enter Clown]
1163	
1164	SIR ANDREW	Here comes the fool, i' faith.
1165	
1166	Clown	How now, my hearts! did you never see the picture
1167	of 'we three'?
1168	
1169	SIR TOBY BELCH	Welcome, ass. Now let's have a catch.
1170	
1171	SIR ANDREW	By my troth, the fool has an excellent breast. I
1172	had rather than forty shillings I had such a leg,
1173	and so sweet a breath to sing, as the fool has. In
1174	sooth, thou wast in very gracious fooling last
1175	night, when thou spokest of Pigrogromitus, of the
1176	Vapians passing the equinoctial of Queubus: 'twas
1177	very good, i' faith. I sent thee sixpence for thy
1178	leman: hadst it?
1179	
1180	Clown	I did impeticos thy gratillity; for Malvolio's nose
1181	is no whipstock: my lady has a white hand, and the
1182	Myrmidons are no bottle-ale houses.
1183	
1184	SIR ANDREW	Excellent! why, this is the best fooling, when all
1185	is done. Now, a song.
1186	
1187	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come on; there is sixpence for you: let's have a song.
1188	
1189	SIR ANDREW	There's a testril of me too: if one knight give a--
1190	
1191	Clown	Would you have a love-song, or a song of good life?
1192	
1193	SIR TOBY BELCH	A love-song, a love-song.
1194	
1195	SIR ANDREW	Ay, ay: I care not for good life.
1196	
1197	Clown	[Sings]
1198	
1199	O mistress mine, where are you roaming?
1200	O, stay and hear; your true love's coming,
1201	That can sing both high and low:
1202	Trip no further, pretty sweeting;
1203	Journeys end in lovers meeting,
1204	Every wise man's son doth know.
1205	
1206	SIR ANDREW	Excellent good, i' faith.
1207	
1208	SIR TOBY BELCH	Good, good.
1209	
1210	Clown	[Sings]
1211	
1212	What is love? 'tis not hereafter;
1213	Present mirth hath present laughter;
1214	What's to come is still unsure:
1215	In delay there lies no plenty;
1216	Then come kiss me, sweet and twenty,
1217	Youth's a stuff will not endure.
1218	
1219	SIR ANDREW	A mellifluous voice, as I am true knight.
1220	
1221	SIR TOBY BELCH	A contagious breath.
1222	
1223	SIR ANDREW	Very sweet and contagious, i' faith.
1224	
1225	SIR TOBY BELCH	To hear by the nose, it is dulcet in contagion.
1226	But shall we make the welkin dance indeed? shall we
1227	rouse the night-owl in a catch that will draw three
1228	souls out of one weaver? shall we do that?
1229	
1230	SIR ANDREW	An you love me, let's do't: I am dog at a catch.
1231	
1232	Clown	By'r lady, sir, and some dogs will catch well.
1233	
1234	SIR ANDREW	Most certain. Let our catch be, 'Thou knave.'
1235	
1236	Clown	'Hold thy peace, thou knave,' knight? I shall be
1237	constrained in't to call thee knave, knight.
1238	
1239	SIR ANDREW	'Tis not the first time I have constrained one to
1240	call me knave. Begin, fool: it begins 'Hold thy peace.'
1241	
1242	Clown	I shall never begin if I hold my peace.
1243	
1244	SIR ANDREW	Good, i' faith. Come, begin.
1245	
1246	[Catch sung]
1247	
1248	[Enter MARIA]
1249	
1250	MARIA	What a caterwauling do you keep here! If my lady
1251	have not called up her steward Malvolio and bid him
1252	turn you out of doors, never trust me.
1253	
1254	SIR TOBY BELCH	My lady's a Cataian, we are politicians, Malvolio's
1255	a Peg-a-Ramsey, and 'Three merry men be we.' Am not
1256	I consanguineous? am I not of her blood?
1257	Tillyvally. Lady!
1258	
1259	[Sings]
1260	
1261	'There dwelt a man in Babylon, lady, lady!'
1262	
1263	Clown	Beshrew me, the knight's in admirable fooling.
1264	
1265	SIR ANDREW	Ay, he does well enough if he be disposed, and so do
1266	I too: he does it with a better grace, but I do it
1267	more natural.
1268	
1269	SIR TOBY BELCH	[Sings]  'O, the twelfth day of December,'--
1270	
1271	MARIA	For the love o' God, peace!
1272	
1273	[Enter MALVOLIO]
1274	
1275	MALVOLIO	My masters, are you mad? or what are you? Have ye
1276	no wit, manners, nor honesty, but to gabble like
1277	tinkers at this time of night? Do ye make an
1278	alehouse of my lady's house, that ye squeak out your
1279	coziers' catches without any mitigation or remorse
1280	of voice? Is there no respect of place, persons, nor
1281	time in you?
1282	
1283	SIR TOBY BELCH	We did keep time, sir, in our catches. Sneck up!
1284	
1285	MALVOLIO	Sir Toby, I must be round with you. My lady bade me
1286	tell you, that, though she harbours you as her
1287	kinsman, she's nothing allied to your disorders. If
1288	you can separate yourself and your misdemeanors, you
1289	are welcome to the house; if not, an it would please
1290	you to take leave of her, she is very willing to bid
1291	you farewell.
1292	
1293	SIR TOBY BELCH	'Farewell, dear heart, since I must needs be gone.'
1294	
1295	MARIA	Nay, good Sir Toby.
1296	
1297	Clown	'His eyes do show his days are almost done.'
1298	
1299	MALVOLIO	Is't even so?
1300	
1301	SIR TOBY BELCH	'But I will never die.'
1302	
1303	Clown	Sir Toby, there you lie.
1304	
1305	MALVOLIO	This is much credit to you.
1306	
1307	SIR TOBY BELCH	'Shall I bid him go?'
1308	
1309	Clown	'What an if you do?'
1310	
1311	SIR TOBY BELCH	'Shall I bid him go, and spare not?'
1312	
1313	Clown	'O no, no, no, no, you dare not.'
1314	
1315	SIR TOBY BELCH	Out o' tune, sir: ye lie. Art any more than a
1316	steward? Dost thou think, because thou art
1317	virtuous, there shall be no more cakes and ale?
1318	
1319	Clown	Yes, by Saint Anne, and ginger shall be hot i' the
1320	mouth too.
1321	
1322	SIR TOBY BELCH	Thou'rt i' the right. Go, sir, rub your chain with
1323	crumbs. A stoup of wine, Maria!
1324	
1325	MALVOLIO	Mistress Mary, if you prized my lady's favour at any
1326	thing more than contempt, you would not give means
1327	for this uncivil rule: she shall know of it, by this hand.
1328	
1329	[Exit]
1330	
1331	MARIA	Go shake your ears.
1332	
1333	SIR ANDREW	'Twere as good a deed as to drink when a man's
1334	a-hungry, to challenge him the field, and then to
1335	break promise with him and make a fool of him.
1336	
1337	SIR TOBY BELCH	Do't, knight: I'll write thee a challenge: or I'll
1338	deliver thy indignation to him by word of mouth.
1339	
1340	MARIA	Sweet Sir Toby, be patient for tonight: since the
1341	youth of the count's was today with thy lady, she is
1342	much out of quiet. For Monsieur Malvolio, let me
1343	alone with him: if I do not gull him into a
1344	nayword, and make him a common recreation, do not
1345	think I have wit enough to lie straight in my bed:
1346	I know I can do it.
1347	
1348	SIR TOBY BELCH	Possess us, possess us; tell us something of him.
1349	
1350	MARIA	Marry, sir, sometimes he is a kind of puritan.
1351	
1352	SIR ANDREW	O, if I thought that I'ld beat him like a dog!
1353	
1354	SIR TOBY BELCH	What, for being a puritan? thy exquisite reason,
1355	dear knight?
1356	
1357	SIR ANDREW	I have no exquisite reason for't, but I have reason
1358	good enough.
1359	
1360	MARIA	The devil a puritan that he is, or any thing
1361	constantly, but a time-pleaser; an affectioned ass,
1362	that cons state without book and utters it by great
1363	swarths: the best persuaded of himself, so
1364	crammed, as he thinks, with excellencies, that it is
1365	his grounds of faith that all that look on him love
1366	him; and on that vice in him will my revenge find
1367	notable cause to work.
1368	
1369	SIR TOBY BELCH	What wilt thou do?
1370	
1371	MARIA	I will drop in his way some obscure epistles of
1372	love; wherein, by the colour of his beard, the shape
1373	of his leg, the manner of his gait, the expressure
1374	of his eye, forehead, and complexion, he shall find
1375	himself most feelingly personated. I can write very
1376	like my lady your niece: on a forgotten matter we
1377	can hardly make distinction of our hands.
1378	
1379	SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent! I smell a device.
1380	
1381	SIR ANDREW	I have't in my nose too.
1382	
1383	SIR TOBY BELCH	He shall think, by the letters that thou wilt drop,
1384	that they come from my niece, and that she's in
1385	love with him.
1386	
1387	MARIA	My purpose is, indeed, a horse of that colour.
1388	
1389	SIR ANDREW	And your horse now would make him an ass.
1390	
1391	MARIA	Ass, I doubt not.
1392	
1393	SIR ANDREW	O, 'twill be admirable!
1394	
1395	MARIA	Sport royal, I warrant you: I know my physic will
1396	work with him. I will plant you two, and let the
1397	fool make a third, where he shall find the letter:
1398	observe his construction of it. For this night, to
1399	bed, and dream on the event. Farewell.
1400	
1401	[Exit]
1402	
1403	SIR TOBY BELCH	Good night, Penthesilea.
1404	
1405	SIR ANDREW	Before me, she's a good wench.
1406	
1407	SIR TOBY BELCH	She's a beagle, true-bred, and one that adores me:
1408	what o' that?
1409	
1410	SIR ANDREW	I was adored once too.
1411	
1412	SIR TOBY BELCH	Let's to bed, knight. Thou hadst need send for
1413	more money.
1414	
1415	SIR ANDREW	If I cannot recover your niece, I am a foul way out.
1416	
1417	SIR TOBY BELCH	Send for money, knight: if thou hast her not i'
1418	the end, call me cut.
1419	
1420	SIR ANDREW	If I do not, never trust me, take it how you will.
1421	
1422	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, come, I'll go burn some sack; 'tis too late
1423	to go to bed now: come, knight; come, knight.
1424	
1425	[Exeunt]

1430	TWELFTH NIGHT
1431	
1432	
1433	ACT II
1434	
1435	
1436	
1437	SCENE IV	DUKE ORSINO's palace.
1438	
1439	
1440	[Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and others]
1441	
1442	DUKE ORSINO	Give me some music. Now, good morrow, friends.
1443	Now, good Cesario, but that piece of song,
1444	That old and antique song we heard last night:
1445	Methought it did relieve my passion much,
1446	More than light airs and recollected terms
1447	Of these most brisk and giddy-paced times:
1448	Come, but one verse.
1449	
1450	CURIO	He is not here, so please your lordship that should sing it.
1451	
1452	DUKE ORSINO	Who was it?
1453	
1454	CURIO	Feste, the jester, my lord; a fool that the lady
1455	Olivia's father took much delight in. He is about the house.
1456	
1457	DUKE ORSINO	Seek him out, and play the tune the while.
1458	
1459	[Exit CURIO. Music plays]
1460	
1461	Come hither, boy: if ever thou shalt love,
1462	In the sweet pangs of it remember me;
1463	For such as I am all true lovers are,
1464	Unstaid and skittish in all motions else,
1465	Save in the constant image of the creature
1466	That is beloved. How dost thou like this tune?
1467	
1468	VIOLA	It gives a very echo to the seat
1469	Where Love is throned.
1470	
1471	DUKE ORSINO	Thou dost speak masterly:
1472	My life upon't, young though thou art, thine eye
1473	Hath stay'd upon some favour that it loves:
1474	Hath it not, boy?
1475	
1476	VIOLA	                  A little, by your favour.
1477	
1478	DUKE ORSINO	What kind of woman is't?
1479	
1480	VIOLA	Of your complexion.
1481	
1482	DUKE ORSINO	She is not worth thee, then. What years, i' faith?
1483	
1484	VIOLA	About your years, my lord.
1485	
1486	DUKE ORSINO	Too old by heaven: let still the woman take
1487	An elder than herself: so wears she to him,
1488	So sways she level in her husband's heart:
1489	For, boy, however we do praise ourselves,
1490	Our fancies are more giddy and unfirm,
1491	More longing, wavering, sooner lost and worn,
1492	Than women's are.
1493	
1494	VIOLA	                  I think it well, my lord.
1495	
1496	DUKE ORSINO	Then let thy love be younger than thyself,
1497	Or thy affection cannot hold the bent;
1498	For women are as roses, whose fair flower
1499	Being once display'd, doth fall that very hour.
1500	
1501	VIOLA	And so they are: alas, that they are so;
1502	To die, even when they to perfection grow!
1503	
1504	[Re-enter CURIO and Clown]
1505	
1506	DUKE ORSINO	O, fellow, come, the song we had last night.
1507	Mark it, Cesario, it is old and plain;
1508	The spinsters and the knitters in the sun
1509	And the free maids that weave their thread with bones
1510	Do use to chant it: it is silly sooth,
1511	And dallies with the innocence of love,
1512	Like the old age.
1513	
1514	Clown	Are you ready, sir?
1515	
1516	DUKE ORSINO	Ay; prithee, sing.
1517	
1518	[Music]
1519	
1520	SONG.
1521	Clown	Come away, come away, death,
1522	And in sad cypress let me be laid;
1523	Fly away, fly away breath;
1524	I am slain by a fair cruel maid.
1525	My shroud of white, stuck all with yew,
1526	O, prepare it!
1527	My part of death, no one so true
1528	Did share it.
1529	Not a flower, not a flower sweet
1530	On my black coffin let there be strown;
1531	Not a friend, not a friend greet
1532	My poor corpse, where my bones shall be thrown:
1533	A thousand thousand sighs to save,
1534	Lay me, O, where
1535	Sad true lover never find my grave,
1536	To weep there!
1537	
1538	DUKE ORSINO	There's for thy pains.
1539	
1540	Clown	No pains, sir: I take pleasure in singing, sir.
1541	
1542	DUKE ORSINO	I'll pay thy pleasure then.
1543	
1544	Clown	Truly, sir, and pleasure will be paid, one time or another.
1545	
1546	DUKE ORSINO	Give me now leave to leave thee.
1547	
1548	Clown	Now, the melancholy god protect thee; and the
1549	tailor make thy doublet of changeable taffeta, for
1550	thy mind is a very opal. I would have men of such
1551	constancy put to sea, that their business might be
1552	every thing and their intent every where; for that's
1553	it that always makes a good voyage of nothing. Farewell.
1554	
1555	[Exit]
1556	
1557	DUKE ORSINO	Let all the rest give place.
1558	
1559	[CURIO and Attendants retire]
1560	
1561	Once more, Cesario,
1562	Get thee to yond same sovereign cruelty:
1563	Tell her, my love, more noble than the world,
1564	Prizes not quantity of dirty lands;
1565	The parts that fortune hath bestow'd upon her,
1566	Tell her, I hold as giddily as fortune;
1567	But 'tis that miracle and queen of gems
1568	That nature pranks her in attracts my soul.
1569	
1570	VIOLA	But if she cannot love you, sir?
1571	
1572	DUKE ORSINO	I cannot be so answer'd.
1573	
1574	VIOLA	Sooth, but you must.
1575	Say that some lady, as perhaps there is,
1576	Hath for your love a great a pang of heart
1577	As you have for Olivia: you cannot love her;
1578	You tell her so; must she not then be answer'd?
1579	
1580	DUKE ORSINO	There is no woman's sides
1581	Can bide the beating of so strong a passion
1582	As love doth give my heart; no woman's heart
1583	So big, to hold so much; they lack retention
1584	Alas, their love may be call'd appetite,
1585	No motion of the liver, but the palate,
1586	That suffer surfeit, cloyment and revolt;
1587	But mine is all as hungry as the sea,
1588	And can digest as much: make no compare
1589	Between that love a woman can bear me
1590	And that I owe Olivia.
1591	
1592	VIOLA	Ay, but I know--
1593	
1594	DUKE ORSINO	What dost thou know?
1595	
1596	VIOLA	Too well what love women to men may owe:
1597	In faith, they are as true of heart as we.
1598	My father had a daughter loved a man,
1599	As it might be, perhaps, were I a woman,
1600	I should your lordship.
1601	
1602	DUKE ORSINO	And what's her history?
1603	
1604	VIOLA	A blank, my lord. She never told her love,
1605	But let concealment, like a worm i' the bud,
1606	Feed on her damask cheek: she pined in thought,
1607	And with a green and yellow melancholy
1608	She sat like patience on a monument,
1609	Smiling at grief. Was not this love indeed?
1610	We men may say more, swear more: but indeed
1611	Our shows are more than will; for still we prove
1612	Much in our vows, but little in our love.
1613	
1614	DUKE ORSINO	But died thy sister of her love, my boy?
1615	
1616	VIOLA	I am all the daughters of my father's house,
1617	And all the brothers too: and yet I know not.
1618	Sir, shall I to this lady?
1619	
1620	DUKE ORSINO	Ay, that's the theme.
1621	To her in haste; give her this jewel; say,
1622	My love can give no place, bide no denay.

1637	
1638	
1639	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN]
1640	
1641	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come thy ways, Signior Fabian.
1642	
1643	FABIAN	Nay, I'll come: if I lose a scruple of this sport,
1644	let me be boiled to death with melancholy.
1645	
1646	SIR TOBY BELCH	Wouldst thou not be glad to have the niggardly
1647	rascally sheep-biter come by some notable shame?
1648	
1649	FABIAN	I would exult, man: you know, he brought me out o'
1650	favour with my lady about a bear-baiting here.
1651	
1652	SIR TOBY BELCH	To anger him we'll have the bear again; and we will
1653	fool him black and blue: shall we not, Sir Andrew?
1654	
1655	SIR ANDREW	An we do not, it is pity of our lives.
1656	
1657	SIR TOBY BELCH	Here comes the little villain.
1658	
1659	[Enter MARIA]
1660	
1661	How now, my metal of India!
1662	
1663	MARIA	Get ye all three into the box-tree: Malvolio's
1664	coming down this walk: he has been yonder i' the
1665	sun practising behavior to his own shadow this half
1666	hour: observe him, for the love of mockery; for I
1667	know this letter will make a contemplative idiot of
1668	him. Close, in the name of jesting! Lie thou there,
1669	
1670	[Throws down a letter]
1671	
1672	for here comes the trout that must be caught with tickling.
1673	
1674	[Exit]
1675	
1676	[Enter MALVOLIO]
1677	
1678	MALVOLIO	'Tis but fortune; all is fortune. Maria once told
1679	me she did affect me: and I have heard herself come
1680	thus near, that, should she fancy, it should be one
1681	of my complexion. Besides, she uses me with a more
1682	exalted respect than any one else that follows her.
1683	What should I think on't?
1684	
1685	SIR TOBY BELCH	Here's an overweening rogue!
1686	
1687	FABIAN	O, peace! Contemplation makes a rare turkey-cock
1688	of him: how he jets under his advanced plumes!
1689	
1690	SIR ANDREW	'Slight, I could so beat the rogue!
1691	
1692	SIR TOBY BELCH	Peace, I say.
1693	
1694	MALVOLIO	To be Count Malvolio!
1695	
1696	SIR TOBY BELCH	Ah, rogue!
1697	
1698	SIR ANDREW	Pistol him, pistol him.
1699	
1700	SIR TOBY BELCH	Peace, peace!
1701	
1702	MALVOLIO	There is example for't; the lady of the Strachy
1703	married the yeoman of the wardrobe.
1704	
1705	SIR ANDREW	Fie on him, Jezebel!
1706	
1707	FABIAN	O, peace! now he's deeply in: look how
1708	imagination blows him.
1709	
1710	MALVOLIO	Having been three months married to her, sitting in
1711	my state,--
1712	
1713	SIR TOBY BELCH	O, for a stone-bow, to hit him in the eye!
1714	
1715	MALVOLIO	Calling my officers about me, in my branched velvet
1716	gown; having come from a day-bed, where I have left
1717	Olivia sleeping,--
1718	
1719	SIR TOBY BELCH	Fire and brimstone!
1720	
1721	FABIAN	O, peace, peace!
1722	
1723	MALVOLIO	And then to have the humour of state; and after a
1724	demure travel of regard, telling them I know my
1725	place as I would they should do theirs, to for my
1726	kinsman Toby,--
1727	
1728	SIR TOBY BELCH	Bolts and shackles!
1729	
1730	FABIAN	O peace, peace, peace! now, now.
1731	
1732	MALVOLIO	Seven of my people, with an obedient start, make
1733	out for him: I frown the while; and perchance wind
1734	up watch, or play with my--some rich jewel. Toby
1735	approaches; courtesies there to me,--
1736	
1737	SIR TOBY BELCH	Shall this fellow live?
1738	
1739	FABIAN	Though our silence be drawn from us with cars, yet peace.
1740	
1741	MALVOLIO	I extend my hand to him thus, quenching my familiar
1742	smile with an austere regard of control,--
1743	
1744	SIR TOBY BELCH	And does not Toby take you a blow o' the lips then?
1745	
1746	MALVOLIO	Saying, 'Cousin Toby, my fortunes having cast me on
1747	your niece give me this prerogative of speech,'--
1748	
1749	SIR TOBY BELCH	What, what?
1750	
1751	MALVOLIO	'You must amend your drunkenness.'
1752	
1753	SIR TOBY BELCH	Out, scab!
1754	
1755	FABIAN	Nay, patience, or we break the sinews of our plot.
1756	
1757	MALVOLIO	'Besides, you waste the treasure of your time with
1758	a foolish knight,'--
1759	
1760	SIR ANDREW	That's me, I warrant you.
1761	
1762	MALVOLIO	'One Sir Andrew,'--
1763	
1764	SIR ANDREW	I knew 'twas I; for many do call me fool.
1765	
1766	MALVOLIO	What employment have we here?
1767	
1768	[Taking up the letter]
1769	
1770	FABIAN	Now is the woodcock near the gin.
1771	
1772	SIR TOBY BELCH	O, peace! and the spirit of humour intimate reading
1773	aloud to him!
1774	
1775	MALVOLIO	By my life, this is my lady's hand these be her
1776	very C's, her U's and her T's and thus makes she her
1777	great P's. It is, in contempt of question, her hand.
1778	
1779	SIR ANDREW	Her C's, her U's and her T's: why that?
1780	
1781	MALVOLIO	[Reads]  'To the unknown beloved, this, and my good
1782	wishes:'--her very phrases! By your leave, wax.
1783	Soft! and the impressure her Lucrece, with which she
1784	uses to seal: 'tis my lady. To whom should this be?
1785	
1786	FABIAN	This wins him, liver and all.
1787	
1788	MALVOLIO	[Reads]
1789	
1790	Jove knows I love: But who?
1791	Lips, do not move;
1792	No man must know.
1793	'No man must know.' What follows? the numbers
1794	altered! 'No man must know:' if this should be
1795	thee, Malvolio?
1796	
1797	SIR TOBY BELCH	Marry, hang thee, brock!
1798	
1799	MALVOLIO	[Reads]
1800	I may command where I adore;
1801	But silence, like a Lucrece knife,
1802	With bloodless stroke my heart doth gore:
1803	M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.
1804	
1805	FABIAN	A fustian riddle!
1806	
1807	SIR TOBY BELCH	Excellent wench, say I.
1808	
1809	MALVOLIO	'M, O, A, I, doth sway my life.' Nay, but first, let
1810	me see, let me see, let me see.
1811	
1812	FABIAN	What dish o' poison has she dressed him!
1813	
1814	SIR TOBY BELCH	And with what wing the staniel cheques at it!
1815	
1816	MALVOLIO	'I may command where I adore.' Why, she may command
1817	me: I serve her; she is my lady. Why, this is
1818	evident to any formal capacity; there is no
1819	obstruction in this: and the end,--what should
1820	that alphabetical position portend? If I could make
1821	that resemble something in me,--Softly! M, O, A,
1822	I,--
1823	
1824	SIR TOBY BELCH	O, ay, make up that: he is now at a cold scent.
1825	
1826	FABIAN	Sowter will cry upon't for all this, though it be as
1827	rank as a fox.
1828	
1829	MALVOLIO	M,--Malvolio; M,--why, that begins my name.
1830	
1831	FABIAN	Did not I say he would work it out? the cur is
1832	excellent at faults.
1833	
1834	MALVOLIO	M,--but then there is no consonancy in the sequel;
1835	that suffers under probation A should follow but O does.
1836	
1837	FABIAN	And O shall end, I hope.
1838	
1839	SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, or I'll cudgel him, and make him cry O!
1840	
1841	MALVOLIO	And then I comes behind.
1842	
1843	FABIAN	Ay, an you had any eye behind you, you might see
1844	more detraction at your heels than fortunes before
1845	you.
1846	
1847	MALVOLIO	M, O, A, I; this simulation is not as the former: and
1848	yet, to crush this a little, it would bow to me, for
1849	every one of these letters are in my name. Soft!
1850	here follows prose.
1851	
1852	[Reads]
1853	
1854	'If this fall into thy hand, revolve. In my stars I
1855	am above thee; but be not afraid of greatness: some
1856	are born great, some achieve greatness, and some
1857	have greatness thrust upon 'em. Thy Fates open
1858	their hands; let thy blood and spirit embrace them;
1859	and, to inure thyself to what thou art like to be,
1860	cast thy humble slough and appear fresh. Be
1861	opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants; let
1862	thy tongue tang arguments of state; put thyself into
1863	the trick of singularity: she thus advises thee
1864	that sighs for thee. Remember who commended thy
1865	yellow stockings, and wished to see thee ever
1866	cross-gartered: I say, remember. Go to, thou art
1867	made, if thou desirest to be so; if not, let me see
1868	thee a steward still, the fellow of servants, and
1869	not worthy to touch Fortune's fingers. Farewell.
1870	She that would alter services with thee,
1871	THE FORTUNATE-UNHAPPY.'
1872	Daylight and champaign discovers not more: this is
1873	open. I will be proud, I will read politic authors,
1874	I will baffle Sir Toby, I will wash off gross
1875	acquaintance, I will be point-devise the very man.
1876	I do not now fool myself, to let imagination jade
1877	me; for every reason excites to this, that my lady
1878	loves me. She did commend my yellow stockings of
1879	late, she did praise my leg being cross-gartered;
1880	and in this she manifests herself to my love, and
1881	with a kind of injunction drives me to these habits
1882	of her liking. I thank my stars I am happy. I will
1883	be strange, stout, in yellow stockings, and
1884	cross-gartered, even with the swiftness of putting
1885	on. Jove and my stars be praised! Here is yet a
1886	postscript.
1887	
1888	[Reads]
1889	
1890	'Thou canst not choose but know who I am. If thou
1891	entertainest my love, let it appear in thy smiling;
1892	thy smiles become thee well; therefore in my
1893	presence still smile, dear my sweet, I prithee.'
1894	Jove, I thank thee: I will smile; I will do
1895	everything that thou wilt have me.
1896	
1897	[Exit]
1898	
1899	FABIAN	I will not give my part of this sport for a pension
1900	of thousands to be paid from the Sophy.
1901	
1902	SIR TOBY BELCH	I could marry this wench for this device.
1903	
1904	SIR ANDREW	So could I too.
1905	
1906	SIR TOBY BELCH	And ask no other dowry with her but such another jest.
1907	
1908	SIR ANDREW	Nor I neither.
1909	
1910	FABIAN	Here comes my noble gull-catcher.
1911	
1912	[Re-enter MARIA]
1913	
1914	SIR TOBY BELCH	Wilt thou set thy foot o' my neck?
1915	
1916	SIR ANDREW	Or o' mine either?
1917	
1918	SIR TOBY BELCH	Shall I play my freedom at traytrip, and become thy
1919	bond-slave?
1920	
1921	SIR ANDREW	I' faith, or I either?
1922	
1923	SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, thou hast put him in such a dream, that when
1924	the image of it leaves him he must run mad.
1925	
1926	MARIA	Nay, but say true; does it work upon him?
1927	
1928	SIR TOBY BELCH	Like aqua-vitae with a midwife.
1929	
1930	MARIA	If you will then see the fruits of the sport, mark
1931	his first approach before my lady: he will come to
1932	her in yellow stockings, and 'tis a colour she
1933	abhors, and cross-gartered, a fashion she detests;
1934	and he will smile upon her, which will now be so
1935	unsuitable to her disposition, being addicted to a
1936	melancholy as she is, that it cannot but turn him
1937	into a notable contempt. If you will see it, follow
1938	me.
1939	
1940	SIR TOBY BELCH	To the gates of Tartar, thou most excellent devil of wit!
1941	
1942	SIR ANDREW	I'll make one too.
1943

1949	TWELFTH NIGHT
1950	
1951	
1952	ACT III
1953	
1954	
1955	
1956	SCENE I	OLIVIA's garden.
1957	
1958	
1959	[Enter VIOLA, and Clown with a tabour]
1960	
1961	VIOLA	Save thee, friend, and thy music: dost thou live by
1962	thy tabour?
1963	
1964	Clown	No, sir, I live by the church.
1965	
1966	VIOLA	Art thou a churchman?
1967	
1968	Clown	No such matter, sir: I do live by the church; for
1969	I do live at my house, and my house doth stand by
1970	the church.
1971	
1972	VIOLA	So thou mayst say, the king lies by a beggar, if a
1973	beggar dwell near him; or, the church stands by thy
1974	tabour, if thy tabour stand by the church.
1975	
1976	Clown	You have said, sir. To see this age! A sentence is
1977	but a cheveril glove to a good wit: how quickly the
1978	wrong side may be turned outward!
1979	
1980	VIOLA	Nay, that's certain; they that dally nicely with
1981	words may quickly make them wanton.
1982	
1983	Clown	I would, therefore, my sister had had no name, sir.
1984	
1985	VIOLA	Why, man?
1986	
1987	Clown	Why, sir, her name's a word; and to dally with that
1988	word might make my sister wanton. But indeed words
1989	are very rascals since bonds disgraced them.
1990	
1991	VIOLA	Thy reason, man?
1992	
1993	Clown	Troth, sir, I can yield you none without words; and
1994	words are grown so false, I am loath to prove
1995	reason with them.
1996	
1997	VIOLA	I warrant thou art a merry fellow and carest for nothing.
1998	
1999	Clown	Not so, sir, I do care for something; but in my
2000	conscience, sir, I do not care for you: if that be
2001	to care for nothing, sir, I would it would make you invisible.
2002	
2003	VIOLA	Art not thou the Lady Olivia's fool?
2004	
2005	Clown	No, indeed, sir; the Lady Olivia has no folly: she
2006	will keep no fool, sir, till she be married; and
2007	fools are as like husbands as pilchards are to
2008	herrings; the husband's the bigger: I am indeed not
2009	her fool, but her corrupter of words.
2010	
2011	VIOLA	I saw thee late at the Count Orsino's.
2012	
2013	Clown	Foolery, sir, does walk about the orb like the sun,
2014	it shines every where. I would be sorry, sir, but
2015	the fool should be as oft with your master as with
2016	my mistress: I think I saw your wisdom there.
2017	
2018	VIOLA	Nay, an thou pass upon me, I'll no more with thee.
2019	Hold, there's expenses for thee.
2020	
2021	Clown	Now Jove, in his next commodity of hair, send thee a beard!
2022	
2023	VIOLA	By my troth, I'll tell thee, I am almost sick for
2024	one;
2025	
2026	[Aside]
2027	
2028	though I would not have it grow on my chin. Is thy
2029	lady within?
2030	
2031	Clown	Would not a pair of these have bred, sir?
2032	
2033	VIOLA	Yes, being kept together and put to use.
2034	
2035	Clown	I would play Lord Pandarus of Phrygia, sir, to bring
2036	a Cressida to this Troilus.
2037	
2038	VIOLA	I understand you, sir; 'tis well begged.
2039	
2040	Clown	The matter, I hope, is not great, sir, begging but
2041	a beggar: Cressida was a beggar. My lady is
2042	within, sir. I will construe to them whence you
2043	come; who you are and what you would are out of my
2044	welkin, I might say 'element,' but the word is over-worn.
2045	
2046	[Exit]
2047	
2048	VIOLA	This fellow is wise enough to play the fool;
2049	And to do that well craves a kind of wit:
2050	He must observe their mood on whom he jests,
2051	The quality of persons, and the time,
2052	And, like the haggard, cheque at every feather
2053	That comes before his eye. This is a practise
2054	As full of labour as a wise man's art
2055	For folly that he wisely shows is fit;
2056	But wise men, folly-fall'n, quite taint their wit.
2057	
2058	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW]
2059	
2060	SIR TOBY BELCH	Save you, gentleman.
2061	
2062	VIOLA	And you, sir.
2063	
2064	SIR ANDREW	Dieu vous garde, monsieur.
2065	
2066	VIOLA	Et vous aussi; votre serviteur.
2067	
2068	SIR ANDREW	I hope, sir, you are; and I am yours.
2069	
2070	SIR TOBY BELCH	Will you encounter the house? my niece is desirous
2071	you should enter, if your trade be to her.
2072	
2073	VIOLA	I am bound to your niece, sir; I mean, she is the
2074	list of my voyage.
2075	
2076	SIR TOBY BELCH	Taste your legs, sir; put them to motion.
2077	
2078	VIOLA	My legs do better understand me, sir, than I
2079	understand what you mean by bidding me taste my legs.
2080	
2081	SIR TOBY BELCH	I mean, to go, sir, to enter.
2082	
2083	VIOLA	I will answer you with gait and entrance. But we
2084	are prevented.
2085	
2086	[Enter OLIVIA and MARIA]
2087	
2088	Most excellent accomplished lady, the heavens rain
2089	odours on you!
2090	
2091	SIR ANDREW	That youth's a rare courtier: 'Rain odours;' well.
2092	
2093	VIOLA	My matter hath no voice, to your own most pregnant
2094	and vouchsafed ear.
2095	
2096	SIR ANDREW	'Odours,' 'pregnant' and 'vouchsafed:' I'll get 'em
2097	all three all ready.
2098	
2099	OLIVIA	Let the garden door be shut, and leave me to my hearing.
2100	
2101	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and MARIA]
2102	
2103	Give me your hand, sir.
2104	
2105	VIOLA	My duty, madam, and most humble service.
2106	
2107	OLIVIA	What is your name?
2108	
2109	VIOLA	Cesario is your servant's name, fair princess.
2110	
2111	OLIVIA	My servant, sir! 'Twas never merry world
2112	Since lowly feigning was call'd compliment:
2113	You're servant to the Count Orsino, youth.
2114	
2115	VIOLA	And he is yours, and his must needs be yours:
2116	Your servant's servant is your servant, madam.
2117	
2118	OLIVIA	For him, I think not on him: for his thoughts,
2119	Would they were blanks, rather than fill'd with me!
2120	
2121	VIOLA	Madam, I come to whet your gentle thoughts
2122	On his behalf.
2123	
2124	OLIVIA	                  O, by your leave, I pray you,
2125	I bade you never speak again of him:
2126	But, would you undertake another suit,
2127	I had rather hear you to solicit that
2128	Than music from the spheres.
2129	
2130	VIOLA	Dear lady,--
2131	
2132	OLIVIA	Give me leave, beseech you. I did send,
2133	After the last enchantment you did here,
2134	A ring in chase of you: so did I abuse
2135	Myself, my servant and, I fear me, you:
2136	Under your hard construction must I sit,
2137	To force that on you, in a shameful cunning,
2138	Which you knew none of yours: what might you think?
2139	Have you not set mine honour at the stake
2140	And baited it with all the unmuzzled thoughts
2141	That tyrannous heart can think? To one of your receiving
2142	Enough is shown: a cypress, not a bosom,
2143	Hideth my heart. So, let me hear you speak.
2144	
2145	VIOLA	I pity you.
2146	
2147	OLIVIA	          That's a degree to love.
2148	
2149	VIOLA	No, not a grize; for 'tis a vulgar proof,
2150	That very oft we pity enemies.
2151	
2152	OLIVIA	Why, then, methinks 'tis time to smile again.
2153	O, world, how apt the poor are to be proud!
2154	If one should be a prey, how much the better
2155	To fall before the lion than the wolf!
2156	
2157	[Clock strikes]
2158	
2159	The clock upbraids me with the waste of time.
2160	Be not afraid, good youth, I will not have you:
2161	And yet, when wit and youth is come to harvest,
2162	Your were is alike to reap a proper man:
2163	There lies your way, due west.
2164	
2165	VIOLA	Then westward-ho! Grace and good disposition
2166	Attend your ladyship!
2167	You'll nothing, madam, to my lord by me?
2168	
2169	OLIVIA	Stay:
2170	I prithee, tell me what thou thinkest of me.
2171	
2172	VIOLA	That you do think you are not what you are.
2173	
2174	OLIVIA	If I think so, I think the same of you.
2175	
2176	VIOLA	Then think you right: I am not what I am.
2177	
2178	OLIVIA	I would you were as I would have you be!
2179	
2180	VIOLA	Would it be better, madam, than I am?
2181	I wish it might, for now I am your fool.
2182	
2183	OLIVIA	O, what a deal of scorn looks beautiful
2184	In the contempt and anger of his lip!
2185	A murderous guilt shows not itself more soon
2186	Than love that would seem hid: love's night is noon.
2187	Cesario, by the roses of the spring,
2188	By maidhood, honour, truth and every thing,
2189	I love thee so, that, maugre all thy pride,
2190	Nor wit nor reason can my passion hide.
2191	Do not extort thy reasons from this clause,
2192	For that I woo, thou therefore hast no cause,
2193	But rather reason thus with reason fetter,
2194	Love sought is good, but given unsought better.
2195	
2196	VIOLA	By innocence I swear, and by my youth
2197	I have one heart, one bosom and one truth,
2198	And that no woman has; nor never none
2199	Shall mistress be of it, save I alone.
2200	And so adieu, good madam: never more
2201	Will I my master's tears to you deplore.
2202	
2203	OLIVIA	Yet come again; for thou perhaps mayst move
2204	That heart, which now abhors, to like his love.
2205	
2206	[Exeunt]

2217	
2218	SCENE II	OLIVIA's house.
2219	
2220	
2221	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN]
2222	
2223	SIR ANDREW	No, faith, I'll not stay a jot longer.
2224	
2225	SIR TOBY BELCH	Thy reason, dear venom, give thy reason.
2226	
2227	FABIAN	You must needs yield your reason, Sir Andrew.
2228	
2229	SIR ANDREW	Marry, I saw your niece do more favours to the
2230	count's serving-man than ever she bestowed upon me;
2231	I saw't i' the orchard.
2232	
2233	SIR TOBY BELCH	Did she see thee the while, old boy? tell me that.
2234	
2235	SIR ANDREW	As plain as I see you now.
2236	
2237	FABIAN	This was a great argument of love in her toward you.
2238	
2239	SIR ANDREW	'Slight, will you make an ass o' me?
2240	
2241	FABIAN	I will prove it legitimate, sir, upon the oaths of
2242	judgment and reason.
2243	
2244	SIR TOBY BELCH	And they have been grand-jury-men since before Noah
2245	was a sailor.
2246	
2247	FABIAN	She did show favour to the youth in your sight only
2248	to exasperate you, to awake your dormouse valour, to
2249	put fire in your heart and brimstone in your liver.
2250	You should then have accosted her; and with some
2251	excellent jests, fire-new from the mint, you should
2252	have banged the youth into dumbness. This was
2253	looked for at your hand, and this was balked: the
2254	double gilt of this opportunity you let time wash
2255	off, and you are now sailed into the north of my
2256	lady's opinion; where you will hang like an icicle
2257	on a Dutchman's beard, unless you do redeem it by
2258	some laudable attempt either of valour or policy.
2259	
2260	SIR ANDREW	An't be any way, it must be with valour; for policy
2261	I hate: I had as lief be a Brownist as a
2262	politician.
2263	
2264	SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, then, build me thy fortunes upon the basis of
2265	valour. Challenge me the count's youth to fight
2266	with him; hurt him in eleven places: my niece shall
2267	take note of it; and assure thyself, there is no
2268	love-broker in the world can more prevail in man's
2269	commendation with woman than report of valour.
2270	
2271	FABIAN	There is no way but this, Sir Andrew.
2272	
2273	SIR ANDREW	Will either of you bear me a challenge to him?
2274	
2275	SIR TOBY BELCH	Go, write it in a martial hand; be curst and brief;
2276	it is no matter how witty, so it be eloquent and fun
2277	of invention: taunt him with the licence of ink:
2278	if thou thou'st him some thrice, it shall not be
2279	amiss; and as many lies as will lie in thy sheet of
2280	paper, although the sheet were big enough for the
2281	bed of Ware in England, set 'em down: go, about it.
2282	Let there be gall enough in thy ink, though thou
2283	write with a goose-pen, no matter: about it.
2284	
2285	SIR ANDREW	Where shall I find you?
2286	
2287	SIR TOBY BELCH	We'll call thee at the cubiculo: go.
2288	
2289	[Exit SIR ANDREW]
2290	
2291	FABIAN	This is a dear manikin to you, Sir Toby.
2292	
2293	SIR TOBY BELCH	I have been dear to him, lad, some two thousand
2294	strong, or so.
2295	
2296	FABIAN	We shall have a rare letter from him: but you'll
2297	not deliver't?
2298	
2299	SIR TOBY BELCH	Never trust me, then; and by all means stir on the
2300	youth to an answer. I think oxen and wainropes
2301	cannot hale them together. For Andrew, if he were
2302	opened, and you find so much blood in his liver as
2303	will clog the foot of a flea, I'll eat the rest of
2304	the anatomy.
2305	
2306	FABIAN	And his opposite, the youth, bears in his visage no
2307	great presage of cruelty.
2308	
2309	[Enter MARIA]
2310	
2311	SIR TOBY BELCH	Look, where the youngest wren of nine comes.
2312	
2313	MARIA	If you desire the spleen, and will laugh yourself
2314	into stitches, follow me. Yond gull Malvolio is
2315	turned heathen, a very renegado; for there is no
2316	Christian, that means to be saved by believing
2317	rightly, can ever believe such impossible passages
2318	of grossness. He's in yellow stockings.
2319	
2320	SIR TOBY BELCH	And cross-gartered?
2321	
2322	MARIA	Most villanously; like a pedant that keeps a school
2323	i' the church. I have dogged him, like his
2324	murderer. He does obey every point of the letter
2325	that I dropped to betray him: he does smile his
2326	face into more lines than is in the new map with the
2327	augmentation of the Indies: you have not seen such
2328	a thing as 'tis. I can hardly forbear hurling things
2329	at him. I know my lady will strike him: if she do,
2330	he'll smile and take't for a great favour.
2331	
2332	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, bring us, bring us where he is.
2333

2345	
2346	SCENE III	A street.
2347	
2348	
2349	[Enter SEBASTIAN and ANTONIO]
2350	
2351	SEBASTIAN	I would not by my will have troubled you;
2352	But, since you make your pleasure of your pains,
2353	I will no further chide you.
2354	
2355	ANTONIO	I could not stay behind you: my desire,
2356	More sharp than filed steel, did spur me forth;
2357	And not all love to see you, though so much
2358	As might have drawn one to a longer voyage,
2359	But jealousy what might befall your travel,
2360	Being skilless in these parts; which to a stranger,
2361	Unguided and unfriended, often prove
2362	Rough and unhospitable: my willing love,
2363	The rather by these arguments of fear,
2364	Set forth in your pursuit.
2365	
2366	SEBASTIAN	My kind Antonio,
2367	I can no other answer make but thanks,
2368	And thanks; and ever [         ] oft good turns
2369	Are shuffled off with such uncurrent pay:
2370	But, were my worth as is my conscience firm,
2371	You should find better dealing. What's to do?
2372	Shall we go see the reliques of this town?
2373	
2374	ANTONIO	To-morrow, sir: best first go see your lodging.
2375	
2376	SEBASTIAN	I am not weary, and 'tis long to night:
2377	I pray you, let us satisfy our eyes
2378	With the memorials and the things of fame
2379	That do renown this city.
2380	
2381	ANTONIO	Would you'ld pardon me;
2382	I do not without danger walk these streets:
2383	Once, in a sea-fight, 'gainst the count his galleys
2384	I did some service; of such note indeed,
2385	That were I ta'en here it would scarce be answer'd.
2386	
2387	SEBASTIAN	Belike you slew great number of his people.
2388	
2389	ANTONIO	The offence is not of such a bloody nature;
2390	Albeit the quality of the time and quarrel
2391	Might well have given us bloody argument.
2392	It might have since been answer'd in repaying
2393	What we took from them; which, for traffic's sake,
2394	Most of our city did: only myself stood out;
2395	For which, if I be lapsed in this place,
2396	I shall pay dear.
2397	
2398	SEBASTIAN	                  Do not then walk too open.
2399	
2400	ANTONIO	It doth not fit me. Hold, sir, here's my purse.
2401	In the south suburbs, at the Elephant,
2402	Is best to lodge: I will bespeak our diet,
2403	Whiles you beguile the time and feed your knowledge
2404	With viewing of the town: there shall you have me.
2405	
2406	SEBASTIAN	Why I your purse?
2407	
2408	ANTONIO	Haply your eye shall light upon some toy
2409	You have desire to purchase; and your store,
2410	I think, is not for idle markets, sir.
2411	
2412	SEBASTIAN	I'll be your purse-bearer and leave you
2413	For an hour.
2414	
2415	ANTONIO	To the Elephant.
2416	
2417	SEBASTIAN	                  I do remember.

2431	SCENE IV	OLIVIA's garden.
2432	
2433	
2434	[Enter OLIVIA and MARIA]
2435	
2436	OLIVIA	I have sent after him: he says he'll come;
2437	How shall I feast him? what bestow of him?
2438	For youth is bought more oft than begg'd or borrow'd.
2439	I speak too loud.
2440	Where is Malvolio? he is sad and civil,
2441	And suits well for a servant with my fortunes:
2442	Where is Malvolio?
2443	
2444	MARIA	He's coming, madam; but in very strange manner. He
2445	is, sure, possessed, madam.
2446	
2447	OLIVIA	Why, what's the matter? does he rave?
2448	
2449	MARIA	No. madam, he does nothing but smile: your
2450	ladyship were best to have some guard about you, if
2451	he come; for, sure, the man is tainted in's wits.
2452	
2453	OLIVIA	Go call him hither.
2454	
2455	[Exit MARIA]
2456	
2457	I am as mad as he,
2458	If sad and merry madness equal be.
2459	
2460	[Re-enter MARIA, with MALVOLIO]
2461	
2462	How now, Malvolio!
2463	
2464	MALVOLIO	Sweet lady, ho, ho.
2465	
2466	OLIVIA	Smilest thou?
2467	I sent for thee upon a sad occasion.
2468	
2469	MALVOLIO	Sad, lady! I could be sad: this does make some
2470	obstruction in the blood, this cross-gartering; but
2471	what of that? if it please the eye of one, it is
2472	with me as the very true sonnet is, 'Please one, and
2473	please all.'
2474	
2475	OLIVIA	Why, how dost thou, man? what is the matter with thee?
2476	
2477	MALVOLIO	Not black in my mind, though yellow in my legs. It
2478	did come to his hands, and commands shall be
2479	executed: I think we do know the sweet Roman hand.
2480	
2481	OLIVIA	Wilt thou go to bed, Malvolio?
2482	
2483	MALVOLIO	To bed! ay, sweet-heart, and I'll come to thee.
2484	
2485	OLIVIA	God comfort thee! Why dost thou smile so and kiss
2486	thy hand so oft?
2487	
2488	MARIA	How do you, Malvolio?
2489	
2490	MALVOLIO	At your request! yes; nightingales answer daws.
2491	
2492	MARIA	Why appear you with this ridiculous boldness before my lady?
2493	
2494	MALVOLIO	'Be not afraid of greatness:' 'twas well writ.
2495	
2496	OLIVIA	What meanest thou by that, Malvolio?
2497	
2498	MALVOLIO	'Some are born great,'--
2499	
2500	OLIVIA	Ha!
2501	
2502	MALVOLIO	'Some achieve greatness,'--
2503	
2504	OLIVIA	What sayest thou?
2505	
2506	MALVOLIO	'And some have greatness thrust upon them.'
2507	
2508	OLIVIA	Heaven restore thee!
2509	
2510	MALVOLIO	'Remember who commended thy yellow stockings,'--
2511	
2512	OLIVIA	Thy yellow stockings!
2513	
2514	MALVOLIO	'And wished to see thee cross-gartered.'
2515	
2516	OLIVIA	Cross-gartered!
2517	
2518	MALVOLIO	'Go to thou art made, if thou desirest to be so;'--
2519	
2520	OLIVIA	Am I made?
2521	
2522	MALVOLIO	'If not, let me see thee a servant still.'
2523	
2524	OLIVIA	Why, this is very midsummer madness.
2525	
2526	[Enter Servant]
2527	
2528	Servant	Madam, the young gentleman of the Count Orsino's is
2529	returned: I could hardly entreat him back: he
2530	attends your ladyship's pleasure.
2531	
2532	OLIVIA	I'll come to him.
2533	
2534	[Exit Servant]
2535	
2536	Good Maria, let this fellow be looked to. Where's
2537	my cousin Toby? Let some of my people have a special
2538	care of him: I would not have him miscarry for the
2539	half of my dowry.
2540	
2541	[Exeunt OLIVIA and MARIA]
2542	
2543	MALVOLIO	O, ho! do you come near me now? no worse man than
2544	Sir Toby to look to me! This concurs directly with
2545	the letter: she sends him on purpose, that I may
2546	appear stubborn to him; for she incites me to that
2547	in the letter. 'Cast thy humble slough,' says she;
2548	'be opposite with a kinsman, surly with servants;
2549	let thy tongue tang with arguments of state; put
2550	thyself into the trick of singularity;' and
2551	consequently sets down the manner how; as, a sad
2552	face, a reverend carriage, a slow tongue, in the
2553	habit of some sir of note, and so forth. I have
2554	limed her; but it is Jove's doing, and Jove make me
2555	thankful! And when she went away now, 'Let this
2556	fellow be looked to:' fellow! not Malvolio, nor
2557	after my degree, but fellow. Why, every thing
2558	adheres together, that no dram of a scruple, no
2559	scruple of a scruple, no obstacle, no incredulous
2560	or unsafe circumstance--What can be said? Nothing
2561	that can be can come between me and the full
2562	prospect of my hopes. Well, Jove, not I, is the
2563	doer of this, and he is to be thanked.
2564	
2565	[Re-enter MARIA, with SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN]
2566	
2567	SIR TOBY BELCH	Which way is he, in the name of sanctity? If all
2568	the devils of hell be drawn in little, and Legion
2569	himself possessed him, yet I'll speak to him.
2570	
2571	FABIAN	Here he is, here he is. How is't with you, sir?
2572	how is't with you, man?
2573	
2574	MALVOLIO	Go off; I discard you: let me enjoy my private: go
2575	off.
2576	
2577	MARIA	Lo, how hollow the fiend speaks within him! did not
2578	I tell you? Sir Toby, my lady prays you to have a
2579	care of him.
2580	
2581	MALVOLIO	Ah, ha! does she so?
2582	
2583	SIR TOBY BELCH	Go to, go to; peace, peace; we must deal gently
2584	with him: let me alone. How do you, Malvolio? how
2585	is't with you? What, man! defy the devil:
2586	consider, he's an enemy to mankind.
2587	
2588	MALVOLIO	Do you know what you say?
2589	
2590	MARIA	La you, an you speak ill of the devil, how he takes
2591	it at heart! Pray God, he be not bewitched!
2592	
2593	FABIAN	Carry his water to the wise woman.
2594	
2595	MARIA	Marry, and it shall be done to-morrow morning, if I
2596	live. My lady would not lose him for more than I'll say.
2597	
2598	MALVOLIO	How now, mistress!
2599	
2600	MARIA	O Lord!
2601	
2602	SIR TOBY BELCH	Prithee, hold thy peace; this is not the way: do
2603	you not see you move him? let me alone with him.
2604	
2605	FABIAN	No way but gentleness; gently, gently: the fiend is
2606	rough, and will not be roughly used.
2607	
2608	SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, how now, my bawcock! how dost thou, chuck?
2609	
2610	MALVOLIO	Sir!
2611	
2612	SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, Biddy, come with me. What, man! 'tis not for
2613	gravity to play at cherry-pit with Satan: hang
2614	him, foul collier!
2615	
2616	MARIA	Get him to say his prayers, good Sir Toby, get him to pray.
2617	
2618	MALVOLIO	My prayers, minx!
2619	
2620	MARIA	No, I warrant you, he will not hear of godliness.
2621	
2622	MALVOLIO	Go, hang yourselves all! you are idle shallow
2623	things: I am not of your element: you shall know
2624	more hereafter.
2625	
2626	[Exit]
2627	
2628	SIR TOBY BELCH	Is't possible?
2629	
2630	FABIAN	If this were played upon a stage now, I could
2631	condemn it as an improbable fiction.
2632	
2633	SIR TOBY BELCH	His very genius hath taken the infection of the device, man.
2634	
2635	MARIA	Nay, pursue him now, lest the device take air and taint.
2636	
2637	FABIAN	Why, we shall make him mad indeed.
2638	
2639	MARIA	The house will be the quieter.
2640	
2641	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, we'll have him in a dark room and bound. My
2642	niece is already in the belief that he's mad: we
2643	may carry it thus, for our pleasure and his penance,
2644	till our very pastime, tired out of breath, prompt
2645	us to have mercy on him: at which time we will
2646	bring the device to the bar and crown thee for a
2647	finder of madmen. But see, but see.
2648	
2649	[Enter SIR ANDREW]
2650	
2651	FABIAN	More matter for a May morning.
2652	
2653	SIR ANDREW	Here's the challenge, read it: warrant there's
2654	vinegar and pepper in't.
2655	
2656	FABIAN	Is't so saucy?
2657	
2658	SIR ANDREW	Ay, is't, I warrant him: do but read.
2659	
2660	SIR TOBY BELCH	Give me.
2661	
2662	[Reads]
2663	
2664	'Youth, whatsoever thou art, thou art but a scurvy fellow.'
2665	
2666	FABIAN	Good, and valiant.
2667	
2668	SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Wonder not, nor admire not in thy mind,
2669	why I do call thee so, for I will show thee no reason for't.'
2670	
2671	FABIAN	A good note; that keeps you from the blow of the law.
2672	
2673	SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Thou comest to the lady Olivia, and in my
2674	sight she uses thee kindly: but thou liest in thy
2675	throat; that is not the matter I challenge thee for.'
2676	
2677	FABIAN	Very brief, and to exceeding good sense--less.
2678	
2679	SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'I will waylay thee going home; where if it
2680	be thy chance to kill me,'--
2681	
2682	FABIAN	Good.
2683	
2684	SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Thou killest me like a rogue and a villain.'
2685	
2686	FABIAN	Still you keep o' the windy side of the law: good.
2687	
2688	SIR TOBY BELCH	[Reads]  'Fare thee well; and God have mercy upon
2689	one of our souls! He may have mercy upon mine; but
2690	my hope is better, and so look to thyself. Thy
2691	friend, as thou usest him, and thy sworn enemy,
2692	ANDREW AGUECHEEK.
2693	If this letter move him not, his legs cannot:
2694	I'll give't him.
2695	
2696	MARIA	You may have very fit occasion for't: he is now in
2697	some commerce with my lady, and will by and by depart.
2698	
2699	SIR TOBY BELCH	Go, Sir Andrew: scout me for him at the corner the
2700	orchard like a bum-baily: so soon as ever thou seest
2701	him, draw; and, as thou drawest swear horrible; for
2702	it comes to pass oft that a terrible oath, with a
2703	swaggering accent sharply twanged off, gives manhood
2704	more approbation than ever proof itself would have
2705	earned him. Away!
2706	
2707	SIR ANDREW	Nay, let me alone for swearing.
2708	
2709	[Exit]
2710	
2711	SIR TOBY BELCH	Now will not I deliver his letter: for the behavior
2712	of the young gentleman gives him out to be of good
2713	capacity and breeding; his employment between his
2714	lord and my niece confirms no less: therefore this
2715	letter, being so excellently ignorant, will breed no
2716	terror in the youth: he will find it comes from a
2717	clodpole. But, sir, I will deliver his challenge by
2718	word of mouth; set upon Aguecheek a notable report
2719	of valour; and drive the gentleman, as I know his
2720	youth will aptly receive it, into a most hideous
2721	opinion of his rage, skill, fury and impetuosity.
2722	This will so fright them both that they will kill
2723	one another by the look, like cockatrices.
2724	
2725	[Re-enter OLIVIA, with VIOLA]
2726	
2727	FABIAN	Here he comes with your niece: give them way till
2728	he take leave, and presently after him.
2729	
2730	SIR TOBY BELCH	I will meditate the while upon some horrid message
2731	for a challenge.
2732	
2733	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, FABIAN, and MARIA]
2734	
2735	OLIVIA	I have said too much unto a heart of stone
2736	And laid mine honour too unchary out:
2737	There's something in me that reproves my fault;
2738	But such a headstrong potent fault it is,
2739	That it but mocks reproof.
2740	
2741	VIOLA	With the same 'havior that your passion bears
2742	Goes on my master's grief.
2743	
2744	OLIVIA	Here, wear this jewel for me, 'tis my picture;
2745	Refuse it not; it hath no tongue to vex you;
2746	And I beseech you come again to-morrow.
2747	What shall you ask of me that I'll deny,
2748	That honour saved may upon asking give?
2749	
2750	VIOLA	Nothing but this; your true love for my master.
2751	
2752	OLIVIA	How with mine honour may I give him that
2753	Which I have given to you?
2754	
2755	VIOLA	I will acquit you.
2756	
2757	OLIVIA	Well, come again to-morrow: fare thee well:
2758	A fiend like thee might bear my soul to hell.
2759	
2760	[Exit]
2761	
2762	[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH and FABIAN]
2763	
2764	SIR TOBY BELCH	Gentleman, God save thee.
2765	
2766	VIOLA	And you, sir.
2767	
2768	SIR TOBY BELCH	That defence thou hast, betake thee to't: of what
2769	nature the wrongs are thou hast done him, I know
2770	not; but thy intercepter, full of despite, bloody as
2771	the hunter, attends thee at the orchard-end:
2772	dismount thy tuck, be yare in thy preparation, for
2773	thy assailant is quick, skilful and deadly.
2774	
2775	VIOLA	You mistake, sir; I am sure no man hath any quarrel
2776	to me: my remembrance is very free and clear from
2777	any image of offence done to any man.
2778	
2779	SIR TOBY BELCH	You'll find it otherwise, I assure you: therefore,
2780	if you hold your life at any price, betake you to
2781	your guard; for your opposite hath in him what
2782	youth, strength, skill and wrath can furnish man withal.
2783	
2784	VIOLA	I pray you, sir, what is he?
2785	
2786	SIR TOBY BELCH	He is knight, dubbed with unhatched rapier and on
2787	carpet consideration; but he is a devil in private
2788	brawl: souls and bodies hath he divorced three; and
2789	his incensement at this moment is so implacable,
2790	that satisfaction can be none but by pangs of death
2791	and sepulchre. Hob, nob, is his word; give't or take't.
2792	
2793	VIOLA	I will return again into the house and desire some
2794	conduct of the lady. I am no fighter. I have heard
2795	of some kind of men that put quarrels purposely on
2796	others, to taste their valour: belike this is a man
2797	of that quirk.
2798	
2799	SIR TOBY BELCH	Sir, no; his indignation derives itself out of a
2800	very competent injury: therefore, get you on and
2801	give him his desire. Back you shall not to the
2802	house, unless you undertake that with me which with
2803	as much safety you might answer him: therefore, on,
2804	or strip your sword stark naked; for meddle you
2805	must, that's certain, or forswear to wear iron about you.
2806	
2807	VIOLA	This is as uncivil as strange. I beseech you, do me
2808	this courteous office, as to know of the knight what
2809	my offence to him is: it is something of my
2810	negligence, nothing of my purpose.
2811	
2812	SIR TOBY BELCH	I will do so. Signior Fabian, stay you by this
2813	gentleman till my return.
2814	
2815	[Exit]
2816	
2817	VIOLA	Pray you, sir, do you know of this matter?
2818	
2819	FABIAN	I know the knight is incensed against you, even to a
2820	mortal arbitrement; but nothing of the circumstance more.
2821	
2822	VIOLA	I beseech you, what manner of man is he?
2823	
2824	FABIAN	Nothing of that wonderful promise, to read him by
2825	his form, as you are like to find him in the proof
2826	of his valour. He is, indeed, sir, the most skilful,
2827	bloody and fatal opposite that you could possibly
2828	have found in any part of Illyria. Will you walk
2829	towards him? I will make your peace with him if I
2830	can.
2831	
2832	VIOLA	I shall be much bound to you for't: I am one that
2833	had rather go with sir priest than sir knight: I
2834	care not who knows so much of my mettle.
2835	
2836	[Exeunt]
2837	
2838	[Re-enter SIR TOBY BELCH, with SIR ANDREW]
2839	
2840	SIR TOBY BELCH	Why, man, he's a very devil; I have not seen such a
2841	firago. I had a pass with him, rapier, scabbard and
2842	all, and he gives me the stuck in with such a mortal
2843	motion, that it is inevitable; and on the answer, he
2844	pays you as surely as your feet hit the ground they
2845	step on. They say he has been fencer to the Sophy.
2846	
2847	SIR ANDREW	Pox on't, I'll not meddle with him.
2848	
2849	SIR TOBY BELCH	Ay, but he will not now be pacified: Fabian can
2850	scarce hold him yonder.
2851	
2852	SIR ANDREW	Plague on't, an I thought he had been valiant and so
2853	cunning in fence, I'ld have seen him damned ere I'ld
2854	have challenged him. Let him let the matter slip,
2855	and I'll give him my horse, grey Capilet.
2856	
2857	SIR TOBY BELCH	I'll make the motion: stand here, make a good show
2858	on't: this shall end without the perdition of souls.
2859	
2860	[Aside]
2861	
2862	Marry, I'll ride your horse as well as I ride you.
2863	
2864	[Re-enter FABIAN and VIOLA]
2865	
2866	[To FABIAN]
2867	
2868	I have his horse to take up the quarrel:
2869	I have persuaded him the youth's a devil.
2870	
2871	FABIAN	He is as horribly conceited of him; and pants and
2872	looks pale, as if a bear were at his heels.
2873	
2874	SIR TOBY BELCH	[To VIOLA]  There's no remedy, sir; he will fight
2875	with you for's oath sake: marry, he hath better
2876	bethought him of his quarrel, and he finds that now
2877	scarce to be worth talking of: therefore draw, for
2878	the supportance of his vow; he protests he will not hurt you.
2879	
2880	VIOLA	[Aside]  Pray God defend me! A little thing would
2881	make me tell them how much I lack of a man.
2882	
2883	FABIAN	Give ground, if you see him furious.
2884	
2885	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, Sir Andrew, there's no remedy; the gentleman
2886	will, for his honour's sake, have one bout with you;
2887	he cannot by the duello avoid it: but he has
2888	promised me, as he is a gentleman and a soldier, he
2889	will not hurt you. Come on; to't.
2890	
2891	SIR ANDREW	Pray God, he keep his oath!
2892	
2893	VIOLA	I do assure you, 'tis against my will.
2894	
2895	[They draw]
2896	
2897	[Enter ANTONIO]
2898	
2899	ANTONIO	Put up your sword. If this young gentleman
2900	Have done offence, I take the fault on me:
2901	If you offend him, I for him defy you.
2902	
2903	SIR TOBY BELCH	You, sir! why, what are you?
2904	
2905	ANTONIO	One, sir, that for his love dares yet do more
2906	Than you have heard him brag to you he will.
2907	
2908	SIR TOBY BELCH	Nay, if you be an undertaker, I am for you.
2909	
2910	[They draw]
2911	
2912	[Enter Officers]
2913	
2914	FABIAN	O good Sir Toby, hold! here come the officers.
2915	
2916	SIR TOBY BELCH	I'll be with you anon.
2917	
2918	VIOLA	Pray, sir, put your sword up, if you please.
2919	
2920	SIR ANDREW	Marry, will I, sir; and, for that I promised you,
2921	I'll be as good as my word: he will bear you easily
2922	and reins well.
2923	
2924	First Officer	This is the man; do thy office.
2925	
2926	Second Officer	Antonio, I arrest thee at the suit of Count Orsino.
2927	
2928	ANTONIO	You do mistake me, sir.
2929	
2930	First Officer	No, sir, no jot; I know your favour well,
2931	Though now you have no sea-cap on your head.
2932	Take him away: he knows I know him well.
2933	
2934	ANTONIO	I must obey.
2935	
2936	[To VIOLA]
2937	
2938	This comes with seeking you:
2939	But there's no remedy; I shall answer it.
2940	What will you do, now my necessity
2941	Makes me to ask you for my purse? It grieves me
2942	Much more for what I cannot do for you
2943	Than what befalls myself. You stand amazed;
2944	But be of comfort.
2945	
2946	Second Officer	Come, sir, away.
2947	
2948	ANTONIO	I must entreat of you some of that money.
2949	
2950	VIOLA	What money, sir?
2951	For the fair kindness you have show'd me here,
2952	And, part, being prompted by your present trouble,
2953	Out of my lean and low ability
2954	I'll lend you something: my having is not much;
2955	I'll make division of my present with you:
2956	Hold, there's half my coffer.
2957	
2958	ANTONIO	Will you deny me now?
2959	Is't possible that my deserts to you
2960	Can lack persuasion? Do not tempt my misery,
2961	Lest that it make me so unsound a man
2962	As to upbraid you with those kindnesses
2963	That I have done for you.
2964	
2965	VIOLA	I know of none;
2966	Nor know I you by voice or any feature:
2967	I hate ingratitude more in a man
2968	Than lying, vainness, babbling, drunkenness,
2969	Or any taint of vice whose strong corruption
2970	Inhabits our frail blood.
2971	
2972	ANTONIO	O heavens themselves!
2973	
2974	Second Officer	Come, sir, I pray you, go.
2975	
2976	ANTONIO	Let me speak a little. This youth that you see here
2977	I snatch'd one half out of the jaws of death,
2978	Relieved him with such sanctity of love,
2979	And to his image, which methought did promise
2980	Most venerable worth, did I devotion.
2981	
2982	First Officer	What's that to us? The time goes by: away!
2983	
2984	ANTONIO	But O how vile an idol proves this god
2985	Thou hast, Sebastian, done good feature shame.
2986	In nature there's no blemish but the mind;
2987	None can be call'd deform'd but the unkind:
2988	Virtue is beauty, but the beauteous evil
2989	Are empty trunks o'erflourish'd by the devil.
2990	
2991	First Officer	The man grows mad: away with him! Come, come, sir.
2992	
2993	ANTONIO	Lead me on.
2994	
2995	[Exit with Officers]
2996	
2997	VIOLA	Methinks his words do from such passion fly,
2998	That he believes himself: so do not I.
2999	Prove true, imagination, O, prove true,
3000	That I, dear brother, be now ta'en for you!
3001	
3002	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come hither, knight; come hither, Fabian: we'll
3003	whisper o'er a couplet or two of most sage saws.
3004	
3005	VIOLA	He named Sebastian: I my brother know
3006	Yet living in my glass; even such and so
3007	In favour was my brother, and he went
3008	Still in this fashion, colour, ornament,
3009	For him I imitate: O, if it prove,
3010	Tempests are kind and salt waves fresh in love.
3011	
3012	[Exit]
3013	
3014	SIR TOBY BELCH	A very dishonest paltry boy, and more a coward than
3015	a hare: his dishonesty appears in leaving his
3016	friend here in necessity and denying him; and for
3017	his cowardship, ask Fabian.
3018	
3019	FABIAN	A coward, a most devout coward, religious in it.
3020	
3021	SIR ANDREW	'Slid, I'll after him again and beat him.
3022	
3023	SIR TOBY BELCH	Do; cuff him soundly, but never draw thy sword.
3024	
3025	SIR ANDREW	An I do not,--
3026	
3027	FABIAN	Come, let's see the event.
3028	
3029	SIR TOBY BELCH	I dare lay any money 'twill be nothing yet.

3043	SCENE I	Before OLIVIA's house.
3044	
3045	
3046	[Enter SEBASTIAN and Clown]
3047	
3048	Clown	Will you make me believe that I am not sent for you?
3049	
3050	SEBASTIAN	Go to, go to, thou art a foolish fellow:
3051	Let me be clear of thee.
3052	
3053	Clown	Well held out, i' faith! No, I do not know you; nor
3054	I am not sent to you by my lady, to bid you come
3055	speak with her; nor your name is not Master Cesario;
3056	nor this is not my nose neither. Nothing that is so is so.
3057	
3058	SEBASTIAN	I prithee, vent thy folly somewhere else: Thou
3059	know'st not me.
3060	
3061	Clown	Vent my folly! he has heard that word of some
3062	great man and now applies it to a fool. Vent my
3063	folly! I am afraid this great lubber, the world,
3064	will prove a cockney. I prithee now, ungird thy
3065	strangeness and tell me what I shall vent to my
3066	lady: shall I vent to her that thou art coming?
3067	
3068	SEBASTIAN	I prithee, foolish Greek, depart from me: There's
3069	money for thee: if you tarry longer, I shall give
3070	worse payment.
3071	
3072	Clown	By my troth, thou hast an open hand. These wise men
3073	that give fools money get themselves a good
3074	report--after fourteen years' purchase.
3075	
3076	[Enter SIR ANDREW, SIR TOBY BELCH, and FABIAN]
3077	
3078	SIR ANDREW	Now, sir, have I met you again? there's for you.
3079	
3080	SEBASTIAN	Why, there's for thee, and there, and there. Are all
3081	the people mad?
3082	
3083	SIR TOBY BELCH	Hold, sir, or I'll throw your dagger o'er the house.
3084	
3085	Clown	This will I tell my lady straight: I would not be
3086	in some of your coats for two pence.
3087	
3088	[Exit]
3089	
3090	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come on, sir; hold.
3091	
3092	SIR ANDREW	Nay, let him alone: I'll go another way to work
3093	with him; I'll have an action of battery against
3094	him, if there be any law in Illyria: though I
3095	struck him first, yet it's no matter for that.
3096	
3097	SEBASTIAN	Let go thy hand.
3098	
3099	SIR TOBY BELCH	Come, sir, I will not let you go. Come, my young
3100	soldier, put up your iron: you are well fleshed; come on.
3101	
3102	SEBASTIAN	I will be free from thee. What wouldst thou now? If
3103	thou darest tempt me further, draw thy sword.
3104	
3105	SIR TOBY BELCH	What, what? Nay, then I must have an ounce or two
3106	of this malapert blood from you.
3107	
3108	[Enter OLIVIA]
3109	
3110	OLIVIA	Hold, Toby; on thy life I charge thee, hold!
3111	
3112	SIR TOBY BELCH	Madam!
3113	
3114	OLIVIA	Will it be ever thus? Ungracious wretch,
3115	Fit for the mountains and the barbarous caves,
3116	Where manners ne'er were preach'd! out of my sight!
3117	Be not offended, dear Cesario.
3118	Rudesby, be gone!
3119	
3120	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH, SIR ANDREW, and FABIAN]
3121	
3122	I prithee, gentle friend,
3123	Let thy fair wisdom, not thy passion, sway
3124	In this uncivil and thou unjust extent
3125	Against thy peace. Go with me to my house,
3126	And hear thou there how many fruitless pranks
3127	This ruffian hath botch'd up, that thou thereby
3128	Mayst smile at this: thou shalt not choose but go:
3129	Do not deny. Beshrew his soul for me,
3130	He started one poor heart of mine in thee.
3131	
3132	SEBASTIAN	What relish is in this? how runs the stream?
3133	Or I am mad, or else this is a dream:
3134	Let fancy still my sense in Lethe steep;
3135	If it be thus to dream, still let me sleep!
3136	
3137	OLIVIA	Nay, come, I prithee; would thou'ldst be ruled by me!
3138	
3139	SEBASTIAN	Madam, I will.
3140	
3141	OLIVIA	                  O, say so, and so be!

3155	SCENE II	OLIVIA's house.
3156	
3157	
3158	[Enter MARIA and Clown]
3159	
3160	MARIA	Nay, I prithee, put on this gown and this beard;
3161	make him believe thou art Sir Topas the curate: do
3162	it quickly; I'll call Sir Toby the whilst.
3163	
3164	[Exit]
3165	
3166	Clown	Well, I'll put it on, and I will dissemble myself
3167	in't; and I would I were the first that ever
3168	dissembled in such a gown. I am not tall enough to
3169	become the function well, nor lean enough to be
3170	thought a good student; but to be said an honest man
3171	and a good housekeeper goes as fairly as to say a
3172	careful man and a great scholar. The competitors enter.
3173	
3174	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA]
3175	
3176	SIR TOBY BELCH	Jove bless thee, master Parson.
3177	
3178	Clown	Bonos dies, Sir Toby: for, as the old hermit of
3179	Prague, that never saw pen and ink, very wittily
3180	said to a niece of King Gorboduc, 'That that is is;'
3181	so I, being Master Parson, am Master Parson; for,
3182	what is 'that' but 'that,' and 'is' but 'is'?
3183	
3184	SIR TOBY BELCH	To him, Sir Topas.
3185	
3186	Clown	What, ho, I say! peace in this prison!
3187	
3188	SIR TOBY BELCH	The knave counterfeits well; a good knave.
3189	
3190	MALVOLIO	[Within]  Who calls there?
3191	
3192	Clown	Sir Topas the curate, who comes to visit Malvolio
3193	the lunatic.
3194	
3195	MALVOLIO	Sir Topas, Sir Topas, good Sir Topas, go to my lady.
3196	
3197	Clown	Out, hyperbolical fiend! how vexest thou this man!
3198	talkest thou nothing but of ladies?

3200	SIR TOBY BELCH	Well said, Master Parson.
3201	
3202	MALVOLIO	Sir Topas, never was man thus wronged: good Sir
3203	Topas, do not think I am mad: they have laid me
3204	here in hideous darkness.
3205	
3206	Clown	Fie, thou dishonest Satan! I call thee by the most
3207	modest terms; for I am one of those gentle ones
3208	that will use the devil himself with courtesy:
3209	sayest thou that house is dark?
3210	
3211	MALVOLIO	As hell, Sir Topas.
3212	
3213	Clown	Why it hath bay windows transparent as barricadoes,
3214	and the clearstores toward the south north are as
3215	lustrous as ebony; and yet complainest thou of
3216	obstruction?
3217	
3218	MALVOLIO	I am not mad, Sir Topas: I say to you, this house is dark.
3219	
3220	Clown	Madman, thou errest: I say, there is no darkness
3221	but ignorance; in which thou art more puzzled than
3222	the Egyptians in their fog.
3223	
3224	MALVOLIO	I say, this house is as dark as ignorance, though
3225	ignorance were as dark as hell; and I say, there
3226	was never man thus abused. I am no more mad than you
3227	are: make the trial of it in any constant question.
3228	
3229	Clown	What is the opinion of Pythagoras concerning wild fowl?
3230	
3231	MALVOLIO	That the soul of our grandam might haply inhabit a bird.
3232	
3233	Clown	What thinkest thou of his opinion?
3234	
3235	MALVOLIO	I think nobly of the soul, and no way approve his opinion.
3236	
3237	Clown	Fare thee well. Remain thou still in darkness:
3238	thou shalt hold the opinion of Pythagoras ere I will
3239	allow of thy wits, and fear to kill a woodcock, lest
3240	thou dispossess the soul of thy grandam. Fare thee well.
3241	
3242	MALVOLIO	Sir Topas, Sir Topas!
3243	
3244	SIR TOBY BELCH	My most exquisite Sir Topas!
3245	
3246	Clown	Nay, I am for all waters.
3247	
3248	MARIA	Thou mightst have done this without thy beard and
3249	gown: he sees thee not.
3250	
3251	SIR TOBY BELCH	To him in thine own voice, and bring me word how
3252	thou findest him: I would we were well rid of this
3253	knavery. If he may be conveniently delivered, I
3254	would he were, for I am now so far in offence with
3255	my niece that I cannot pursue with any safety this
3256	sport to the upshot. Come by and by to my chamber.
3257	
3258	[Exeunt SIR TOBY BELCH and MARIA]
3259	
3260	Clown	[Singing]
3261	
3262	'Hey, Robin, jolly Robin,
3263	Tell me how thy lady does.'
3264	
3265	MALVOLIO	Fool!
3266	
3267	Clown	'My lady is unkind, perdy.'
3268	
3269	MALVOLIO	Fool!
3270	
3271	Clown	'Alas, why is she so?'
3272	
3273	MALVOLIO	Fool, I say!
3274	
3275	Clown	'She loves another'--Who calls, ha?
3276	
3277	MALVOLIO	Good fool, as ever thou wilt deserve well at my
3278	hand, help me to a candle, and pen, ink and paper:
3279	as I am a gentleman, I will live to be thankful to
3280	thee for't.
3281	
3282	Clown	Master Malvolio?
3283	
3284	MALVOLIO	Ay, good fool.
3285	
3286	Clown	Alas, sir, how fell you besides your five wits?
3287	
3288	MALVOLIO	Fool, there was never a man so notoriously abused: I
3289	am as well in my wits, fool, as thou art.
3290	
3291	Clown	But as well? then you are mad indeed, if you be no
3292	better in your wits than a fool.
3293	
3294	MALVOLIO	They have here propertied me; keep me in darkness,
3295	send ministers to me, asses, and do all they can to
3296	face me out of my wits.
3297	
3298	Clown	Advise you what you say; the minister is here.
3299	Malvolio, Malvolio, thy wits the heavens restore!
3300	endeavour thyself to sleep, and leave thy vain
3301	bibble babble.
3302	
3303	MALVOLIO	Sir Topas!
3304	
3305	Clown	Maintain no words with him, good fellow. Who, I,
3306	sir? not I, sir. God be wi' you, good Sir Topas.
3307	Merry, amen. I will, sir, I will.
3308	
3309	MALVOLIO	Fool, fool, fool, I say!
3310	
3311	Clown	Alas, sir, be patient. What say you sir? I am
3312	shent for speaking to you.
3313	
3314	MALVOLIO	Good fool, help me to some light and some paper: I
3315	tell thee, I am as well in my wits as any man in Illyria.
3316	
3317	Clown	Well-a-day that you were, sir
3318	
3319	MALVOLIO	By this hand, I am. Good fool, some ink, paper and
3320	light; and convey what I will set down to my lady:
3321	it shall advantage thee more than ever the bearing
3322	of letter did.
3323	
3324	Clown	I will help you to't. But tell me true, are you
3325	not mad indeed? or do you but counterfeit?
3326	
3327	MALVOLIO	Believe me, I am not; I tell thee true.
3328	
3329	Clown	Nay, I'll ne'er believe a madman till I see his
3330	brains. I will fetch you light and paper and ink.
3331	
3332	MALVOLIO	Fool, I'll requite it in the highest degree: I
3333	prithee, be gone.
3334	
3335	Clown	[Singing]
3336	
3337	I am gone, sir,
3338	And anon, sir,
3339	I'll be with you again,
3340	In a trice,
3341	Like to the old Vice,
3342	Your need to sustain;
3343	Who, with dagger of lath,
3344	In his rage and his wrath,
3345	Cries, ah, ha! to the devil:
3346	Like a mad lad,
3347	Pare thy nails, dad;
3348	Adieu, good man devil.
3349

3358	ACT IV
3359	
3360	
3361	
3362	SCENE III	OLIVIA's garden.
3363	
3364	
3365	[Enter SEBASTIAN]
3366	
3367	SEBASTIAN	This is the air; that is the glorious sun;
3368	This pearl she gave me, I do feel't and see't;
3369	And though 'tis wonder that enwraps me thus,
3370	Yet 'tis not madness. Where's Antonio, then?
3371	I could not find him at the Elephant:
3372	Yet there he was; and there I found this credit,
3373	That he did range the town to seek me out.
3374	His counsel now might do me golden service;
3375	For though my soul disputes well with my sense,
3376	That this may be some error, but no madness,
3377	Yet doth this accident and flood of fortune
3378	So far exceed all instance, all discourse,
3379	That I am ready to distrust mine eyes
3380	And wrangle with my reason that persuades me
3381	To any other trust but that I am mad
3382	Or else the lady's mad; yet, if 'twere so,
3383	She could not sway her house, command her followers,
3384	Take and give back affairs and their dispatch
3385	With such a smooth, discreet and stable bearing
3386	As I perceive she does: there's something in't
3387	That is deceiveable. But here the lady comes.
3388	
3389	[Enter OLIVIA and Priest]
3390	
3391	OLIVIA	Blame not this haste of mine. If you mean well,
3392	Now go with me and with this holy man
3393	Into the chantry by: there, before him,
3394	And underneath that consecrated roof,
3395	Plight me the full assurance of your faith;
3396	That my most jealous and too doubtful soul
3397	May live at peace. He shall conceal it
3398	Whiles you are willing it shall come to note,
3399	What time we will our celebration keep
3400	According to my birth. What do you say?
3401	
3402	SEBASTIAN	I'll follow this good man, and go with you;
3403	And, having sworn truth, ever will be true.
3404	
3405	OLIVIA	Then lead the way, good father; and heavens so shine,
3406	That they may fairly note this act of mine!
3407	
3408	[Exeunt]

3413	TWELFTH NIGHT
3414	
3415	
3416	ACT V
3417	
3418	
3419	
3420	SCENE I	Before OLIVIA's house.
3421	
3422	
3423	[Enter Clown and FABIAN]
3424	
3425	FABIAN	Now, as thou lovest me, let me see his letter.
3426	
3427	Clown	Good Master Fabian, grant me another request.
3428	
3429	FABIAN	Any thing.
3430	
3431	Clown	Do not desire to see this letter.
3432	
3433	FABIAN	This is, to give a dog, and in recompense desire my
3434	dog again.
3435	
3436	[Enter DUKE ORSINO, VIOLA, CURIO, and Lords]
3437	
3438	DUKE ORSINO	Belong you to the Lady Olivia, friends?
3439	
3440	Clown	Ay, sir; we are some of her trappings.
3441	
3442	DUKE ORSINO	I know thee well; how dost thou, my good fellow?
3443	
3444	Clown	Truly, sir, the better for my foes and the worse
3445	for my friends.
3446	
3447	DUKE ORSINO	Just the contrary; the better for thy friends.
3448	
3449	Clown	No, sir, the worse.
3450	
3451	DUKE ORSINO	How can that be?
3452	
3453	Clown	Marry, sir, they praise me and make an ass of me;
3454	now my foes tell me plainly I am an ass: so that by
3455	my foes, sir I profit in the knowledge of myself,
3456	and by my friends, I am abused: so that,
3457	conclusions to be as kisses, if your four negatives
3458	make your two affirmatives why then, the worse for
3459	my friends and the better for my foes.
3460	
3461	DUKE ORSINO	Why, this is excellent.
3462	
3463	Clown	By my troth, sir, no; though it please you to be
3464	one of my friends.
3465	
3466	DUKE ORSINO	Thou shalt not be the worse for me: there's gold.
3467	
3468	Clown	But that it would be double-dealing, sir, I would
3469	you could make it another.
3470	
3471	DUKE ORSINO	O, you give me ill counsel.
3472	
3473	Clown	Put your grace in your pocket, sir, for this once,
3474	and let your flesh and blood obey it.
3475	
3476	DUKE ORSINO	Well, I will be so much a sinner, to be a
3477	double-dealer: there's another.
3478	
3479	Clown	Primo, secundo, tertio, is a good play; and the old
3480	saying is, the third pays for all: the triplex,
3481	sir, is a good tripping measure; or the bells of
3482	Saint Bennet, sir, may put you in mind; one, two, three.
3483	
3484	DUKE ORSINO	You can fool no more money out of me at this throw:
3485	if you will let your lady know I am here to speak
3486	with her, and bring her along with you, it may awake
3487	my bounty further.
3488	
3489	Clown	Marry, sir, lullaby to your bounty till I come
3490	again. I go, sir; but I would not have you to think
3491	that my desire of having is the sin of covetousness:
3492	but, as you say, sir, let your bounty take a nap, I
3493	will awake it anon.
3494	
3495	[Exit]
3496	
3497	VIOLA	Here comes the man, sir, that did rescue me.
3498	
3499	[Enter ANTONIO and Officers]
3500	
3501	DUKE ORSINO	That face of his I do remember well;
3502	Yet, when I saw it last, it was besmear'd
3503	As black as Vulcan in the smoke of war:
3504	A bawbling vessel was he captain of,
3505	For shallow draught and bulk unprizable;
3506	With which such scathful grapple did he make
3507	With the most noble bottom of our fleet,
3508	That very envy and the tongue of loss
3509	Cried fame and honour on him. What's the matter?
3510	
3511	First Officer	Orsino, this is that Antonio
3512	That took the Phoenix and her fraught from Candy;
3513	And this is he that did the Tiger board,
3514	When your young nephew Titus lost his leg:
3515	Here in the streets, desperate of shame and state,
3516	In private brabble did we apprehend him.
3517	
3518	VIOLA	He did me kindness, sir, drew on my side;
3519	But in conclusion put strange speech upon me:
3520	I know not what 'twas but distraction.
3521	
3522	DUKE ORSINO	Notable pirate! thou salt-water thief!
3523	What foolish boldness brought thee to their mercies,
3524	Whom thou, in terms so bloody and so dear,
3525	Hast made thine enemies?
3526	
3527	ANTONIO	Orsino, noble sir,
3528	Be pleased that I shake off these names you give me:
3529	Antonio never yet was thief or pirate,
3530	Though I confess, on base and ground enough,
3531	Orsino's enemy. A witchcraft drew me hither:
3532	That most ingrateful boy there by your side,
3533	From the rude sea's enraged and foamy mouth
3534	Did I redeem; a wreck past hope he was:
3535	His life I gave him and did thereto add
3536	My love, without retention or restraint,
3537	All his in dedication; for his sake
3538	Did I expose myself, pure for his love,
3539	Into the danger of this adverse town;
3540	Drew to defend him when he was beset:
3541	Where being apprehended, his false cunning,
3542	Not meaning to partake with me in danger,
3543	Taught him to face me out of his acquaintance,
3544	And grew a twenty years removed thing
3545	While one would wink; denied me mine own purse,
3546	Which I had recommended to his use
3547	Not half an hour before.
3548	
3549	VIOLA	How can this be?
3550	
3551	DUKE ORSINO	When came he to this town?
3552	
3553	ANTONIO	To-day, my lord; and for three months before,
3554	No interim, not a minute's vacancy,
3555	Both day and night did we keep company.
3556	
3557	[Enter OLIVIA and Attendants]
3558	
3559	DUKE ORSINO	Here comes the countess: now heaven walks on earth.
3560	But for thee, fellow; fellow, thy words are madness:
3561	Three months this youth hath tended upon me;
3562	But more of that anon. Take him aside.
3563	
3564	OLIVIA	What would my lord, but that he may not have,
3565	Wherein Olivia may seem serviceable?
3566	Cesario, you do not keep promise with me.
3567	
3568	VIOLA	Madam!
3569	
3570	DUKE ORSINO	Gracious Olivia,--
3571	
3572	OLIVIA	What do you say, Cesario? Good my lord,--
3573	
3574	VIOLA	My lord would speak; my duty hushes me.
3575	
3576	OLIVIA	If it be aught to the old tune, my lord,
3577	It is as fat and fulsome to mine ear
3578	As howling after music.
3579	
3580	DUKE ORSINO	Still so cruel?
3581	
3582	OLIVIA	Still so constant, lord.
3583	
3584	DUKE ORSINO	What, to perverseness? you uncivil lady,
3585	To whose ingrate and unauspicious altars
3586	My soul the faithfull'st offerings hath breathed out
3587	That e'er devotion tender'd! What shall I do?
3588	
3589	OLIVIA	Even what it please my lord, that shall become him.
3590	
3591	DUKE ORSINO	Why should I not, had I the heart to do it,
3592	Like to the Egyptian thief at point of death,
3593	Kill what I love?--a savage jealousy
3594	That sometimes savours nobly. But hear me this:
3595	Since you to non-regardance cast my faith,
3596	And that I partly know the instrument
3597	That screws me from my true place in your favour,
3598	Live you the marble-breasted tyrant still;
3599	But this your minion, whom I know you love,
3600	And whom, by heaven I swear, I tender dearly,
3601	Him will I tear out of that cruel eye,
3602	Where he sits crowned in his master's spite.
3603	Come, boy, with me; my thoughts are ripe in mischief:
3604	I'll sacrifice the lamb that I do love,
3605	To spite a raven's heart within a dove.
3606	
3607	VIOLA	And I, most jocund, apt and willingly,
3608	To do you rest, a thousand deaths would die.
3609	
3610	OLIVIA	Where goes Cesario?
3611	
3612	VIOLA	After him I love
3613	More than I love these eyes, more than my life,
3614	More, by all mores, than e'er I shall love wife.
3615	If I do feign, you witnesses above
3616	Punish my life for tainting of my love!
3617	
3618	OLIVIA	Ay me, detested! how am I beguiled!
3619	
3620	VIOLA	Who does beguile you? who does do you wrong?
3621	
3622	OLIVIA	Hast thou forgot thyself? is it so long?
3623	Call forth the holy father.
3624	
3625	DUKE ORSINO	Come, away!
3626	
3627	OLIVIA	Whither, my lord? Cesario, husband, stay.
3628	
3629	DUKE ORSINO	Husband!
3630	
3631	OLIVIA	       Ay, husband: can he that deny?
3632	
3633	DUKE ORSINO	Her husband, sirrah!
3634	
3635	VIOLA	No, my lord, not I.
3636	
3637	OLIVIA	Alas, it is the baseness of thy fear
3638	That makes thee strangle thy propriety:
3639	Fear not, Cesario; take thy fortunes up;
3640	Be that thou know'st thou art, and then thou art
3641	As great as that thou fear'st.
3642	
3643	[Enter Priest]
3644	
3645	O, welcome, father!
3646	Father, I charge thee, by thy reverence,
3647	Here to unfold, though lately we intended
3648	To keep in darkness what occasion now
3649	Reveals before 'tis ripe, what thou dost know
3650	Hath newly pass'd between this youth and me.
3651	
3652	Priest	A contract of eternal bond of love,
3653	Confirm'd by mutual joinder of your hands,
3654	Attested by the holy close of lips,
3655	Strengthen'd by interchangement of your rings;
3656	And all the ceremony of this compact
3657	Seal'd in my function, by my testimony:
3658	Since when, my watch hath told me, toward my grave
3659	I have travell'd but two hours.
3660	
3661	DUKE ORSINO	O thou dissembling cub! what wilt thou be
3662	When time hath sow'd a grizzle on thy case?
3663	Or will not else thy craft so quickly grow,
3664	That thine own trip shall be thine overthrow?
3665	Farewell, and take her; but direct thy feet
3666	Where thou and I henceforth may never meet.
3667	
3668	VIOLA	My lord, I do protest--
3669	
3670	OLIVIA	O, do not swear!
3671	Hold little faith, though thou hast too much fear.
3672	
3673	[Enter SIR ANDREW]
3674	
3675	SIR ANDREW	For the love of God, a surgeon! Send one presently
3676	to Sir Toby.
3677	
3678	OLIVIA	What's the matter?
3679	
3680	SIR ANDREW	He has broke my head across and has given Sir Toby
3681	a bloody coxcomb too: for the love of God, your
3682	help! I had rather than forty pound I were at home.
3683	
3684	OLIVIA	Who has done this, Sir Andrew?
3685	
3686	SIR ANDREW	The count's gentleman, one Cesario: we took him for
3687	a coward, but he's the very devil incardinate.
3688	
3689	DUKE ORSINO	My gentleman, Cesario?
3690	
3691	SIR ANDREW	'Od's lifelings, here he is! You broke my head for
3692	nothing; and that that I did, I was set on to do't
3693	by Sir Toby.
3694	
3695	VIOLA	Why do you speak to me? I never hurt you:
3696	You drew your sword upon me without cause;
3697	But I bespoke you fair, and hurt you not.
3698	
3699	SIR ANDREW	If a bloody coxcomb be a hurt, you have hurt me: I
3700	think you set nothing by a bloody coxcomb.
3701	
3702	[Enter SIR TOBY BELCH and Clown]
3703	
3704	Here comes Sir Toby halting; you shall hear more:
3705	but if he had not been in drink, he would have
3706	tickled you othergates than he did.
3707	
3708	DUKE ORSINO	How now, gentleman! how is't with you?
3709	
3710	SIR TOBY BELCH	That's all one: has hurt me, and there's the end
3711	on't. Sot, didst see Dick surgeon, sot?
3712	
3713	Clown	O, he's drunk, Sir Toby, an hour agone; his eyes
3714	were set at eight i' the morning.
3715	
3716	SIR TOBY BELCH	Then he's a rogue, and a passy measures panyn: I
3717	hate a drunken rogue.
3718	
3719	OLIVIA	Away with him! Who hath made this havoc with them?
3720	
3721	SIR ANDREW	I'll help you, Sir Toby, because well be dressed together.
3722	
3723	SIR TOBY BELCH	Will you help? an ass-head and a coxcomb and a
3724	knave, a thin-faced knave, a gull!
3725	
3726	OLIVIA	Get him to bed, and let his hurt be look'd to.
3727	
3728	[Exeunt Clown, FABIAN, SIR TOBY BELCH, and SIR ANDREW]
3729	
3730	[Enter SEBASTIAN]
3731	
3732	SEBASTIAN	I am sorry, madam, I have hurt your kinsman:
3733	But, had it been the brother of my blood,
3734	I must have done no less with wit and safety.
3735	You throw a strange regard upon me, and by that
3736	I do perceive it hath offended you:
3737	Pardon me, sweet one, even for the vows
3738	We made each other but so late ago.
3739	
3740	DUKE ORSINO	One face, one voice, one habit, and two persons,
3741	A natural perspective, that is and is not!
3742	
3743	SEBASTIAN	Antonio, O my dear Antonio!
3744	How have the hours rack'd and tortured me,
3745	Since I have lost thee!
3746	
3747	ANTONIO	Sebastian are you?
3748	
3749	SEBASTIAN	                  Fear'st thou that, Antonio?
3750	
3751	ANTONIO	How have you made division of yourself?
3752	An apple, cleft in two, is not more twin
3753	Than these two creatures. Which is Sebastian?
3754	
3755	OLIVIA	Most wonderful!
3756	
3757	SEBASTIAN	Do I stand there? I never had a brother;
3758	Nor can there be that deity in my nature,
3759	Of here and every where. I had a sister,
3760	Whom the blind waves and surges have devour'd.
3761	Of charity, what kin are you to me?
3762	What countryman? what name? what parentage?
3763	
3764	VIOLA	Of Messaline: Sebastian was my father;
3765	Such a Sebastian was my brother too,
3766	So went he suited to his watery tomb:
3767	If spirits can assume both form and suit
3768	You come to fright us.
3769	
3770	SEBASTIAN	A spirit I am indeed;
3771	But am in that dimension grossly clad
3772	Which from the womb I did participate.
3773	Were you a woman, as the rest goes even,
3774	I should my tears let fall upon your cheek,
3775	And say 'Thrice-welcome, drowned Viola!'
3776	
3777	VIOLA	My father had a mole upon his brow.
3778	
3779	SEBASTIAN	And so had mine.
3780	
3781	VIOLA	And died that day when Viola from her birth
3782	Had number'd thirteen years.
3783	
3784	SEBASTIAN	O, that record is lively in my soul!
3785	He finished indeed his mortal act
3786	That day that made my sister thirteen years.
3787	
3788	VIOLA	If nothing lets to make us happy both
3789	But this my masculine usurp'd attire,
3790	Do not embrace me till each circumstance
3791	Of place, time, fortune, do cohere and jump
3792	That I am Viola: which to confirm,
3793	I'll bring you to a captain in this town,
3794	Where lie my maiden weeds; by whose gentle help
3795	I was preserved to serve this noble count.
3796	All the occurrence of my fortune since
3797	Hath been between this lady and this lord.
3798	
3799	SEBASTIAN	[To OLIVIA]  So comes it, lady, you have been mistook:
3800	But nature to her bias drew in that.
3801	You would have been contracted to a maid;
3802	Nor are you therein, by my life, deceived,
3803	You are betroth'd both to a maid and man.
3804	
3805	DUKE ORSINO	Be not amazed; right noble is his blood.
3806	If this be so, as yet the glass seems true,
3807	I shall have share in this most happy wreck.
3808	
3809	[To VIOLA]
3810	
3811	Boy, thou hast said to me a thousand times
3812	Thou never shouldst love woman like to me.
3813	
3814	VIOLA	And all those sayings will I overswear;
3815	And those swearings keep as true in soul
3816	As doth that orbed continent the fire
3817	That severs day from night.
3818	
3819	DUKE ORSINO	Give me thy hand;
3820	And let me see thee in thy woman's weeds.
3821	
3822	VIOLA	The captain that did bring me first on shore
3823	Hath my maid's garments: he upon some action
3824	Is now in durance, at Malvolio's suit,
3825	A gentleman, and follower of my lady's.
3826	
3827	OLIVIA	He shall enlarge him: fetch Malvolio hither:
3828	And yet, alas, now I remember me,
3829	They say, poor gentleman, he's much distract.
3830	
3831	[Re-enter Clown with a letter, and FABIAN]
3832	
3833	A most extracting frenzy of mine own
3834	From my remembrance clearly banish'd his.
3835	How does he, sirrah?
3836	
3837	Clown	Truly, madam, he holds Belzebub at the staves's end as
3838	well as a man in his case may do: has here writ a
3839	letter to you; I should have given't you to-day
3840	morning, but as a madman's epistles are no gospels,
3841	so it skills not much when they are delivered.
3842	
3843	OLIVIA	Open't, and read it.
3844	
3845	Clown	Look then to be well edified when the fool delivers
3846	the madman.
3847	
3848	[Reads]
3849	
3850	'By the Lord, madam,'--
3851	
3852	OLIVIA	How now! art thou mad?
3853	
3854	Clown	No, madam, I do but read madness: an your ladyship
3855	will have it as it ought to be, you must allow Vox.
3856	
3857	OLIVIA	Prithee, read i' thy right wits.
3858	
3859	Clown	So I do, madonna; but to read his right wits is to
3860	read thus: therefore perpend, my princess, and give ear.
3861	
3862	OLIVIA	Read it you, sirrah.
3863	
3864	[To FABIAN]
3865	
3866	FABIAN	[Reads]  'By the Lord, madam, you wrong me, and the
3867	world shall know it: though you have put me into
3868	darkness and given your drunken cousin rule over
3869	me, yet have I the benefit of my senses as well as
3870	your ladyship. I have your own letter that induced
3871	me to the semblance I put on; with the which I doubt
3872	not but to do myself much right, or you much shame.
3873	Think of me as you please. I leave my duty a little
3874	unthought of and speak out of my injury.
3875	THE MADLY-USED MALVOLIO.'
3876	
3877	OLIVIA	Did he write this?
3878	
3879	Clown	Ay, madam.
3880	
3881	DUKE ORSINO	This savours not much of distraction.
3882	
3883	OLIVIA	See him deliver'd, Fabian; bring him hither.
3884	
3885	[Exit FABIAN]
3886	
3887	My lord so please you, these things further
3888	thought on,
3889	To think me as well a sister as a wife,
3890	One day shall crown the alliance on't, so please you,
3891	Here at my house and at my proper cost.
3892	
3893	DUKE ORSINO	Madam, I am most apt to embrace your offer.
3894	
3895	[To VIOLA]
3896	
3897	Your master quits you; and for your service done him,
3898	So much against the mettle of your sex,
3899	So far beneath your soft and tender breeding,
3900	And since you call'd me master for so long,
3901	Here is my hand: you shall from this time be
3902	Your master's mistress.
3903	
3904	OLIVIA	A sister! you are she.
3905	
3906	[Re-enter FABIAN, with MALVOLIO]
3907	
3908	DUKE ORSINO	Is this the madman?
3909	
3910	OLIVIA	Ay, my lord, this same.
3911	How now, Malvolio!
3912	
3913	MALVOLIO	                  Madam, you have done me wrong,
3914	Notorious wrong.
3915	
3916	OLIVIA	                  Have I, Malvolio? no.
3917	
3918	MALVOLIO	Lady, you have. Pray you, peruse that letter.
3919	You must not now deny it is your hand:
3920	Write from it, if you can, in hand or phrase;
3921	Or say 'tis not your seal, nor your invention:
3922	You can say none of this: well, grant it then
3923	And tell me, in the modesty of honour,
3924	Why you have given me such clear lights of favour,
3925	Bade me come smiling and cross-garter'd to you,
3926	To put on yellow stockings and to frown
3927	Upon Sir Toby and the lighter people;
3928	And, acting this in an obedient hope,
3929	Why have you suffer'd me to be imprison'd,
3930	Kept in a dark house, visited by the priest,
3931	And made the most notorious geck and gull
3932	That e'er invention play'd on? tell me why.
3933	
3934	OLIVIA	Alas, Malvolio, this is not my writing,
3935	Though, I confess, much like the character
3936	But out of question 'tis Maria's hand.
3937	And now I do bethink me, it was she
3938	First told me thou wast mad; then camest in smiling,
3939	And in such forms which here were presupposed
3940	Upon thee in the letter. Prithee, be content:
3941	This practise hath most shrewdly pass'd upon thee;
3942	But when we know the grounds and authors of it,
3943	Thou shalt be both the plaintiff and the judge
3944	Of thine own cause.
3945	
3946	FABIAN	Good madam, hear me speak,
3947	And let no quarrel nor no brawl to come
3948	Taint the condition of this present hour,
3949	Which I have wonder'd at. In hope it shall not,
3950	Most freely I confess, myself and Toby
3951	Set this device against Malvolio here,
3952	Upon some stubborn and uncourteous parts
3953	We had conceived against him: Maria writ
3954	The letter at Sir Toby's great importance;
3955	In recompense whereof he hath married her.
3956	How with a sportful malice it was follow'd,
3957	May rather pluck on laughter than revenge;
3958	If that the injuries be justly weigh'd
3959	That have on both sides pass'd.
3960	
3961	OLIVIA	Alas, poor fool, how have they baffled thee!
3962	
3963	Clown	Why, 'some are born great, some achieve greatness,
3964	and some have greatness thrown upon them.' I was
3965	one, sir, in this interlude; one Sir Topas, sir; but
3966	that's all one. 'By the Lord, fool, I am not mad.'
3967	But do you remember? 'Madam, why laugh you at such
3968	a barren rascal? an you smile not, he's gagged:'
3969	and thus the whirligig of time brings in his revenges.
3970	
3971	MALVOLIO	I'll be revenged on the whole pack of you.
3972	
3973	[Exit]
3974	
3975	OLIVIA	He hath been most notoriously abused.
3976	
3977	DUKE ORSINO	Pursue him and entreat him to a peace:
3978	He hath not told us of the captain yet:
3979	When that is known and golden time convents,
3980	A solemn combination shall be made
3981	Of our dear souls. Meantime, sweet sister,
3982	We will not part from hence. Cesario, come;
3983	For so you shall be, while you are a man;
3984	But when in other habits you are seen,
3985	Orsino's mistress and his fancy's queen.
3986	
3987	[Exeunt all, except Clown]
3988	
3989	Clown	[Sings]
3990	
3991	When that I was and a little tiny boy,
3992	With hey, ho, the wind and the rain,
3993	A foolish thing was but a toy,
3994	For the rain it raineth every day.
3995	
3996	But when I came to man's estate,
3997	With hey, ho, &c.
3998	'Gainst knaves and thieves men shut their gate,
3999	For the rain, &c.
4000	
4001	But when I came, alas! to wive,
4002	With hey, ho, &c.
4003	By swaggering could I never thrive,
4004	For the rain, &c.
4005	
4006	But when I came unto my beds,
4007	With hey, ho, &c.
4008	With toss-pots still had drunken heads,
4009	For the rain, &c.
4010	
4011	A great while ago the world begun,
4012	With hey, ho, &c.
4013	But that's all one, our play is done,
4014	And we'll strive to please you every day.
4015	
4016	[Exit]

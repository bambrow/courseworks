82	ACT I
83	
84	
85	[Enter GOWER]
86	
87	[Before the palace of Antioch]
88	
89	To sing a song that old was sung,
90	From ashes ancient Gower is come;
91	Assuming man's infirmities,
92	To glad your ear, and please your eyes.
93	It hath been sung at festivals,
94	On ember-eves and holy-ales;
95	And lords and ladies in their lives
96	Have read it for restoratives:
97	The purchase is to make men glorious;
98	Et bonum quo antiquius, eo melius.
99	If you, born in these latter times,
100	When wit's more ripe, accept my rhymes.
101	And that to hear an old man sing
102	May to your wishes pleasure bring
103	I life would wish, and that I might
104	Waste it for you, like taper-light.
105	This Antioch, then, Antiochus the Great
106	Built up, this city, for his chiefest seat:
107	The fairest in all Syria,
108	I tell you what mine authors say:
109	This king unto him took a fere,
110	Who died and left a female heir,
111	So buxom, blithe, and full of face,
112	As heaven had lent her all his grace;
113	With whom the father liking took,
114	And her to incest did provoke:
115	Bad child; worse father! to entice his own
116	To evil should be done by none:
117	But custom what they did begin
118	Was with long use account no sin.
119	The beauty of this sinful dame
120	Made many princes thither frame,
121	To seek her as a bed-fellow,
122	In marriage-pleasures play-fellow:
123	Which to prevent he made a law,
124	To keep her still, and men in awe,
125	That whoso ask'd her for his wife,
126	His riddle told not, lost his life:
127	So for her many a wight did die,
128	As yon grim looks do testify.
129	What now ensues, to the judgment of your eye
130	I give, my cause who best can justify.

138	
139	
140	ACT I
141	
142	
143	
144	SCENE I	Antioch. A room in the palace.
145	
146	
147	[Enter ANTIOCHUS, Prince PERICLES, and followers]
148	
149	ANTIOCHUS	Young prince of Tyre, you have at large received
150	The danger of the task you undertake.
151	
152	PERICLES	I have, Antiochus, and, with a soul
153	Embolden'd with the glory of her praise,
154	Think death no hazard in this enterprise.
155	
156	ANTIOCHUS	Bring in our daughter, clothed like a bride,
157	For the embracements even of Jove himself;
158	At whose conception, till Lucina reign'd,
159	Nature this dowry gave, to glad her presence,
160	The senate-house of planets all did sit,
161	To knit in her their best perfections.
162	
163	[Music. Enter the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]
164	
165	PERICLES	See where she comes, apparell'd like the spring,
166	Graces her subjects, and her thoughts the king
167	Of every virtue gives renown to men!
168	Her face the book of praises, where is read
169	Nothing but curious pleasures, as from thence
170	Sorrow were ever razed and testy wrath
171	Could never be her mild companion.
172	You gods that made me man, and sway in love,
173	That have inflamed desire in my breast
174	To taste the fruit of yon celestial tree,
175	Or die in the adventure, be my helps,
176	As I am son and servant to your will,
177	To compass such a boundless happiness!
178	
179	ANTIOCHUS	Prince Pericles,--
180	
181	PERICLES	That would be son to great Antiochus.
182	
183	ANTIOCHUS	Before thee stands this fair Hesperides,
184	With golden fruit, but dangerous to be touch'd;
185	For death-like dragons here affright thee hard:
186	Her face, like heaven, enticeth thee to view
187	Her countless glory, which desert must gain;
188	And which, without desert, because thine eye
189	Presumes to reach, all thy whole heap must die.
190	Yon sometimes famous princes, like thyself,
191	Drawn by report, adventurous by desire,
192	Tell thee, with speechless tongues and semblance pale,
193	That without covering, save yon field of stars,
194	Here they stand martyrs, slain in Cupid's wars;
195	And with dead cheeks advise thee to desist
196	For going on death's net, whom none resist.
197	
198	PERICLES	Antiochus, I thank thee, who hath taught
199	My frail mortality to know itself,
200	And by those fearful objects to prepare
201	This body, like to them, to what I must;
202	For death remember'd should be like a mirror,
203	Who tells us life's but breath, to trust it error.
204	I'll make my will then, and, as sick men do
205	Who know the world, see heaven, but, feeling woe,
206	Gripe not at earthly joys as erst they did;
207	So I bequeath a happy peace to you
208	And all good men, as every prince should do;
209	My riches to the earth from whence they came;
210	But my unspotted fire of love to you.
211	
212	[To the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]
213	
214	Thus ready for the way of life or death,
215	I wait the sharpest blow, Antiochus.
216	
217	ANTIOCHUS	Scorning advice, read the conclusion then:
218	Which read and not expounded, 'tis decreed,
219	As these before thee thou thyself shalt bleed.
220	
221	Daughter	Of all say'd yet, mayst thou prove prosperous!
222	Of all say'd yet, I wish thee happiness!
223	
224	PERICLES	Like a bold champion, I assume the lists,
225	Nor ask advice of any other thought
226	But faithfulness and courage.
227	
228	[He reads the riddle]
229	
230	I am no viper, yet I feed
231	On mother's flesh which did me breed.
232	I sought a husband, in which labour
233	I found that kindness in a father:
234	He's father, son, and husband mild;
235	I mother, wife, and yet his child.
236	How they may be, and yet in two,
237	As you will live, resolve it you.
238	
239	Sharp physic is the last: but, O you powers
240	That give heaven countless eyes to view men's acts,
241	Why cloud they not their sights perpetually,
242	If this be true, which makes me pale to read it?
243	Fair glass of light, I loved you, and could still,
244	
245	[Takes hold of the hand of the Daughter of ANTIOCHUS]
246	
247	Were not this glorious casket stored with ill:
248	But I must tell you, now my thoughts revolt
249	For he's no man on whom perfections wait
250	That, knowing sin within, will touch the gate.
251	You are a fair viol, and your sense the strings;
252	Who, finger'd to make man his lawful music,
253	Would draw heaven down, and all the gods, to hearken:
254	But being play'd upon before your time,
255	Hell only danceth at so harsh a chime.
256	Good sooth, I care not for you.
257	
258	ANTIOCHUS	Prince Pericles, touch not, upon thy life.
259	For that's an article within our law,
260	As dangerous as the rest. Your time's expired:
261	Either expound now, or receive your sentence.
262	
263	PERICLES	Great king,
264	Few love to hear the sins they love to act;
265	'Twould braid yourself too near for me to tell it.
266	Who has a book of all that monarchs do,
267	He's more secure to keep it shut than shown:
268	For vice repeated is like the wandering wind.
269	Blows dust in other's eyes, to spread itself;
270	And yet the end of all is bought thus dear,
271	The breath is gone, and the sore eyes see clear:
272	To stop the air would hurt them. The blind mole casts
273	Copp'd hills towards heaven, to tell the earth is throng'd
274	By man's oppression; and the poor worm doth die for't.
275	Kings are earth's gods; in vice their law's
276	their will;
277	And if Jove stray, who dares say Jove doth ill?
278	It is enough you know; and it is fit,
279	What being more known grows worse, to smother it.
280	All love the womb that their first being bred,
281	Then give my tongue like leave to love my head.
282	
283	ANTIOCHUS	[Aside]  Heaven, that I had thy head! he has found
284	the meaning:
285	But I will gloze with him.--Young prince of Tyre,
286	Though by the tenor of our strict edict,
287	Your exposition misinterpreting,
288	We might proceed to cancel of your days;
289	Yet hope, succeeding from so fair a tree
290	As your fair self, doth tune us otherwise:
291	Forty days longer we do respite you;
292	If by which time our secret be undone,
293	This mercy shows we'll joy in such a son:
294	And until then your entertain shall be
295	As doth befit our honour and your worth.
296	
297	[Exeunt all but PERICLES]
298	
299	PERICLES	How courtesy would seem to cover sin,
300	When what is done is like an hypocrite,
301	The which is good in nothing but in sight!
302	If it be true that I interpret false,
303	Then were it certain you were not so bad
304	As with foul incest to abuse your soul;
305	Where now you're both a father and a son,
306	By your untimely claspings with your child,
307	Which pleasure fits an husband, not a father;
308	And she an eater of her mother's flesh,
309	By the defiling of her parent's bed;
310	And both like serpents are, who though they feed
311	On sweetest flowers, yet they poison breed.
312	Antioch, farewell! for wisdom sees, those men
313	Blush not in actions blacker than the night,
314	Will shun no course to keep them from the light.
315	One sin, I know, another doth provoke;
316	Murder's as near to lust as flame to smoke:
317	Poison and treason are the hands of sin,
318	Ay, and the targets, to put off the shame:
319	Then, lest my lie be cropp'd to keep you clear,
320	By flight I'll shun the danger which I fear.
321	
322	[Exit]
323	
324	[Re-enter ANTIOCHUS]
325	
326	ANTIOCHUS	He hath found the meaning, for which we mean
327	To have his head.
328	He must not live to trumpet forth my infamy,
329	Nor tell the world Antiochus doth sin
330	In such a loathed manner;
331	And therefore instantly this prince must die:
332	For by his fall my honour must keep high.
333	Who attends us there?
334	
335	[Enter THALIARD]
336	
337	THALIARD	Doth your highness call?
338	
339	ANTIOCHUS	Thaliard,
340	You are of our chamber, and our mind partakes
341	Her private actions to your secrecy;
342	And for your faithfulness we will advance you.
343	Thaliard, behold, here's poison, and here's gold;
344	We hate the prince of Tyre, and thou must kill him:
345	It fits thee not to ask the reason why,
346	Because we bid it. Say, is it done?
347	
348	THALIARD	My lord,
349	'Tis done.
350	
351	ANTIOCHUS	         Enough.
352	
353	[Enter a Messenger]
354	
355	Let your breath cool yourself, telling your haste.
356	
357	Messenger	My lord, prince Pericles is fled.
358	
359	[Exit]
360	
361	ANTIOCHUS	As thou
362	Wilt live, fly after: and like an arrow shot
363	From a well-experienced archer hits the mark
364	His eye doth level at, so thou ne'er return
365	Unless thou say 'Prince Pericles is dead.'
366	
367	THALIARD	My lord,
368	If I can get him within my pistol's length,
369	I'll make him sure enough: so, farewell to your highness.
370	
371	ANTIOCHUS	Thaliard, adieu!
372	
373	[Exit THALIARD]
374	
375	Till Pericles be dead,
376	My heart can lend no succor to my head.
377	
378	[Exit]
379	
380	
381	
382	
383	PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE
384	
385	
386	ACT I
387	
388	
389	
390	SCENE II	Tyre. A room in the palace.
391	
392	
393	[Enter PERICLES]
394	
395	PERICLES	[To Lords without]  Let none disturb us.--Why should
396	this change of thoughts,
397	The sad companion, dull-eyed melancholy,
398	Be my so used a guest as not an hour,
399	In the day's glorious walk, or peaceful night,
400	The tomb where grief should sleep, can breed me quiet?
401	Here pleasures court mine eyes, and mine eyes shun them,
402	And danger, which I fear'd, is at Antioch,
403	Whose aim seems far too short to hit me here:
404	Yet neither pleasure's art can joy my spirits,
405	Nor yet the other's distance comfort me.
406	Then it is thus: the passions of the mind,
407	That have their first conception by mis-dread,
408	Have after-nourishment and life by care;
409	And what was first but fear what might be done,
410	Grows elder now and cares it be not done.
411	And so with me: the great Antiochus,
412	'Gainst whom I am too little to contend,
413	Since he's so great can make his will his act,
414	Will think me speaking, though I swear to silence;
415	Nor boots it me to say I honour him.
416	If he suspect I may dishonour him:
417	And what may make him blush in being known,
418	He'll stop the course by which it might be known;
419	With hostile forces he'll o'erspread the land,
420	And with the ostent of war will look so huge,
421	Amazement shall drive courage from the state;
422	Our men be vanquish'd ere they do resist,
423	And subjects punish'd that ne'er thought offence:
424	Which care of them, not pity of myself,
425	Who am no more but as the tops of trees,
426	Which fence the roots they grow by and defend them,
427	Makes both my body pine and soul to languish,
428	And punish that before that he would punish.
429	
430	[Enter HELICANUS, with other Lords]
431	
432	First Lord	Joy and all comfort in your sacred breast!
433	
434	Second Lord	And keep your mind, till you return to us,
435	Peaceful and comfortable!
436	
437	HELICANUS	Peace, peace, and give experience tongue.
438	They do abuse the king that flatter him:
439	For flattery is the bellows blows up sin;
440	The thing which is flatter'd, but a spark,
441	To which that blast gives heat and stronger glowing;
442	Whereas reproof, obedient and in order,
443	Fits kings, as they are men, for they may err.
444	When Signior Sooth here does proclaim a peace,
445	He flatters you, makes war upon your life.
446	Prince, pardon me, or strike me, if you please;
447	I cannot be much lower than my knees.
448	
449	PERICLES	All leave us else; but let your cares o'erlook
450	What shipping and what lading's in our haven,
451	And then return to us.
452	
453	[Exeunt Lords]
454	
455	Helicanus, thou
456	Hast moved us: what seest thou in our looks?
457	
458	HELICANUS	An angry brow, dread lord.
459	
460	PERICLES	If there be such a dart in princes' frowns,
461	How durst thy tongue move anger to our face?
462	
463	HELICANUS	How dare the plants look up to heaven, from whence
464	They have their nourishment?
465	
466	PERICLES	Thou know'st I have power
467	To take thy life from thee.
468	
469	HELICANUS	[Kneeling]
470	
471	I have ground the axe myself;
472	Do you but strike the blow.
473	
474	PERICLES	Rise, prithee, rise.
475	Sit down: thou art no flatterer:
476	I thank thee for it; and heaven forbid
477	That kings should let their ears hear their
478	faults hid!
479	Fit counsellor and servant for a prince,
480	Who by thy wisdom makest a prince thy servant,
481	What wouldst thou have me do?
482	
483	HELICANUS	To bear with patience
484	Such griefs as you yourself do lay upon yourself.
485	
486	PERICLES	Thou speak'st like a physician, Helicanus,
487	That minister'st a potion unto me
488	That thou wouldst tremble to receive thyself.
489	Attend me, then: I went to Antioch,
490	Where as thou know'st, against the face of death,
491	I sought the purchase of a glorious beauty.
492	From whence an issue I might propagate,
493	Are arms to princes, and bring joys to subjects.
494	Her face was to mine eye beyond all wonder;
495	The rest--hark in thine ear--as black as incest:
496	Which by my knowledge found, the sinful father
497	Seem'd not to strike, but smooth: but thou
498	know'st this,
499	'Tis time to fear when tyrants seem to kiss.
500	Such fear so grew in me, I hither fled,
501	Under the covering of a careful night,
502	Who seem'd my good protector; and, being here,
503	Bethought me what was past, what might succeed.
504	I knew him tyrannous; and tyrants' fears
505	Decrease not, but grow faster than the years:
506	And should he doubt it, as no doubt he doth,
507	That I should open to the listening air
508	How many worthy princes' bloods were shed,
509	To keep his bed of blackness unlaid ope,
510	To lop that doubt, he'll fill this land with arms,
511	And make pretence of wrong that I have done him:
512	When all, for mine, if I may call offence,
513	Must feel war's blow, who spares not innocence:
514	Which love to all, of which thyself art one,
515	Who now reprovest me for it,--
516	
517	HELICANUS	Alas, sir!
518	
519	PERICLES	Drew sleep out of mine eyes, blood from my cheeks,
520	Musings into my mind, with thousand doubts
521	How I might stop this tempest ere it came;
522	And finding little comfort to relieve them,
523	I thought it princely charity to grieve them.
524	
525	HELICANUS	Well, my lord, since you have given me leave to speak.
526	Freely will I speak. Antiochus you fear,
527	And justly too, I think, you fear the tyrant,
528	Who either by public war or private treason
529	Will take away your life.
530	Therefore, my lord, go travel for a while,
531	Till that his rage and anger be forgot,
532	Or till the Destinies do cut his thread of life.
533	Your rule direct to any; if to me.
534	Day serves not light more faithful than I'll be.
535	
536	PERICLES	I do not doubt thy faith;
537	But should he wrong my liberties in my absence?
538	
539	HELICANUS	We'll mingle our bloods together in the earth,
540	From whence we had our being and our birth.
541	
542	PERICLES	Tyre, I now look from thee then, and to Tarsus
543	Intend my travel, where I'll hear from thee;
544	And by whose letters I'll dispose myself.
545	The care I had and have of subjects' good
546	On thee I lay whose wisdom's strength can bear it.
547	I'll take thy word for faith, not ask thine oath:
548	Who shuns not to break one will sure crack both:
549	But in our orbs we'll live so round and safe,
550	That time of both this truth shall ne'er convince,
551	Thou show'dst a subject's shine, I a true prince.
552

559	
560	
561	ACT I
562	
563	
564	
565	SCENE III	Tyre. An ante-chamber in the palace.
566	
567	
568	[Enter THALIARD]
569	
570	THALIARD	So, this is Tyre, and this the court. Here must I
571	kill King Pericles; and if I do it not, I am sure to
572	be hanged at home: 'tis dangerous. Well, I perceive
573	he was a wise fellow, and had good discretion, that,
574	being bid to ask what he would of the king, desired
575	he might know none of his secrets: now do I see he
576	had some reason for't; for if a king bid a man be a
577	villain, he's bound by the indenture of his oath to
578	be one! Hush! here come the lords of Tyre.
579	
580	[Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES, with other Lords of Tyre]
581	
582	HELICANUS	You shall not need, my fellow peers of Tyre,
583	Further to question me of your king's departure:
584	His seal'd commission, left in trust with me,
585	Doth speak sufficiently he's gone to travel.
586	
587	THALIARD	[Aside]  How! the king gone!
588	
589	HELICANUS	If further yet you will be satisfied,
590	Why, as it were unlicensed of your loves,
591	He would depart, I'll give some light unto you.
592	Being at Antioch--
593	
594	THALIARD	[Aside]          What from Antioch?
595	
596	HELICANUS	Royal Antiochus--on what cause I know not--
597	Took some displeasure at him; at least he judged so:
598	And doubting lest that he had err'd or sinn'd,
599	To show his sorrow, he'ld correct himself;
600	So puts himself unto the shipman's toil,
601	With whom each minute threatens life or death.
602	
603	THALIARD	[Aside]  Well, I perceive
604	I shall not be hang'd now, although I would;
605	But since he's gone, the king's seas must please:
606	He 'scaped the land, to perish at the sea.
607	I'll present myself. Peace to the lords of Tyre!
608	
609	HELICANUS	Lord Thaliard from Antiochus is welcome.
610	
611	THALIARD	From him I come
612	With message unto princely Pericles;
613	But since my landing I have understood
614	Your lord has betook himself to unknown travels,
615	My message must return from whence it came.
616	
617	HELICANUS	We have no reason to desire it,
618	Commended to our master, not to us:
619	Yet, ere you shall depart, this we desire,
620	As friends to Antioch, we may feast in Tyre.

627	PERICLES, PRINCE OF TYRE
628	
629	
630	ACT I
631	
632	
633	
634	SCENE IV	Tarsus. A room in the Governor's house.
635	
636	
637	[Enter CLEON, the governor of Tarsus, with DIONYZA,
638	and others]
639	
640	CLEON	My Dionyza, shall we rest us here,
641	And by relating tales of others' griefs,
642	See if 'twill teach us to forget our own?
643	
644	DIONYZA	That were to blow at fire in hope to quench it;
645	For who digs hills because they do aspire
646	Throws down one mountain to cast up a higher.
647	O my distressed lord, even such our griefs are;
648	Here they're but felt, and seen with mischief's eyes,
649	But like to groves, being topp'd, they higher rise.
650	
651	CLEON	O Dionyza,
652	Who wanteth food, and will not say he wants it,
653	Or can conceal his hunger till he famish?
654	Our tongues and sorrows do sound deep
655	Our woes into the air; our eyes do weep,
656	Till tongues fetch breath that may proclaim them louder;
657	That, if heaven slumber while their creatures want,
658	They may awake their helps to comfort them.
659	I'll then discourse our woes, felt several years,
660	And wanting breath to speak help me with tears.
661	
662	DIONYZA	I'll do my best, sir.
663	
664	CLEON	This Tarsus, o'er which I have the government,
665	A city on whom plenty held full hand,
666	For riches strew'd herself even in the streets;
667	Whose towers bore heads so high they kiss'd the clouds,
668	And strangers ne'er beheld but wondered at;
669	Whose men and dames so jetted and adorn'd,
670	Like one another's glass to trim them by:
671	Their tables were stored full, to glad the sight,
672	And not so much to feed on as delight;
673	All poverty was scorn'd, and pride so great,
674	The name of help grew odious to repeat.
675	
676	DIONYZA	O, 'tis too true.
677	
678	CLEON	But see what heaven can do! By this our change,
679	These mouths, who but of late, earth, sea, and air,
680	Were all too little to content and please,
681	Although they gave their creatures in abundance,
682	As houses are defiled for want of use,
683	They are now starved for want of exercise:
684	Those palates who, not yet two summers younger,
685	Must have inventions to delight the taste,
686	Would now be glad of bread, and beg for it:
687	Those mothers who, to nousle up their babes,
688	Thought nought too curious, are ready now
689	To eat those little darlings whom they loved.
690	So sharp are hunger's teeth, that man and wife
691	Draw lots who first shall die to lengthen life:
692	Here stands a lord, and there a lady weeping;
693	Here many sink, yet those which see them fall
694	Have scarce strength left to give them burial.
695	Is not this true?
696	
697	DIONYZA	Our cheeks and hollow eyes do witness it.
698	
699	CLEON	O, let those cities that of plenty's cup
700	And her prosperities so largely taste,
701	With their superfluous riots, hear these tears!
702	The misery of Tarsus may be theirs.
703	
704	[Enter a Lord]
705	
706	Lord	Where's the lord governor?
707	
708	CLEON	Here.
709	Speak out thy sorrows which thou bring'st in haste,
710	For comfort is too far for us to expect.
711	
712	Lord	We have descried, upon our neighbouring shore,
713	A portly sail of ships make hitherward.
714	
715	CLEON	I thought as much.
716	One sorrow never comes but brings an heir,
717	That may succeed as his inheritor;
718	And so in ours: some neighbouring nation,
719	Taking advantage of our misery,
720	Hath stuff'd these hollow vessels with their power,
721	To beat us down, the which are down already;
722	And make a conquest of unhappy me,
723	Whereas no glory's got to overcome.
724	
725	Lord	That's the least fear; for, by the semblance
726	Of their white flags display'd, they bring us peace,
727	And come to us as favourers, not as foes.
728	
729	CLEON	Thou speak'st like him's untutor'd to repeat:
730	Who makes the fairest show means most deceit.
731	But bring they what they will and what they can,
732	What need we fear?
733	The ground's the lowest, and we are half way there.
734	Go tell their general we attend him here,
735	To know for what he comes, and whence he comes,
736	And what he craves.
737	
738	Lord	I go, my lord.
739	
740	[Exit]
741	
742	CLEON	Welcome is peace, if he on peace consist;
743	If wars, we are unable to resist.
744	
745	[Enter PERICLES with Attendants]
746	
747	PERICLES	Lord governor, for so we hear you are,
748	Let not our ships and number of our men
749	Be like a beacon fired to amaze your eyes.
750	We have heard your miseries as far as Tyre,
751	And seen the desolation of your streets:
752	Nor come we to add sorrow to your tears,
753	But to relieve them of their heavy load;
754	And these our ships, you happily may think
755	Are like the Trojan horse was stuff'd within
756	With bloody veins, expecting overthrow,
757	Are stored with corn to make your needy bread,
758	And give them life whom hunger starved half dead.
759	
760	All	The gods of Greece protect you!
761	And we'll pray for you.
762	
763	PERICLES	Arise, I pray you, rise:
764	We do not look for reverence, but to love,
765	And harbourage for ourself, our ships, and men.
766	
767	CLEON	The which when any shall not gratify,
768	Or pay you with unthankfulness in thought,
769	Be it our wives, our children, or ourselves,
770	The curse of heaven and men succeed their evils!
771	Till when,--the which I hope shall ne'er be seen,--
772	Your grace is welcome to our town and us.
773	
774	PERICLES	Which welcome we'll accept; feast here awhile,
775	Until our stars that frown lend us a smile.

788	[Enter GOWER]
789	
790	GOWER	Here have you seen a mighty king
791	His child, I wis, to incest bring;
792	A better prince and benign lord,
793	That will prove awful both in deed and word.
794	Be quiet then as men should be,
795	Till he hath pass'd necessity.
796	I'll show you those in troubles reign,
797	Losing a mite, a mountain gain.
798	The good in conversation,
799	To whom I give my benison,
800	Is still at Tarsus, where each man
801	Thinks all is writ he speken can;
802	And, to remember what he does,
803	Build his statue to make him glorious:
804	But tidings to the contrary
805	Are brought your eyes; what need speak I?
806	
807	DUMB SHOW.
808	
809	[Enter at one door PERICLES talking with CLEON; all
810	the train with them. Enter at another door a
811	Gentleman, with a letter to PERICLES; PERICLES
812	shows the letter to CLEON; gives the Messenger a
813	reward, and knights him. Exit PERICLES at one
814	door, and CLEON at another]
815	
816	Good Helicane, that stay'd at home,
817	Not to eat honey like a drone
818	From others' labours; for though he strive
819	To killen bad, keep good alive;
820	And to fulfil his prince' desire,
821	Sends word of all that haps in Tyre:
822	How Thaliard came full bent with sin
823	And had intent to murder him;
824	And that in Tarsus was not best
825	Longer for him to make his rest.
826	He, doing so, put forth to seas,
827	Where when men been, there's seldom ease;
828	For now the wind begins to blow;
829	Thunder above and deeps below
830	Make such unquiet, that the ship
831	Should house him safe is wreck'd and split;
832	And he, good prince, having all lost,
833	By waves from coast to coast is tost:
834	All perishen of man, of pelf,
835	Ne aught escapen but himself;
836	Till fortune, tired with doing bad,
837	Threw him ashore, to give him glad:
838	And here he comes. What shall be next,
839	Pardon old Gower,--this longs the text.

853	SCENE I	Pentapolis. An open place by the sea-side.
854	
855	
856	[Enter PERICLES, wet]
857	
858	PERICLES	Yet cease your ire, you angry stars of heaven!
859	Wind, rain, and thunder, remember, earthly man
860	Is but a substance that must yield to you;
861	And I, as fits my nature, do obey you:
862	Alas, the sea hath cast me on the rocks,
863	Wash'd me from shore to shore, and left me breath
864	Nothing to think on but ensuing death:
865	Let it suffice the greatness of your powers
866	To have bereft a prince of all his fortunes;
867	And having thrown him from your watery grave,
868	Here to have death in peace is all he'll crave.
869	
870	[Enter three FISHERMEN]
871	
872	First Fisherman	What, ho, Pilch!
873	
874	Second Fisherman	Ha, come and bring away the nets!
875	
876	First Fisherman	What, Patch-breech, I say!
877	
878	Third Fisherman	What say you, master?
879	
880	First Fisherman	Look how thou stirrest now! come away, or I'll
881	fetch thee with a wanion.
882	
883	Third Fisherman	Faith, master, I am thinking of the poor men that
884	were cast away before us even now.
885	
886	First Fisherman	Alas, poor souls, it grieved my heart to hear what
887	pitiful cries they made to us to help them, when,
888	well-a-day, we could scarce help ourselves.
889	
890	Third Fisherman	Nay, master, said not I as much when I saw the
891	porpus how he bounced and tumbled? they say
892	they're half fish, half flesh: a plague on them,
893	they ne'er come but I look to be washed. Master, I
894	marvel how the fishes live in the sea.
895	
896	First Fisherman	Why, as men do a-land; the great ones eat up the
897	little ones: I can compare our rich misers to
898	nothing so fitly as to a whale; a' plays and
899	tumbles, driving the poor fry before him, and at
900	last devours them all at a mouthful: such whales
901	have I heard on o' the land, who never leave gaping
902	till they've swallowed the whole parish, church,
903	steeple, bells, and all.
904	
905	PERICLES	[Aside]  A pretty moral.
906	
907	Third Fisherman	But, master, if I had been the sexton, I would have
908	been that day in the belfry.
909	
910	Second Fisherman	Why, man?
911	
912	Third Fisherman	Because he should have swallowed me too: and when I
913	had been in his belly, I would have kept such a
914	jangling of the bells, that he should never have
915	left, till he cast bells, steeple, church, and
916	parish up again. But if the good King Simonides
917	were of my mind,--
918	
919	PERICLES	[Aside]  Simonides!
920	
921	Third Fisherman	We would purge the land of these drones, that rob
922	the bee of her honey.
923	
924	PERICLES	[Aside]  How from the finny subject of the sea
925	These fishers tell the infirmities of men;
926	And from their watery empire recollect
927	All that may men approve or men detect!
928	Peace be at your labour, honest fishermen.
929	
930	Second Fisherman	Honest! good fellow, what's that? If it be a day
931	fits you, search out of the calendar, and nobody
932	look after it.
933	
934	PERICLES	May see the sea hath cast upon your coast.
935	
936	Second Fisherman	What a drunken knave was the sea to cast thee in our
937	way!
938	
939	PERICLES	A man whom both the waters and the wind,
940	In that vast tennis-court, have made the ball
941	For them to play upon, entreats you pity him:
942	He asks of you, that never used to beg.
943	
944	First Fisherman	No, friend, cannot you beg? Here's them in our
945	country Greece gets more with begging than we can do
946	with working.
947	
948	Second Fisherman	Canst thou catch any fishes, then?
949	
950	PERICLES	I never practised it.
951	
952	Second Fisherman	Nay, then thou wilt starve, sure; for here's nothing
953	to be got now-a-days, unless thou canst fish for't.
954	
955	PERICLES	What I have been I have forgot to know;
956	But what I am, want teaches me to think on:
957	A man throng'd up with cold: my veins are chill,
958	And have no more of life than may suffice
959	To give my tongue that heat to ask your help;
960	Which if you shall refuse, when I am dead,
961	For that I am a man, pray see me buried.
962	
963	First Fisherman	Die quoth-a? Now gods forbid! I have a gown here;
964	come, put it on; keep thee warm. Now, afore me, a
965	handsome fellow! Come, thou shalt go home, and
966	we'll have flesh for holidays, fish for
967	fasting-days, and moreo'er puddings and flap-jacks,
968	and thou shalt be welcome.
969	
970	PERICLES	I thank you, sir.
971	
972	Second Fisherman	Hark you, my friend; you said you could not beg.
973	
974	PERICLES	I did but crave.
975	
976	Second Fisherman	But crave! Then I'll turn craver too, and so I
977	shall 'scape whipping.
978	
979	PERICLES	Why, are all your beggars whipped, then?
980	
981	Second Fisherman	O, not all, my friend, not all; for if all your
982	beggars were whipped, I would wish no better office
983	than to be beadle. But, master, I'll go draw up the
984	net.
985	
986	[Exit with Third Fisherman]
987	
988	PERICLES	[Aside]  How well this honest mirth becomes their labour!
989	
990	First Fisherman	Hark you, sir, do you know where ye are?
991	
992	PERICLES	Not well.
993	
994	First Fisherman	Why, I'll tell you: this is called Pentapolis, and
995	our king the good Simonides.
996	
997	PERICLES	The good King Simonides, do you call him.
998	
999	First Fisherman	Ay, sir; and he deserves so to be called for his
1000	peaceable reign and good government.
1001	
1002	PERICLES	He is a happy king, since he gains from his subjects
1003	the name of good by his government. How far is his
1004	court distant from this shore?
1005	
1006	First Fisherman	Marry, sir, half a day's journey: and I'll tell
1007	you, he hath a fair daughter, and to-morrow is her
1008	birth-day; and there are princes and knights come
1009	from all parts of the world to just and tourney for her love.
1010	
1011	PERICLES	Were my fortunes equal to my desires, I could wish
1012	to make one there.
1013	
1014	First Fisherman	O, sir, things must be as they may; and what a man
1015	cannot get, he may lawfully deal for--his wife's soul.
1016	
1017	[Re-enter Second and Third Fishermen, drawing up a net]
1018	
1019	Second Fisherman	Help, master, help! here's a fish hangs in the net,
1020	like a poor man's right in the law; 'twill hardly
1021	come out. Ha! bots on't, 'tis come at last, and
1022	'tis turned to a rusty armour.
1023	
1024	PERICLES	An armour, friends! I pray you, let me see it.
1025	Thanks, fortune, yet, that, after all my crosses,
1026	Thou givest me somewhat to repair myself;
1027	And though it was mine own, part of my heritage,
1028	Which my dead father did bequeath to me.
1029	With this strict charge, even as he left his life,
1030	'Keep it, my Pericles; it hath been a shield
1031	Twixt me and death;'--and pointed to this brace;--
1032	'For that it saved me, keep it; in like necessity--
1033	The which the gods protect thee from!--may
1034	defend thee.'
1035	It kept where I kept, I so dearly loved it;
1036	Till the rough seas, that spare not any man,
1037	Took it in rage, though calm'd have given't again:
1038	I thank thee for't: my shipwreck now's no ill,
1039	Since I have here my father's gift in's will.
1040	
1041	First Fisherman	What mean you, sir?
1042	
1043	PERICLES	To beg of you, kind friends, this coat of worth,
1044	For it was sometime target to a king;
1045	I know it by this mark. He loved me dearly,
1046	And for his sake I wish the having of it;
1047	And that you'ld guide me to your sovereign's court,
1048	Where with it I may appear a gentleman;
1049	And if that ever my low fortune's better,
1050	I'll pay your bounties; till then rest your debtor.
1051	
1052	First Fisherman	Why, wilt thou tourney for the lady?
1053	
1054	PERICLES	I'll show the virtue I have borne in arms.
1055	
1056	First Fisherman	Why, do 'e take it, and the gods give thee good on't!
1057	
1058	Second Fisherman	Ay, but hark you, my friend; 'twas we that made up
1059	this garment through the rough seams of the waters:
1060	there are certain condolements, certain vails. I
1061	hope, sir, if you thrive, you'll remember from
1062	whence you had it.
1063	
1064	PERICLES	Believe 't, I will.
1065	By your furtherance I am clothed in steel;
1066	And, spite of all the rapture of the sea,
1067	This jewel holds his building on my arm:
1068	Unto thy value I will mount myself
1069	Upon a courser, whose delightful steps
1070	Shall make the gazer joy to see him tread.
1071	Only, my friend, I yet am unprovided
1072	Of a pair of bases.
1073	
1074	Second Fisherman	We'll sure provide: thou shalt have my best gown to
1075	make thee a pair; and I'll bring thee to the court myself.
1076	
1077	PERICLES	Then honour be but a goal to my will,
1078	This day I'll rise, or else add ill to ill.

1118	'Tis now your honour, daughter, to explain
1119	The labour of each knight in his device.
1120	
1121	THAISA	Which, to preserve mine honour, I'll perform.
1122	
1123	[Enter a Knight; he passes over, and his Squire
1124	presents his shield to the Princess]
1125	
1126	SIMONIDES	Who is the first that doth prefer himself?
1127	
1128	THAISA	A knight of Sparta, my renowned father;
1129	And the device he bears upon his shield
1130	Is a black Ethiope reaching at the sun
1131	The word, 'Lux tua vita mihi.'
1132	
1133	SIMONIDES	He loves you well that holds his life of you.
1134	
1135	[The Second Knight passes over]
1136	
1137	Who is the second that presents himself?
1138	
1139	THAISA	A prince of Macedon, my royal father;
1140	And the device he bears upon his shield
1141	Is an arm'd knight that's conquer'd by a lady;
1142	The motto thus, in Spanish, 'Piu por dulzura que por fuerza.'
1143	
1144	[The Third Knight passes over]
1145	
1146	SIMONIDES	And what's the third?
1147	
1148	THAISA	The third of Antioch;
1149	And his device, a wreath of chivalry;
1150	The word, 'Me pompae provexit apex.'
1151	
1152	[The Fourth Knight passes over]
1153	
1154	SIMONIDES	What is the fourth?
1155	
1156	THAISA	A burning torch that's turned upside down;
1157	The word, 'Quod me alit, me extinguit.'
1158	
1159	SIMONIDES	Which shows that beauty hath his power and will,
1160	Which can as well inflame as it can kill.
1161	
1162	[The Fifth Knight passes over]
1163	
1164	THAISA	The fifth, an hand environed with clouds,
1165	Holding out gold that's by the touchstone tried;
1166	The motto thus, 'Sic spectanda fides.'
1167	
1168	[The Sixth Knight, PERICLES, passes over]
1169	
1170	SIMONIDES	And what's
1171	The sixth and last, the which the knight himself
1172	With such a graceful courtesy deliver'd?
1173	
1174	THAISA	He seems to be a stranger; but his present is
1175	A wither'd branch, that's only green at top;
1176	The motto, 'In hac spe vivo.'
1177	
1178	SIMONIDES	A pretty moral;
1179	From the dejected state wherein he is,
1180	He hopes by you his fortunes yet may flourish.
1181	
1182	First Lord	He had need mean better than his outward show
1183	Can any way speak in his just commend;
1184	For by his rusty outside he appears
1185	To have practised more the whipstock than the lance.
1186	
1187	Second Lord	He well may be a stranger, for he comes
1188	To an honour'd triumph strangely furnished.
1189	
1190	Third Lord	And on set purpose let his armour rust
1191	Until this day, to scour it in the dust.
1192	
1193	SIMONIDES	Opinion's but a fool, that makes us scan
1194	The outward habit by the inward man.
1195	But stay, the knights are coming: we will withdraw
1196	Into the gallery.
1197

1212	SCENE III	The same. A hall of state: a banquet prepared.
1213	
1214	
1215	[Enter SIMONIDES, THAISA, Lords, Attendants, and
1216	Knights, from tilting]
1217	
1218	SIMONIDES	Knights,
1219	To say you're welcome were superfluous.
1220	To place upon the volume of your deeds,
1221	As in a title-page, your worth in arms,
1222	Were more than you expect, or more than's fit,
1223	Since every worth in show commends itself.
1224	Prepare for mirth, for mirth becomes a feast:
1225	You are princes and my guests.
1226	
1227	THAISA	But you, my knight and guest;
1228	To whom this wreath of victory I give,
1229	And crown you king of this day's happiness.
1230	
1231	PERICLES	'Tis more by fortune, lady, than by merit.
1232	
1233	SIMONIDES	Call it by what you will, the day is yours;
1234	And here, I hope, is none that envies it.
1235	In framing an artist, art hath thus decreed,
1236	To make some good, but others to exceed;
1237	And you are her labour'd scholar. Come, queen o'
1238	the feast,--
1239	For, daughter, so you are,--here take your place:
1240	Marshal the rest, as they deserve their grace.
1241	
1242	KNIGHTS	We are honour'd much by good Simonides.
1243	
1244	SIMONIDES	Your presence glads our days: honour we love;
1245	For who hates honour hates the gods above.
1246	
1247	Marshal	Sir, yonder is your place.
1248	
1249	PERICLES	Some other is more fit.
1250	
1251	First Knight	Contend not, sir; for we are gentlemen
1252	That neither in our hearts nor outward eyes
1253	Envy the great nor do the low despise.
1254	
1255	PERICLES	You are right courteous knights.
1256	
1257	SIMONIDES	Sit, sir, sit.
1258	
1259	PERICLES	By Jove, I wonder, that is king of thoughts,
1260	These cates resist me, she but thought upon.
1261	
1262	THAISA	By Juno, that is queen of marriage,
1263	All viands that I eat do seem unsavoury.
1264	Wishing him my meat. Sure, he's a gallant gentleman.
1265	
1266	SIMONIDES	He's but a country gentleman;
1267	Has done no more than other knights have done;
1268	Has broken a staff or so; so let it pass.
1269	
1270	THAISA	To me he seems like diamond to glass.
1271	
1272	PERICLES	Yon king's to me like to my father's picture,
1273	Which tells me in that glory once he was;
1274	Had princes sit, like stars, about his throne,
1275	And he the sun, for them to reverence;
1276	None that beheld him, but, like lesser lights,
1277	Did vail their crowns to his supremacy:
1278	Where now his son's like a glow-worm in the night,
1279	The which hath fire in darkness, none in light:
1280	Whereby I see that Time's the king of men,
1281	He's both their parent, and he is their grave,
1282	And gives them what he will, not what they crave.
1283	
1284	SIMONIDES	What, are you merry, knights?
1285	
1286	Knights	Who can be other in this royal presence?
1287	
1288	SIMONIDES	Here, with a cup that's stored unto the brim,--
1289	As you do love, fill to your mistress' lips,--
1290	We drink this health to you.
1291	
1292	KNIGHTS	We thank your grace.
1293	
1294	SIMONIDES	Yet pause awhile:
1295	Yon knight doth sit too melancholy,
1296	As if the entertainment in our court
1297	Had not a show might countervail his worth.
1298	Note it not you, Thaisa?
1299	
1300	THAISA	What is it
1301	To me, my father?
1302	
1303	SIMONIDES	                  O, attend, my daughter:
1304	Princes in this should live like gods above,
1305	Who freely give to every one that comes
1306	To honour them:
1307	And princes not doing so are like to gnats,
1308	Which make a sound, but kill'd are wonder'd at.
1309	Therefore to make his entrance more sweet,
1310	Here, say we drink this standing-bowl of wine to him.
1311	
1312	THAISA	Alas, my father, it befits not me
1313	Unto a stranger knight to be so bold:
1314	He may my proffer take for an offence,
1315	Since men take women's gifts for impudence.
1316	
1317	SIMONIDES	How!
1318	Do as I bid you, or you'll move me else.
1319	
1320	THAISA	[Aside]  Now, by the gods, he could not please me better.
1321	
1322	SIMONIDES	And furthermore tell him, we desire to know of him,
1323	Of whence he is, his name and parentage.
1324	
1325	THAISA	The king my father, sir, has drunk to you.
1326	
1327	PERICLES	I thank him.
1328	
1329	THAISA	Wishing it so much blood unto your life.
1330	
1331	PERICLES	I thank both him and you, and pledge him freely.
1332	
1333	THAISA	And further he desires to know of you,
1334	Of whence you are, your name and parentage.
1335	
1336	PERICLES	A gentleman of Tyre; my name, Pericles;
1337	My education been in arts and arms;
1338	Who, looking for adventures in the world,
1339	Was by the rough seas reft of ships and men,
1340	And after shipwreck driven upon this shore.
1341	
1342	THAISA	He thanks your grace; names himself Pericles,
1343	A gentleman of Tyre,
1344	Who only by misfortune of the seas
1345	Bereft of ships and men, cast on this shore.
1346	
1347	SIMONIDES	Now, by the gods, I pity his misfortune,
1348	And will awake him from his melancholy.
1349	Come, gentlemen, we sit too long on trifles,
1350	And waste the time, which looks for other revels.
1351	Even in your armours, as you are address'd,
1352	Will very well become a soldier's dance.
1353	I will not have excuse, with saying this
1354	Loud music is too harsh for ladies' heads,
1355	Since they love men in arms as well as beds.
1356	
1357	[The Knights dance]
1358	
1359	So, this was well ask'd,'twas so well perform'd.
1360	Come, sir;
1361	Here is a lady that wants breathing too:
1362	And I have heard, you knights of Tyre
1363	Are excellent in making ladies trip;
1364	And that their measures are as excellent.
1365	
1366	PERICLES	In those that practise them they are, my lord.
1367	
1368	SIMONIDES	O, that's as much as you would be denied
1369	Of your fair courtesy.
1370	
1371	[The Knights and Ladies dance]
1372	
1373	Unclasp, unclasp:
1374	Thanks, gentlemen, to all; all have done well.
1375	
1376	[To PERICLES]
1377	
1378	But you the best. Pages and lights, to conduct
1379	These knights unto their several lodgings!
1380	
1381	[To PERICLES]
1382	
1383	Yours, sir,
1384	We have given order to be next our own.
1385	
1386	PERICLES	I am at your grace's pleasure.
1387	
1388	SIMONIDES	Princes, it is too late to talk of love;
1389	And that's the mark I know you level at:
1390	Therefore each one betake him to his rest;
1391	To-morrow all for speeding do their best.

1407	[Enter HELICANUS and ESCANES]
1408	
1409	HELICANUS	No, Escanes, know this of me,
1410	Antiochus from incest lived not free:
1411	For which, the most high gods not minding longer
1412	To withhold the vengeance that they had in store,
1413	Due to this heinous capital offence,
1414	Even in the height and pride of all his glory,
1415	When he was seated in a chariot
1416	Of an inestimable value, and his daughter with him,
1417	A fire from heaven came and shrivell'd up
1418	Their bodies, even to loathing; for they so stunk,
1419	That all those eyes adored them ere their fall
1420	Scorn now their hand should give them burial.
1421	
1422	ESCANES	'Twas very strange.
1423	
1424	HELICANUS	And yet but justice; for though
1425	This king were great, his greatness was no guard
1426	To bar heaven's shaft, but sin had his reward.
1427	
1428	ESCANES	'Tis very true.
1429	
1430	[Enter two or three Lords]
1431	
1432	First Lord	See, not a man in private conference
1433	Or council has respect with him but he.
1434	
1435	Second Lord	It shall no longer grieve without reproof.
1436	
1437	Third Lord	And cursed be he that will not second it.
1438	
1439	First Lord	Follow me, then. Lord Helicane, a word.
1440	
1441	HELICANUS	With me? and welcome: happy day, my lords.
1442	
1443	First Lord	Know that our griefs are risen to the top,
1444	And now at length they overflow their banks.
1445	
1446	HELICANUS	Your griefs! for what? wrong not your prince you love.
1447	
1448	First Lord	Wrong not yourself, then, noble Helicane;
1449	But if the prince do live, let us salute him,
1450	Or know what ground's made happy by his breath.
1451	If in the world he live, we'll seek him out;
1452	If in his grave he rest, we'll find him there;
1453	And be resolved he lives to govern us,
1454	Or dead, give's cause to mourn his funeral,
1455	And leave us to our free election.
1456	
1457	Second Lord	Whose death indeed's the strongest in our censure:
1458	And knowing this kingdom is without a head,--
1459	Like goodly buildings left without a roof
1460	Soon fall to ruin,--your noble self,
1461	That best know how to rule and how to reign,
1462	We thus submit unto,--our sovereign.
1463	
1464	All	Live, noble Helicane!
1465	
1466	HELICANUS	For honour's cause, forbear your suffrages:
1467	If that you love Prince Pericles, forbear.
1468	Take I your wish, I leap into the seas,
1469	Where's hourly trouble for a minute's ease.
1470	A twelvemonth longer, let me entreat you to
1471	Forbear the absence of your king:
1472	If in which time expired, he not return,
1473	I shall with aged patience bear your yoke.
1474	But if I cannot win you to this love,
1475	Go search like nobles, like noble subjects,
1476	And in your search spend your adventurous worth;
1477	Whom if you find, and win unto return,
1478	You shall like diamonds sit about his crown.
1479	
1480	First Lord	To wisdom he's a fool that will not yield;
1481	And since Lord Helicane enjoineth us,
1482	We with our travels will endeavour us.
1483	
1484	HELICANUS	Then you love us, we you, and we'll clasp hands:

1504	
1505	First Knight	Good morrow to the good Simonides.
1506	
1507	SIMONIDES	Knights, from my daughter this I let you know,
1508	That for this twelvemonth she'll not undertake
1509	A married life.
1510	Her reason to herself is only known,
1511	Which yet from her by no means can I get.
1512	
1513	Second Knight	May we not get access to her, my lord?
1514	
1515	SIMONIDES	'Faith, by no means; she has so strictly tied
1516	Her to her chamber, that 'tis impossible.
1517	One twelve moons more she'll wear Diana's livery;
1518	This by the eye of Cynthia hath she vow'd
1519	And on her virgin honour will not break it.
1520	
1521	Third Knight	Loath to bid farewell, we take our leaves.
1522

1524	
1525	SIMONIDES	So,
1526	They are well dispatch'd; now to my daughter's letter:
1527	She tells me here, she'd wed the stranger knight,
1528	Or never more to view nor day nor light.
1529	'Tis well, mistress; your choice agrees with mine;
1530	I like that well: nay, how absolute she's in't,
1531	Not minding whether I dislike or no!
1532	Well, I do commend her choice;
1533	And will no longer have it be delay'd.
1534	Soft! here he comes: I must dissemble it.
1535	
1536	[Enter PERICLES]
1537	
1538	PERICLES	All fortune to the good Simonides!
1539	
1540	SIMONIDES	To you as much, sir! I am beholding to you
1541	For your sweet music this last night: I do
1542	Protest my ears were never better fed
1543	With such delightful pleasing harmony.
1544	
1545	PERICLES	It is your grace's pleasure to commend;
1546	Not my desert.
1547	
1548	SIMONIDES	Sir, you are music's master.
1549	
1550	PERICLES	The worst of all her scholars, my good lord.
1551	
1552	SIMONIDES	Let me ask you one thing:
1553	What do you think of my daughter, sir?
1554	
1555	PERICLES	A most virtuous princess.
1556	
1557	SIMONIDES	And she is fair too, is she not?
1558	
1559	PERICLES	As a fair day in summer, wondrous fair.
1560	
1561	SIMONIDES	Sir, my daughter thinks very well of you;
1562	Ay, so well, that you must be her master,
1563	And she will be your scholar: therefore look to it.
1564	
1565	PERICLES	I am unworthy for her schoolmaster.
1566	
1567	SIMONIDES	She thinks not so; peruse this writing else.
1568	
1569	PERICLES	[Aside]  What's here?
1570	A letter, that she loves the knight of Tyre!
1571	'Tis the king's subtlety to have my life.
1572	O, seek not to entrap me, gracious lord,
1573	A stranger and distressed gentleman,
1574	That never aim'd so high to love your daughter,
1575	But bent all offices to honour her.
1576	
1577	SIMONIDES	Thou hast bewitch'd my daughter, and thou art
1578	A villain.
1579	
1580	PERICLES	By the gods, I have not:
1581	Never did thought of mine levy offence;
1582	Nor never did my actions yet commence
1583	A deed might gain her love or your displeasure.
1584	
1585	SIMONIDES	Traitor, thou liest.
1586	
1587	PERICLES	Traitor!
1588	
1589	SIMONIDES	Ay, traitor.
1590	
1591	PERICLES	Even in his throat--unless it be the king--
1592	That calls me traitor, I return the lie.
1593	
1594	SIMONIDES	[Aside]  Now, by the gods, I do applaud his courage.
1595	
1596	PERICLES	My actions are as noble as my thoughts,
1597	That never relish'd of a base descent.
1598	I came unto your court for honour's cause,
1599	And not to be a rebel to her state;
1600	And he that otherwise accounts of me,
1601	This sword shall prove he's honour's enemy.
1602	
1603	SIMONIDES	No?
1604	Here comes my daughter, she can witness it.
1605	
1606	[Enter THAISA]
1607	
1608	PERICLES	Then, as you are as virtuous as fair,

1610	Did ere solicit, or my hand subscribe
1611	To any syllable that made love to you.
1612	
1613	THAISA	Why, sir, say if you had,
1614	Who takes offence at that would make me glad?
1615	
1616	SIMONIDES	Yea, mistress, are you so peremptory?
1617	
1618	[Aside]
1619	
1620	I am glad on't with all my heart.--
1621	I'll tame you; I'll bring you in subjection.
1622	Will you, not having my consent,
1623	Bestow your love and your affections
1624	Upon a stranger?
1625	
1626	[Aside]
1627	
1628	who, for aught I know,
1629	May be, nor can I think the contrary,
1630	As great in blood as I myself.--
1631	Therefore hear you, mistress; either frame
1632	Your will to mine,--and you, sir, hear you,
1633	Either be ruled by me, or I will make you--
1634	Man and wife:
1635	Nay, come, your hands and lips must seal it too:
1636	And being join'd, I'll thus your hopes destroy;
1637	And for a further grief,--God give you joy!--
1638	What, are you both pleased?
1639	
1640	THAISA	Yes, if you love me, sir.
1641	
1642	PERICLES	Even as my life, or blood that fosters it.
1643	
1644	SIMONIDES	What, are you both agreed?
1645	
1646	BOTH	Yes, if it please your majesty.
1647	
1648	SIMONIDES	It pleaseth me so well, that I will see you wed;

1663	
1664	GOWER	Now sleep y-slaked hath the rout;
1665	No din but snores the house about,
1666	Made louder by the o'er-fed breast
1667	Of this most pompous marriage-feast.
1668	The cat, with eyne of burning coal,
1669	Now crouches fore the mouse's hole;
1670	And crickets sing at the oven's mouth,
1671	E'er the blither for their drouth.
1672	Hymen hath brought the bride to bed.
1673	Where, by the loss of maidenhead,
1674	A babe is moulded. Be attent,
1675	And time that is so briefly spent
1676	With your fine fancies quaintly eche:
1677	What's dumb in show I'll plain with speech.
1678	
1679	DUMB SHOW.
1680	
1681	[Enter, PERICLES and SIMONIDES at one door, with
1682	Attendants; a Messenger meets them, kneels, and
1683	gives PERICLES a letter: PERICLES shows it
1684	SIMONIDES; the Lords kneel to him. Then enter
1685	THAISA with child, with LYCHORIDA a nurse. The
1686	KING shows her the letter; she rejoices: she and
1687	PERICLES takes leave of her father, and depart with
1688	LYCHORIDA and their Attendants. Then exeunt
1689	SIMONIDES and the rest]
1690	
1691	By many a dern and painful perch
1692	Of Pericles the careful search,
1693	By the four opposing coigns
1694	Which the world together joins,
1695	Is made with all due diligence
1696	That horse and sail and high expense
1697	Can stead the quest. At last from Tyre,
1698	Fame answering the most strange inquire,
1699	To the court of King Simonides
1700	Are letters brought, the tenor these:
1701	Antiochus and his daughter dead;
1702	The men of Tyrus on the head
1703	Of Helicanus would set on
1704	The crown of Tyre, but he will none:
1705	The mutiny he there hastes t' oppress;
1706	Says to 'em, if King Pericles
1707	Come not home in twice six moons,
1708	He, obedient to their dooms,
1709	Will take the crown. The sum of this,
1710	Brought hither to Pentapolis,
1711	Y-ravished the regions round,
1712	And every one with claps can sound,
1713	'Our heir-apparent is a king!
1714	Who dream'd, who thought of such a thing?'
1715	Brief, he must hence depart to Tyre:
1716	His queen with child makes her desire--
1717	Which who shall cross?--along to go:
1718	Omit we all their dole and woe:
1719	Lychorida, her nurse, she takes,
1720	And so to sea. Their vessel shakes
1721	On Neptune's billow; half the flood
1722	Hath their keel cut: but fortune's mood
1723	Varies again; the grisly north
1724	Disgorges such a tempest forth,
1725	That, as a duck for life that dives,
1726	So up and down the poor ship drives:
1727	The lady shrieks, and well-a-near
1728	Does fall in travail with her fear:
1729	And what ensues in this fell storm
1730	Shall for itself itself perform.
1731	I nill relate, action may
1732	Conveniently the rest convey;
1733	Which might not what by me is told.
1734	In your imagination hold
1735	This stage the ship, upon whose deck
1736	The sea-tost Pericles appears to speak.

1753	[Enter PERICLES, on shipboard]
1754	
1755	PERICLES	Thou god of this great vast, rebuke these surges,
1756	Which wash both heaven and hell; and thou, that hast
1757	Upon the winds command, bind them in brass,
1758	Having call'd them from the deep! O, still
1759	Thy deafening, dreadful thunders; gently quench
1760	Thy nimble, sulphurous flashes! O, how, Lychorida,
1761	How does my queen? Thou stormest venomously;
1762	Wilt thou spit all thyself? The seaman's whistle
1763	Is as a whisper in the ears of death,
1764	Unheard. Lychorida!--Lucina, O
1765	Divinest patroness, and midwife gentle
1766	To those that cry by night, convey thy deity
1767	Aboard our dancing boat; make swift the pangs
1768	Of my queen's travails!
1769	
1770	[Enter LYCHORIDA, with an Infant]
1771	
1772	Now, Lychorida!
1773	
1774	LYCHORIDA	Here is a thing too young for such a place,
1775	Who, if it had conceit, would die, as I
1776	Am like to do: take in your arms this piece
1777	Of your dead queen.
1778	
1779	PERICLES	How, how, Lychorida!
1780	
1781	LYCHORIDA	Patience, good sir; do not assist the storm.
1782	Here's all that is left living of your queen,
1783	A little daughter: for the sake of it,
1784	Be manly, and take comfort.
1785	
1786	PERICLES	O you gods!
1787	Why do you make us love your goodly gifts,
1788	And snatch them straight away? We here below
1789	Recall not what we give, and therein may
1790	Use honour with you.
1791	
1792	LYCHORIDA	Patience, good sir,
1793	Even for this charge.
1794	
1795	PERICLES	Now, mild may be thy life!
1796	For a more blustrous birth had never babe:
1797	Quiet and gentle thy conditions! for
1798	Thou art the rudeliest welcome to this world
1799	That ever was prince's child. Happy what follows!
1800	Thou hast as chiding a nativity
1801	As fire, air, water, earth, and heaven can make,
1802	To herald thee from the womb: even at the first
1803	Thy loss is more than can thy portage quit,
1804	With all thou canst find here. Now, the good gods
1805	Throw their best eyes upon't!
1806	
1807	[Enter two Sailors]
1808	
1809	First Sailor	What courage, sir? God save you!
1810	
1811	PERICLES	Courage enough: I do not fear the flaw;
1812	It hath done to me the worst. Yet, for the love
1813	Of this poor infant, this fresh-new sea-farer,
1814	I would it would be quiet.
1815	
1816	First Sailor	Slack the bolins there! Thou wilt not, wilt thou?
1817	Blow, and split thyself.
1818	
1819	Second Sailor	But sea-room, an the brine and cloudy billow kiss
1820	the moon, I care not.
1821	
1822	First Sailor	Sir, your queen must overboard: the sea works high,
1823	the wind is loud, and will not lie till the ship be
1824	cleared of the dead.
1825	
1826	PERICLES	That's your superstition.
1827	
1828	First Sailor	Pardon us, sir; with us at sea it hath been still
1829	observed: and we are strong in custom. Therefore
1830	briefly yield her; for she must overboard straight.
1831	
1832	PERICLES	As you think meet. Most wretched queen!
1833	
1834	LYCHORIDA	Here she lies, sir.
1835	
1836	PERICLES	A terrible childbed hast thou had, my dear;
1837	No light, no fire: the unfriendly elements
1838	Forgot thee utterly: nor have I time
1839	To give thee hallow'd to thy grave, but straight
1840	Must cast thee, scarcely coffin'd, in the ooze;
1841	Where, for a monument upon thy bones,
1842	And e'er-remaining lamps, the belching whale
1843	And humming water must o'erwhelm thy corpse,
1844	Lying with simple shells. O Lychorida,
1845	Bid Nestor bring me spices, ink and paper,
1846	My casket and my jewels; and bid Nicander
1847	Bring me the satin coffer: lay the babe
1848	Upon the pillow: hie thee, whiles I say
1849	A priestly farewell to her: suddenly, woman.
1850	
1851	[Exit LYCHORIDA]
1852	
1853	Second Sailor	Sir, we have a chest beneath the hatches, caulked
1854	and bitumed ready.
1855	
1856	PERICLES	I thank thee. Mariner, say what coast is this?
1857	
1858	Second Sailor	We are near Tarsus.
1859	
1860	PERICLES	Thither, gentle mariner.
1861	Alter thy course for Tyre. When canst thou reach it?
1862	
1863	Second Sailor	By break of day, if the wind cease.
1864	
1865	PERICLES	O, make for Tarsus!
1866	There will I visit Cleon, for the babe
1867	Cannot hold out to Tyrus: there I'll leave it
1868	At careful nursing. Go thy ways, good mariner:
1869	I'll bring the body presently.

1892	
1893	PHILEMON	Doth my lord call?

1895	CERIMON	Get fire and meat for these poor men:
1896	'T has been a turbulent and stormy night.
1897	
1898	Servant	I have been in many; but such a night as this,
1899	Till now, I ne'er endured.
1900	
1901	CERIMON	Your master will be dead ere you return;
1902	There's nothing can be minister'd to nature

1904

1914	First Gentleman	Good morrow.
1915	
1916	Second Gentleman	Good morrow to your lordship.
1917	
1918	CERIMON	Gentlemen,
1919	Why do you stir so early?
1920	
1921	First Gentleman	Sir,
1922	Our lodgings, standing bleak upon the sea,
1923	Shook as the earth did quake;
1924	The very principals did seem to rend,
1925	And all-to topple: pure surprise and fear
1926	Made me to quit the house.
1927	
1928	Second Gentleman	That is the cause we trouble you so early;
1929	'Tis not our husbandry.
1930	
1931	CERIMON	O, you say well.
1932	
1933	First Gentleman	But I much marvel that your lordship, having
1934	Rich tire about you, should at these early hours
1935	Shake off the golden slumber of repose.
1936	'Tis most strange,
1937	Nature should be so conversant with pain,
1938	Being thereto not compell'd.
1939	
1940	CERIMON	I hold it ever,
1941	Virtue and cunning were endowments greater
1942	Than nobleness and riches: careless heirs
1943	May the two latter darken and expend;
1944	But immortality attends the former.
1945	Making a man a god. 'Tis known, I ever
1946	Have studied physic, through which secret art,
1947	By turning o'er authorities, I have,
1948	Together with my practise, made familiar
1949	To me and to my aid the blest infusions
1950	That dwell in vegetives, in metals, stones;
1951	And I can speak of the disturbances
1952	That nature works, and of her cures; which doth give me
1953	A more content in course of true delight
1954	Than to be thirsty after tottering honour,
1955	Or tie my treasure up in silken bags,
1956	To please the fool and death.
1957	
1958	Second Gentleman	Your honour has through Ephesus pour'd forth
1959	Your charity, and hundreds call themselves
1960	Your creatures, who by you have been restored:
1961	And not your knowledge, your personal pain, but even
1962	Your purse, still open, hath built Lord Cerimon
1963	Such strong renown as time shall ne'er decay.
1964	
1965	[Enter two or three Servants with a chest]
1966	
1967	First Servant	So; lift there.
1968	
1969	CERIMON	                  What is that?
1970	
1971	First Servant	Sir, even now
1972	Did the sea toss upon our shore this chest:
1973	'Tis of some wreck.
1974	
1975	CERIMON	Set 't down, let's look upon't.
1976	
1977	Second Gentleman	'Tis like a coffin, sir.
1978	
1979	CERIMON	Whate'er it be,
1980	'Tis wondrous heavy. Wrench it open straight:
1981	If the sea's stomach be o'ercharged with gold,
1982	'Tis a good constraint of fortune it belches upon us.
1983	
1984	Second Gentleman	'Tis so, my lord.
1985	
1986	CERIMON	                  How close 'tis caulk'd and bitumed!
1987	Did the sea cast it up?
1988	
1989	First Servant	I never saw so huge a billow, sir,
1990	As toss'd it upon shore.
1991	
1992	CERIMON	Wrench it open;
1993	Soft! it smells most sweetly in my sense.
1994	
1995	Second Gentleman	A delicate odour.
1996	
1997	CERIMON	As ever hit my nostril. So, up with it.
1998	O you most potent gods! what's here? a corse!
1999	
2000	First Gentleman	Most strange!
2001	
2002	CERIMON	Shrouded in cloth of state; balm'd and entreasured
2003	With full bags of spices! A passport too!
2004	Apollo, perfect me in the characters!
2005	
2006	[Reads from a scroll]
2007	
2008	'Here I give to understand,
2009	If e'er this coffin drive a-land,
2010	I, King Pericles, have lost
2011	This queen, worth all our mundane cost.
2012	Who finds her, give her burying;
2013	She was the daughter of a king:
2014	Besides this treasure for a fee,
2015	The gods requite his charity!'
2016	
2017	If thou livest, Pericles, thou hast a heart
2018	That even cracks for woe! This chanced tonight.

2021	
2022	CERIMON	                  Nay, certainly to-night;
2023	For look how fresh she looks! They were too rough
2024	That threw her in the sea. Make a fire within:
2025	Fetch hither all my boxes in my closet.

2028	
2029	Death may usurp on nature many hours,
2030	And yet the fire of life kindle again

2032	That had nine hours lien dead,
2033	Who was by good appliance recovered.
2034	
2035	[Re-enter a Servant, with boxes, napkins, and fire]

2037	Well said, well said; the fire and cloths.

2039	Cause it to sound, beseech you.
2040	The viol once more: how thou stirr'st, thou block!
2041	The music there!--I pray you, give her air.
2042	Gentlemen.
2043	This queen will live: nature awakes; a warmth
2044	Breathes out of her: she hath not been entranced
2045	Above five hours: see how she gins to blow
2046	Into life's flower again!
2047

2049	Through you, increase our wonder and set up

2051

2053	Her eyelids, cases to those heavenly jewels
2054	Which Pericles hath lost,
2055	Begin to part their fringes of bright gold;
2056	The diamonds of a most praised water
2057	Do appear, to make the world twice rich. Live,
2058	And make us weep to hear your fate, fair creature,
2059	Rare as you seem to be.

2118	Your grace, that fed my country with your corn,
2119	For which the people's prayers still fall upon you,
2120	Must in your child be thought on. If neglection
2121	Should therein make me vile, the common body,

2208	Now to Marina bend your mind,
2209	Whom our fast-growing scene must find
2210	At Tarsus, and by Cleon train'd
2211	In music, letters; who hath gain'd
2212	Of education all the grace,
2213	Which makes her both the heart and place
2214	Of general wonder. But, alack,
2215	That monster envy, oft the wrack
2216	Of earned praise, Marina's life
2217	Seeks to take off by treason's knife.
2218	And in this kind hath our Cleon
2219	One daughter, and a wench full grown,
2220	Even ripe for marriage-rite; this maid
2221	Hight Philoten: and it is said
2222	For certain in our story, she
2223	Would ever with Marina be:
2224	Be't when she weaved the sleided silk
2225	With fingers long, small, white as milk;
2226	Or when she would with sharp needle wound
2227	The cambric, which she made more sound
2228	By hurting it; or when to the lute
2229	She sung, and made the night-bird mute,
2230	That still records with moan; or when
2231	She would with rich and constant pen
2232	Vail to her mistress Dian; still
2233	This Philoten contends in skill
2234	With absolute Marina: so
2235	With the dove of Paphos might the crow
2236	Vie feathers white. Marina gets
2237	All praises, which are paid as debts,
2238	And not as given. This so darks
2239	In Philoten all graceful marks,
2240	That Cleon's wife, with envy rare,
2241	A present murderer does prepare
2242	For good Marina, that her daughter
2243	Might stand peerless by this slaughter.
2244	The sooner her vile thoughts to stead,
2245	Lychorida, our nurse, is dead:
2246	And cursed Dionyza hath
2247	The pregnant instrument of wrath
2248	Prest for this blow. The unborn event
2249	I do commend to your content:
2250	Only I carry winged time
2251	Post on the lame feet of my rhyme;
2252	Which never could I so convey,
2253	Unless your thoughts went on my way.
2254	Dionyza does appear,
2255	With Leonine, a murderer.

2269	SCENE I	Tarsus. An open place near the sea-shore.
2270	
2271	
2272	[Enter DIONYZA and LEONINE]
2273	
2274	DIONYZA	Thy oath remember; thou hast sworn to do't:
2275	'Tis but a blow, which never shall be known.
2276	Thou canst not do a thing in the world so soon,
2277	To yield thee so much profit. Let not conscience,
2278	Which is but cold, inflaming love i' thy bosom,
2279	Inflame too nicely; nor let pity, which
2280	Even women have cast off, melt thee, but be
2281	A soldier to thy purpose.
2282	
2283	LEONINE	I will do't; but yet she is a goodly creature.
2284	
2285	DIONYZA	The fitter, then, the gods should have her. Here
2286	she comes weeping for her only mistress' death.
2287	Thou art resolved?
2288	
2289	LEONINE	I am resolved.
2290	
2291	[Enter MARINA, with a basket of flowers]
2292	
2293	MARINA	No, I will rob Tellus of her weed,
2294	To strew thy green with flowers: the yellows, blues,
2295	The purple violets, and marigolds,
2296	Shall as a carpet hang upon thy grave,
2297	While summer-days do last. Ay me! poor maid,
2298	Born in a tempest, when my mother died,
2299	This world to me is like a lasting storm,
2300	Whirring me from my friends.
2301	
2302	DIONYZA	How now, Marina! why do you keep alone?
2303	How chance my daughter is not with you? Do not
2304	Consume your blood with sorrowing: you have
2305	A nurse of me. Lord, how your favour's changed
2306	With this unprofitable woe!
2307	Come, give me your flowers, ere the sea mar it.
2308	Walk with Leonine; the air is quick there,
2309	And it pierces and sharpens the stomach. Come,
2310	Leonine, take her by the arm, walk with her.
2311	
2312	MARINA	No, I pray you;
2313	I'll not bereave you of your servant.
2314	
2315	DIONYZA	Come, come;
2316	I love the king your father, and yourself,
2317	With more than foreign heart. We every day
2318	Expect him here: when he shall come and find
2319	Our paragon to all reports thus blasted,
2320	He will repent the breadth of his great voyage;
2321	Blame both my lord and me, that we have taken
2322	No care to your best courses. Go, I pray you,
2323	Walk, and be cheerful once again; reserve
2324	That excellent complexion, which did steal
2325	The eyes of young and old. Care not for me
2326	I can go home alone.
2327	
2328	MARINA	Well, I will go;
2329	But yet I have no desire to it.
2330	
2331	DIONYZA	Come, come, I know 'tis good for you.
2332	Walk half an hour, Leonine, at the least:
2333	Remember what I have said.
2334	
2335	LEONINE	I warrant you, madam.
2336	
2337	DIONYZA	I'll leave you, my sweet lady, for a while:
2338	Pray, walk softly, do not heat your blood:
2339	What! I must have a care of you.
2340	
2341	MARINA	My thanks, sweet madam.
2342	
2343	[Exit DIONYZA]
2344	
2345	Is this wind westerly that blows?
2346	
2347	LEONINE	South-west.
2348	
2349	MARINA	When I was born, the wind was north.
2350	
2351	LEONINE	Was't so?
2352	
2353	MARINA	My father, as nurse said, did never fear,
2354	But cried 'Good seaman!' to the sailors, galling
2355	His kingly hands, haling ropes;
2356	And, clasping to the mast, endured a sea
2357	That almost burst the deck.
2358	
2359	LEONINE	When was this?
2360	
2361	MARINA	When I was born:
2362	Never was waves nor wind more violent;
2363	And from the ladder-tackle washes off
2364	A canvas-climber. 'Ha!' says one, 'wilt out?'
2365	And with a dropping industry they skip
2366	From stem to stern: the boatswain whistles, and
2367	The master calls, and trebles their confusion.
2368	
2369	LEONINE	Come, say your prayers.
2370	
2371	MARINA	What mean you?
2372	
2373	LEONINE	If you require a little space for prayer,
2374	I grant it: pray; but be not tedious,
2375	For the gods are quick of ear, and I am sworn
2376	To do my work with haste.
2377	
2378	MARINA	Why will you kill me?
2379	
2380	LEONINE	To satisfy my lady.
2381	
2382	MARINA	Why would she have me kill'd?
2383	Now, as I can remember, by my troth,
2384	I never did her hurt in all my life:
2385	I never spake bad word, nor did ill turn
2386	To any living creature: believe me, la,
2387	I never kill'd a mouse, nor hurt a fly:
2388	I trod upon a worm against my will,
2389	But I wept for it. How have I offended,
2390	Wherein my death might yield her any profit,
2391	Or my life imply her any danger?
2392	
2393	LEONINE	My commission
2394	Is not to reason of the deed, but do it.
2395	
2396	MARINA	You will not do't for all the world, I hope.
2397	You are well favour'd, and your looks foreshow
2398	You have a gentle heart. I saw you lately,
2399	When you caught hurt in parting two that fought:
2400	Good sooth, it show'd well in you: do so now:
2401	Your lady seeks my life; come you between,
2402	And save poor me, the weaker.
2403	
2404	LEONINE	I am sworn,
2405	And will dispatch.
2406	
2407	[He seizes her]
2408	
2409	[Enter Pirates]
2410	
2411	First Pirate	Hold, villain!
2412	
2413	[LEONINE runs away]
2414	
2415	Second Pirate	A prize! a prize!
2416	
2417	Third Pirate	Half-part, mates, half-part.
2418	Come, let's have her aboard suddenly.
2419	
2420	[Exeunt Pirates with MARINA]
2421	
2422	[Re-enter LEONINE]
2423	
2424	LEONINE	These roguing thieves serve the great pirate Valdes;
2425	And they have seized Marina. Let her go:
2426	There's no hope she will return. I'll swear
2427	she's dead,
2428	And thrown into the sea. But I'll see further:
2429	Perhaps they will but please themselves upon her,
2430	Not carry her aboard. If she remain,
2431	Whom they have ravish'd must by me be slain.

2444	
2445	SCENE II	Mytilene. A room in a brothel.
2446	
2447	
2448	[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT]
2449	
2450	Pandar	Boult!
2451	
2452	BOULT	Sir?
2453	
2454	Pandar	Search the market narrowly; Mytilene is full of
2455	gallants. We lost too much money this mart by being
2456	too wenchless.
2457	
2458	Bawd	We were never so much out of creatures. We have but
2459	poor three, and they can do no more than they can
2460	do; and they with continual action are even as good as rotten.
2461	
2462	Pandar	Therefore let's have fresh ones, whate'er we pay for
2463	them. If there be not a conscience to be used in
2464	every trade, we shall never prosper.
2465	
2466	Bawd	Thou sayest true: 'tis not our bringing up of poor
2467	bastards,--as, I think, I have brought up some eleven--
2468	
2469	BOULT	Ay, to eleven; and brought them down again. But
2470	shall I search the market?
2471	
2472	Bawd	What else, man? The stuff we have, a strong wind
2473	will blow it to pieces, they are so pitifully sodden.
2474	
2475	Pandar	Thou sayest true; they're too unwholesome, o'
2476	conscience. The poor Transylvanian is dead, that
2477	lay with the little baggage.
2478	
2479	BOULT	Ay, she quickly pooped him; she made him roast-meat
2480	for worms. But I'll go search the market.
2481	
2482	[Exit]
2483	
2484	Pandar	Three or four thousand chequins were as pretty a
2485	proportion to live quietly, and so give over.
2486	
2487	Bawd	Why to give over, I pray you? is it a shame to get
2488	when we are old?
2489	
2490	Pandar	O, our credit comes not in like the commodity, nor
2491	the commodity wages not with the danger: therefore,
2492	if in our youths we could pick up some pretty
2493	estate, 'twere not amiss to keep our door hatched.
2494	Besides, the sore terms we stand upon with the gods
2495	will be strong with us for giving over.
2496	
2497	Bawd	Come, other sorts offend as well as we.
2498	
2499	Pandar	As well as we! ay, and better too; we offend worse.
2500	Neither is our profession any trade; it's no
2501	calling. But here comes Boult.
2502	
2503	[Re-enter BOULT, with the Pirates and MARINA]
2504	
2505	BOULT	[To MARINA]  Come your ways. My masters, you say
2506	she's a virgin?
2507	
2508	First Pirate	O, sir, we doubt it not.
2509	
2510	BOULT	Master, I have gone through for this piece, you see:
2511	if you like her, so; if not, I have lost my earnest.
2512	
2513	Bawd	Boult, has she any qualities?
2514	
2515	BOULT	She has a good face, speaks well, and has excellent
2516	good clothes: there's no further necessity of
2517	qualities can make her be refused.
2518	
2519	Bawd	What's her price, Boult?
2520	
2521	BOULT	I cannot be bated one doit of a thousand pieces.
2522	
2523	Pandar	Well, follow me, my masters, you shall have your
2524	money presently. Wife, take her in; instruct her
2525	what she has to do, that she may not be raw in her
2526	entertainment.
2527	
2528	[Exeunt Pandar and Pirates]
2529	
2530	Bawd	Boult, take you the marks of her, the colour of her
2531	hair, complexion, height, age, with warrant of her
2532	virginity; and cry 'He that will give most shall
2533	have her first.' Such a maidenhead were no cheap
2534	thing, if men were as they have been. Get this done
2535	as I command you.
2536	
2537	BOULT	Performance shall follow.
2538	
2539	[Exit]
2540	
2541	MARINA	Alack that Leonine was so slack, so slow!
2542	He should have struck, not spoke; or that these pirates,
2543	Not enough barbarous, had not o'erboard thrown me
2544	For to seek my mother!
2545	
2546	Bawd	Why lament you, pretty one?
2547	
2548	MARINA	That I am pretty.
2549	
2550	Bawd	Come, the gods have done their part in you.
2551	
2552	MARINA	I accuse them not.
2553	
2554	Bawd	You are light into my hands, where you are like to live.
2555	
2556	MARINA	The more my fault
2557	To scape his hands where I was like to die.
2558	
2559	Bawd	Ay, and you shall live in pleasure.
2560	
2561	MARINA	No.
2562	
2563	Bawd	Yes, indeed shall you, and taste gentlemen of all
2564	fashions: you shall fare well; you shall have the
2565	difference of all complexions. What! do you stop your ears?
2566	
2567	MARINA	Are you a woman?
2568	
2569	Bawd	What would you have me be, an I be not a woman?
2570	
2571	MARINA	An honest woman, or not a woman.
2572	
2573	Bawd	Marry, whip thee, gosling: I think I shall have
2574	something to do with you. Come, you're a young
2575	foolish sapling, and must be bowed as I would have
2576	you.
2577	
2578	MARINA	The gods defend me!
2579	
2580	Bawd	If it please the gods to defend you by men, then men
2581	must comfort you, men must feed you, men must stir
2582	you up. Boult's returned.
2583	
2584	[Re-enter BOULT]
2585	
2586	Now, sir, hast thou cried her through the market?
2587	
2588	BOULT	I have cried her almost to the number of her hairs;
2589	I have drawn her picture with my voice.
2590	
2591	Bawd	And I prithee tell me, how dost thou find the
2592	inclination of the people, especially of the younger sort?
2593	
2594	BOULT	'Faith, they listened to me as they would have
2595	hearkened to their father's testament. There was a
2596	Spaniard's mouth so watered, that he went to bed to
2597	her very description.
2598	
2599	Bawd	We shall have him here to-morrow with his best ruff on.
2600	
2601	BOULT	To-night, to-night. But, mistress, do you know the
2602	French knight that cowers i' the hams?
2603	
2604	Bawd	Who, Monsieur Veroles?
2605	
2606	BOULT	Ay, he: he offered to cut a caper at the
2607	proclamation; but he made a groan at it, and swore
2608	he would see her to-morrow.
2609	
2610	Bawd	Well, well; as for him, he brought his disease
2611	hither: here he does but repair it. I know he will
2612	come in our shadow, to scatter his crowns in the
2613	sun.
2614	
2615	BOULT	Well, if we had of every nation a traveller, we
2616	should lodge them with this sign.
2617	
2618	Bawd	[To MARINA]  Pray you, come hither awhile. You
2619	have fortunes coming upon you. Mark me: you must
2620	seem to do that fearfully which you commit
2621	willingly, despise profit where you have most gain.
2622	To weep that you live as ye do makes pity in your
2623	lovers: seldom but that pity begets you a good
2624	opinion, and that opinion a mere profit.
2625	
2626	MARINA	I understand you not.
2627	
2628	BOULT	O, take her home, mistress, take her home: these
2629	blushes of hers must be quenched with some present practise.
2630	
2631	Bawd	Thou sayest true, i' faith, so they must; for your
2632	bride goes to that with shame which is her way to go
2633	with warrant.
2634	
2635	BOULT	'Faith, some do, and some do not. But, mistress, if
2636	I have bargained for the joint,--
2637	
2638	Bawd	Thou mayst cut a morsel off the spit.
2639	
2640	BOULT	I may so.
2641	
2642	Bawd	Who should deny it? Come, young one, I like the
2643	manner of your garments well.
2644	
2645	BOULT	Ay, by my faith, they shall not be changed yet.
2646	
2647	Bawd	Boult, spend thou that in the town: report what a
2648	sojourner we have; you'll lose nothing by custom.
2649	When nature flamed this piece, she meant thee a good
2650	turn; therefore say what a paragon she is, and thou
2651	hast the harvest out of thine own report.
2652	
2653	BOULT	I warrant you, mistress, thunder shall not so awake
2654	the beds of eels as my giving out her beauty stir up
2655	the lewdly-inclined. I'll bring home some to-night.
2656	
2657	Bawd	Come your ways; follow me.
2658	
2659	MARINA	If fires be hot, knives sharp, or waters deep,
2660	Untied I still my virgin knot will keep.
2661	Diana, aid my purpose!
2662	
2663	Bawd	What have we to do with Diana? Pray you, will you go with us?

2678

2680	[Enter CLEON and DIONYZA]
2681	
2682	DIONYZA	Why, are you foolish? Can it be undone?
2683	
2684	CLEON	O Dionyza, such a piece of slaughter
2685	The sun and moon ne'er look'd upon!
2686	
2687	DIONYZA	I think
2688	You'll turn a child again.
2689	
2690	CLEON	Were I chief lord of all this spacious world,
2691	I'ld give it to undo the deed. O lady,
2692	Much less in blood than virtue, yet a princess
2693	To equal any single crown o' the earth
2694	I' the justice of compare! O villain Leonine!
2695	Whom thou hast poison'd too:
2696	If thou hadst drunk to him, 't had been a kindness
2697	Becoming well thy fact: what canst thou say
2698	When noble Pericles shall demand his child?
2699	
2700	DIONYZA	That she is dead. Nurses are not the fates,
2701	To foster it, nor ever to preserve.
2702	She died at night; I'll say so. Who can cross it?
2703	Unless you play the pious innocent,
2704	And for an honest attribute cry out
2705	'She died by foul play.'
2706	
2707	CLEON	O, go to. Well, well,
2708	Of all the faults beneath the heavens, the gods
2709	Do like this worst.
2710	
2711	DIONYZA	Be one of those that think
2712	The petty wrens of Tarsus will fly hence,
2713	And open this to Pericles. I do shame
2714	To think of what a noble strain you are,
2715	And of how coward a spirit.
2716	
2717	CLEON	To such proceeding
2718	Who ever but his approbation added,
2719	Though not his prime consent, he did not flow
2720	From honourable sources.
2721	
2722	DIONYZA	Be it so, then:
2723	Yet none does know, but you, how she came dead,
2724	Nor none can know, Leonine being gone.
2725	She did disdain my child, and stood between
2726	Her and her fortunes: none would look on her,
2727	But cast their gazes on Marina's face;
2728	Whilst ours was blurted at and held a malkin
2729	Not worth the time of day. It pierced me through;
2730	And though you call my course unnatural,
2731	You not your child well loving, yet I find
2732	It greets me as an enterprise of kindness
2733	Perform'd to your sole daughter.
2734	
2735	CLEON	Heavens forgive it!
2736	
2737	DIONYZA	And as for Pericles,
2738	What should he say? We wept after her hearse,
2739	And yet we mourn: her monument
2740	Is almost finish'd, and her epitaphs
2741	In glittering golden characters express
2742	A general praise to her, and care in us
2743	At whose expense 'tis done.
2744	
2745	CLEON	Thou art like the harpy,
2746	Which, to betray, dost, with thine angel's face,

2765	SCENE IV:
2766	
2767	
2768	[Enter GOWER, before the monument of MARINA at Tarsus]
2769	
2770	GOWER	Thus time we waste, and longest leagues make short;
2771	Sail seas in cockles, have an wish but for't;
2772	Making, to take your imagination,
2773	From bourn to bourn, region to region.
2774	By you being pardon'd, we commit no crime
2775	To use one language in each several clime
2776	Where our scenes seem to live. I do beseech you
2777	To learn of me, who stand i' the gaps to teach you,
2778	The stages of our story. Pericles
2779	Is now again thwarting the wayward seas,
2780	Attended on by many a lord and knight.
2781	To see his daughter, all his life's delight.
2782	Old Escanes, whom Helicanus late
2783	Advanced in time to great and high estate,
2784	Is left to govern. Bear you it in mind,
2785	Old Helicanus goes along behind.
2786	Well-sailing ships and bounteous winds have brought
2787	This king to Tarsus,--think his pilot thought;
2788	So with his steerage shall your thoughts grow on,--
2789	To fetch his daughter home, who first is gone.
2790	Like motes and shadows see them move awhile;
2791	Your ears unto your eyes I'll reconcile.
2792	
2793	DUMB SHOW.
2794	
2795	[Enter PERICLES, at one door, with all his train;
2796	CLEON and DIONYZA, at the other. CLEON shows
2797	PERICLES the tomb; whereat PERICLES makes
2798	lamentation, puts on sackcloth, and in a mighty
2799	passion departs. Then exeunt CLEON and DIONYZA]
2800	
2801	See how belief may suffer by foul show!
2802	This borrow'd passion stands for true old woe;
2803	And Pericles, in sorrow all devour'd,
2804	With sighs shot through, and biggest tears
2805	o'ershower'd,
2806	Leaves Tarsus and again embarks. He swears
2807	Never to wash his face, nor cut his hairs:
2808	He puts on sackcloth, and to sea. He bears
2809	A tempest, which his mortal vessel tears,
2810	And yet he rides it out. Now please you wit.
2811	The epitaph is for Marina writ
2812	By wicked Dionyza.
2813	
2814	[Reads the inscription on MARINA's monument]
2815	
2816	'The fairest, sweet'st, and best lies here,
2817	Who wither'd in her spring of year.
2818	She was of Tyrus the king's daughter,
2819	On whom foul death hath made this slaughter;
2820	Marina was she call'd; and at her birth,
2821	Thetis, being proud, swallow'd some part o' the earth:
2822	Therefore the earth, fearing to be o'erflow'd,
2823	Hath Thetis' birth-child on the heavens bestow'd:
2824	Wherefore she does, and swears she'll never stint,
2825	Make raging battery upon shores of flint.'
2826	
2827	No visor does become black villany
2828	So well as soft and tender flattery.
2829	Let Pericles believe his daughter's dead,
2830	And bear his courses to be ordered
2831	By Lady Fortune; while our scene must play
2832	His daughter's woe and heavy well-a-day
2833	In her unholy service. Patience, then,
2834	And think you now are all in Mytilene.

2856	being once gone.
2857	
2858	First Gentleman	But to have divinity preached there! did you ever
2859	dream of such a thing?
2860	
2861	Second Gentleman	No, no. Come, I am for no more bawdy-houses:
2862	shall's go hear the vestals sing?

2880	
2881	
2882	[Enter Pandar, Bawd, and BOULT]
2883	
2884	Pandar	Well, I had rather than twice the worth of her she
2885	had ne'er come here.
2886	
2887	Bawd	Fie, fie upon her! she's able to freeze the god
2888	Priapus, and undo a whole generation. We must
2889	either get her ravished, or be rid of her. When she
2890	should do for clients her fitment, and do me the
2891	kindness of our profession, she has me her quirks,
2892	her reasons, her master reasons, her prayers, her
2893	knees; that she would make a puritan of the devil,
2894	if he should cheapen a kiss of her.
2895	
2896	BOULT	'Faith, I must ravish her, or she'll disfurnish us
2897	of all our cavaliers, and make our swearers priests.
2898	
2899	Pandar	Now, the pox upon her green-sickness for me!
2900	
2901	Bawd	'Faith, there's no way to be rid on't but by the
2902	way to the pox. Here comes the Lord Lysimachus disguised.
2903	
2904	BOULT	We should have both lord and lown, if the peevish
2905	baggage would but give way to customers.
2906	
2907	[Enter LYSIMACHUS]
2908	
2909	LYSIMACHUS	How now! How a dozen of virginities?
2910	
2911	Bawd	Now, the gods to-bless your honour!
2912	
2913	BOULT	I am glad to see your honour in good health.
2914	
2915	LYSIMACHUS	You may so; 'tis the better for you that your
2916	resorters stand upon sound legs. How now!
2917	wholesome iniquity have you that a man may deal
2918	withal, and defy the surgeon?
2919	
2920	Bawd	We have here one, sir, if she would--but there never
2921	came her like in Mytilene.
2922	
2923	LYSIMACHUS	If she'ld do the deed of darkness, thou wouldst say.
2924	
2925	Bawd	Your honour knows what 'tis to say well enough.
2926	
2927	LYSIMACHUS	Well, call forth, call forth.
2928	
2929	BOULT	For flesh and blood, sir, white and red, you shall
2930	see a rose; and she were a rose indeed, if she had but--
2931	
2932	LYSIMACHUS	What, prithee?
2933	
2934	BOULT	O, sir, I can be modest.
2935	
2936	LYSIMACHUS	That dignifies the renown of a bawd, no less than it
2937	gives a good report to a number to be chaste.
2938	
2939	[Exit BOULT]
2940	
2941	Bawd	Here comes that which grows to the stalk; never
2942	plucked yet, I can assure you.
2943	
2944	[Re-enter BOULT with MARINA]
2945	
2946	Is she not a fair creature?
2947	
2948	LYSIMACHUS	'Faith, she would serve after a long voyage at sea.
2949	Well, there's for you: leave us.
2950	
2951	Bawd	I beseech your honour, give me leave: a word, and
2952	I'll have done presently.
2953	
2954	LYSIMACHUS	I beseech you, do.
2955	
2956	Bawd	[To MARINA]  First, I would have you note, this is
2957	an honourable man.
2958	
2959	MARINA	I desire to find him so, that I may worthily note him.
2960	
2961	Bawd	Next, he's the governor of this country, and a man
2962	whom I am bound to.
2963	
2964	MARINA	If he govern the country, you are bound to him
2965	indeed; but how honourable he is in that, I know not.
2966	
2967	Bawd	Pray you, without any more virginal fencing, will
2968	you use him kindly? He will line your apron with gold.
2969	
2970	MARINA	What he will do graciously, I will thankfully receive.
2971	
2972	LYSIMACHUS	Ha' you done?
2973	
2974	Bawd	My lord, she's not paced yet: you must take some
2975	pains to work her to your manage. Come, we will
2976	leave his honour and her together. Go thy ways.
2977	
2978	[Exeunt Bawd, Pandar, and BOULT]
2979	
2980	LYSIMACHUS	Now, pretty one, how long have you been at this trade?
2981	
2982	MARINA	What trade, sir?
2983	
2984	LYSIMACHUS	Why, I cannot name't but I shall offend.
2985	
2986	MARINA	I cannot be offended with my trade. Please you to name it.
2987	
2988	LYSIMACHUS	How long have you been of this profession?
2989	
2990	MARINA	E'er since I can remember.
2991	
2992	LYSIMACHUS	Did you go to 't so young? Were you a gamester at
2993	five or at seven?
2994	
2995	MARINA	Earlier too, sir, if now I be one.
2996	
2997	LYSIMACHUS	Why, the house you dwell in proclaims you to be a
2998	creature of sale.
2999	
3000	MARINA	Do you know this house to be a place of such resort,
3001	and will come into 't? I hear say you are of
3002	honourable parts, and are the governor of this place.
3003	
3004	LYSIMACHUS	Why, hath your principal made known unto you who I am?
3005	
3006	MARINA	Who is my principal?
3007	
3008	LYSIMACHUS	Why, your herb-woman; she that sets seeds and roots
3009	of shame and iniquity. O, you have heard something
3010	of my power, and so stand aloof for more serious
3011	wooing. But I protest to thee, pretty one, my
3012	authority shall not see thee, or else look friendly
3013	upon thee. Come, bring me to some private place:
3014	come, come.
3015	
3016	MARINA	If you were born to honour, show it now;
3017	If put upon you, make the judgment good
3018	That thought you worthy of it.
3019	
3020	LYSIMACHUS	How's this? how's this? Some more; be sage.
3021	
3022	MARINA	For me,
3023	That am a maid, though most ungentle fortune
3024	Have placed me in this sty, where, since I came,
3025	Diseases have been sold dearer than physic,
3026	O, that the gods
3027	Would set me free from this unhallow'd place,
3028	Though they did change me to the meanest bird
3029	That flies i' the purer air!
3030	
3031	LYSIMACHUS	I did not think
3032	Thou couldst have spoke so well; ne'er dream'd thou couldst.
3033	Had I brought hither a corrupted mind,
3034	Thy speech had alter'd it. Hold, here's gold for thee:
3035	Persever in that clear way thou goest,
3036	And the gods strengthen thee!
3037	
3038	MARINA	The good gods preserve you!
3039	
3040	LYSIMACHUS	For me, be you thoughten
3041	That I came with no ill intent; for to me
3042	The very doors and windows savour vilely.
3043	Fare thee well. Thou art a piece of virtue, and
3044	I doubt not but thy training hath been noble.
3045	Hold, here's more gold for thee.
3046	A curse upon him, die he like a thief,
3047	That robs thee of thy goodness! If thou dost
3048	Hear from me, it shall be for thy good.
3049	
3050	[Re-enter BOULT]
3051	
3052	BOULT	I beseech your honour, one piece for me.
3053	
3054	LYSIMACHUS	Avaunt, thou damned door-keeper!
3055	Your house, but for this virgin that doth prop it,
3056	Would sink and overwhelm you. Away!
3057	
3058	[Exit]
3059	
3060	BOULT	How's this? We must take another course with you.
3061	If your peevish chastity, which is not worth a
3062	breakfast in the cheapest country under the cope,
3063	shall undo a whole household, let me be gelded like
3064	a spaniel. Come your ways.
3065	
3066	MARINA	 Whither would you have me?
3067	
3068	BOULT	I must have your maidenhead taken off, or the common
3069	hangman shall execute it. Come your ways. We'll
3070	have no more gentlemen driven away. Come your ways, I say.
3071	
3072	[Re-enter Bawd]
3073	
3074	Bawd	How now! what's the matter?
3075	
3076	BOULT	Worse and worse, mistress; she has here spoken holy
3077	words to the Lord Lysimachus.
3078	
3079	Bawd	O abominable!
3080	
3081	BOULT	She makes our profession as it were to stink afore
3082	the face of the gods.
3083	
3084	Bawd	Marry, hang her up for ever!
3085	
3086	BOULT	The nobleman would have dealt with her like a
3087	nobleman, and she sent him away as cold as a
3088	snowball; saying his prayers too.
3089	
3090	Bawd	Boult, take her away; use her at thy pleasure:
3091	crack the glass of her virginity, and make the rest malleable.
3092	
3093	BOULT	An if she were a thornier piece of ground than she
3094	is, she shall be ploughed.
3095	
3096	MARINA	Hark, hark, you gods!
3097	
3098	Bawd	She conjures: away with her! Would she had never
3099	come within my doors! Marry, hang you! She's born
3100	to undo us. Will you not go the way of women-kind?
3101	Marry, come up, my dish of chastity with rosemary and bays!
3102	
3103	[Exit]
3104	
3105	BOULT	Come, mistress; come your ways with me.
3106	
3107	MARINA	Whither wilt thou have me?
3108	
3109	BOULT	To take from you the jewel you hold so dear.
3110	
3111	MARINA	Prithee, tell me one thing first.
3112	
3113	BOULT	Come now, your one thing.
3114	
3115	MARINA	What canst thou wish thine enemy to be?
3116	
3117	BOULT	Why, I could wish him to be my master, or rather, my mistress.
3118	
3119	MARINA	Neither of these are so bad as thou art,
3120	Since they do better thee in their command.
3121	Thou hold'st a place, for which the pained'st fiend
3122	Of hell would not in reputation change:
3123	Thou art the damned doorkeeper to every
3124	Coistrel that comes inquiring for his Tib;
3125	To the choleric fisting of every rogue
3126	Thy ear is liable; thy food is such
3127	As hath been belch'd on by infected lungs.
3128	
3129	BOULT	What would you have me do? go to the wars, would
3130	you? where a man may serve seven years for the loss
3131	of a leg, and have not money enough in the end to
3132	buy him a wooden one?
3133	
3134	MARINA	Do any thing but this thou doest. Empty
3135	OLD receptacles, or common shores, of filth;
3136	Serve by indenture to the common hangman:
3137	Any of these ways are yet better than this;
3138	For what thou professest, a baboon, could he speak,
3139	Would own a name too dear. O, that the gods
3140	Would safely deliver me from this place!
3141	Here, here's gold for thee.
3142	If that thy master would gain by thee,
3143	Proclaim that I can sing, weave, sew, and dance,
3144	With other virtues, which I'll keep from boast:
3145	And I will undertake all these to teach.
3146	I doubt not but this populous city will
3147	Yield many scholars.
3148	
3149	BOULT	But can you teach all this you speak of?
3150	
3151	MARINA	Prove that I cannot, take me home again,
3152	And prostitute me to the basest groom
3153	That doth frequent your house.
3154	
3155	BOULT	Well, I will see what I can do for thee: if I can
3156	place thee, I will.
3157	
3158	MARINA	But amongst honest women.
3159	
3160	BOULT	'Faith, my acquaintance lies little amongst them.
3161	But since my master and mistress have bought you,
3162	there's no going but by their consent: therefore I
3163	will make them acquainted with your purpose, and I
3164	doubt not but I shall find them tractable enough.
3165	Come, I'll do for thee what I can; come your ways.

3182	She sings like one immortal, and she dances
3183	As goddess-like to her admired lays;
3184	Deep clerks she dumbs; and with her needle composes
3185	Nature's own shape, of bud, bird, branch, or berry,
3186	That even her art sisters the natural roses;
3187	Her inkle, silk, twin with the rubied cherry:
3188	That pupils lacks she none of noble race,

3192	Where we left him, on the sea. We there him lost;

3266	LYSIMACHUS	I am the governor of this place you lie before.
3267	
3268	HELICANUS	Sir,
3269	Our vessel is of Tyre, in it the king;
3270	A man who for this three months hath not spoken
3271	To any one, nor taken sustenance
3272	But to prorogue his grief.
3273	
3274	LYSIMACHUS	Upon what ground is his distemperature?
3275	
3276	HELICANUS	'Twould be too tedious to repeat;
3277	But the main grief springs from the loss
3278	Of a beloved daughter and a wife.
3279	
3280	LYSIMACHUS	May we not see him?
3281	
3282	HELICANUS	You may;
3283	But bootless is your sight: he will not speak To any.
3284	
3285	LYSIMACHUS	Yet let me obtain my wish.
3286	
3287	HELICANUS	Behold him.
3288	
3289	[PERICLES discovered]
3290	
3291	This was a goodly person,
3292	Till the disaster that, one mortal night,
3293	Drove him to this.
3294	
3295	LYSIMACHUS	Sir king, all hail! the gods preserve you!
3296	Hail, royal sir!
3297	
3298	HELICANUS	It is in vain; he will not speak to you.
3299	
3300	First Lord	Sir,
3301	We have a maid in Mytilene, I durst wager,
3302	Would win some words of him.
3303	
3304	LYSIMACHUS	'Tis well bethought.
3305	She questionless with her sweet harmony
3306	And other chosen attractions, would allure,
3307	And make a battery through his deafen'd parts,
3308	Which now are midway stopp'd:
3309	She is all happy as the fairest of all,
3310	And, with her fellow maids is now upon
3311	The leafy shelter that abuts against
3312	The island's side.
3313	
3314	[Whispers a Lord, who goes off in the barge of
3315	LYSIMACHUS]
3316	
3317	HELICANUS	Sure, all's effectless; yet nothing we'll omit
3318	That bears recovery's name. But, since your kindness
3319	We have stretch'd thus far, let us beseech you
3320	That for our gold we may provision have,
3321	Wherein we are not destitute for want,
3322	But weary for the staleness.
3323	
3324	LYSIMACHUS	O, sir, a courtesy
3325	Which if we should deny, the most just gods
3326	For every graff would send a caterpillar,
3327	And so afflict our province. Yet once more
3328	Let me entreat to know at large the cause
3329	Of your king's sorrow.
3330	
3331	HELICANUS	Sit, sir, I will recount it to you:
3332	But, see, I am prevented.
3333	
3334	[Re-enter, from the barge, Lord, with MARINA, and a
3335	young Lady]
3336	
3337	LYSIMACHUS	O, here is
3338	The lady that I sent for. Welcome, fair one!
3339	Is't not a goodly presence?
3340	
3341	HELICANUS	She's a gallant lady.
3342	
3343	LYSIMACHUS	She's such a one, that, were I well assured
3344	Came of a gentle kind and noble stock,
3345	I'ld wish no better choice, and think me rarely wed.
3346	Fair one, all goodness that consists in bounty
3347	Expect even here, where is a kingly patient:
3348	If that thy prosperous and artificial feat
3349	Can draw him but to answer thee in aught,
3350	Thy sacred physic shall receive such pay
3351	As thy desires can wish.
3352	
3353	MARINA	Sir, I will use
3354	My utmost skill in his recovery, Provided
3355	That none but I and my companion maid
3356	Be suffer'd to come near him.
3357	
3358	LYSIMACHUS	Come, let us leave her;
3359	And the gods make her prosperous!
3360	
3361	[MARINA sings]
3362	
3363	LYSIMACHUS	Mark'd he your music?
3364	
3365	MARINA	No, nor look'd on us.
3366	
3367	LYSIMACHUS	See, she will speak to him.
3368	
3369	MARINA	Hail, sir! my lord, lend ear.
3370	
3371	PERICLES	Hum, ha!
3372	
3373	MARINA	I am a maid,
3374	My lord, that ne'er before invited eyes,
3375	But have been gazed on like a comet: she speaks,
3376	My lord, that, may be, hath endured a grief
3377	Might equal yours, if both were justly weigh'd.
3378	Though wayward fortune did malign my state,
3379	My derivation was from ancestors
3380	Who stood equivalent with mighty kings:
3381	But time hath rooted out my parentage,
3382	And to the world and awkward casualties
3383	Bound me in servitude.
3384	
3385	[Aside]
3386	
3387	I will desist;
3388	But there is something glows upon my cheek,
3389	And whispers in mine ear, 'Go not till he speak.'
3390	
3391	PERICLES	My fortunes--parentage--good parentage--
3392	To equal mine!--was it not thus? what say you?
3393	
3394	MARINA	I said, my lord, if you did know my parentage,
3395	You would not do me violence.
3396	
3397	PERICLES	I do think so. Pray you, turn your eyes upon me.
3398	You are like something that--What country-woman?
3399	Here of these shores?
3400	
3401	MARINA	No, nor of any shores:
3402	Yet I was mortally brought forth, and am
3403	No other than I appear.
3404	
3405	PERICLES	I am great with woe, and shall deliver weeping.
3406	My dearest wife was like this maid, and such a one
3407	My daughter might have been: my queen's square brows;
3408	Her stature to an inch; as wand-like straight;
3409	As silver-voiced; her eyes as jewel-like
3410	And cased as richly; in pace another Juno;
3411	Who starves the ears she feeds, and makes them hungry,
3412	The more she gives them speech. Where do you live?
3413	
3414	MARINA	Where I am but a stranger: from the deck
3415	You may discern the place.
3416	
3417	PERICLES	Where were you bred?
3418	And how achieved you these endowments, which
3419	You make more rich to owe?
3420	
3421	MARINA	If I should tell my history, it would seem
3422	Like lies disdain'd in the reporting.
3423	
3424	PERICLES	Prithee, speak:
3425	Falseness cannot come from thee; for thou look'st
3426	Modest as Justice, and thou seem'st a palace
3427	For the crown'd Truth to dwell in: I will
3428	believe thee,
3429	And make my senses credit thy relation
3430	To points that seem impossible; for thou look'st
3431	Like one I loved indeed. What were thy friends?
3432	Didst thou not say, when I did push thee back--
3433	Which was when I perceived thee--that thou camest
3434	From good descending?
3435	
3436	MARINA	So indeed I did.
3437	
3438	PERICLES	Report thy parentage. I think thou said'st
3439	Thou hadst been toss'd from wrong to injury,
3440	And that thou thought'st thy griefs might equal mine,
3441	If both were open'd.
3442	
3443	MARINA	Some such thing
3444	I said, and said no more but what my thoughts
3445	Did warrant me was likely.
3446	
3447	PERICLES	Tell thy story;
3448	If thine consider'd prove the thousandth part
3449	Of my endurance, thou art a man, and I
3450	Have suffer'd like a girl: yet thou dost look
3451	Like Patience gazing on kings' graves, and smiling
3452	Extremity out of act. What were thy friends?
3453	How lost thou them? Thy name, my most kind virgin?
3454	Recount, I do beseech thee: come, sit by me.
3455	
3456	MARINA	My name is Marina.
3457	
3458	PERICLES	                  O, I am mock'd,
3459	And thou by some incensed god sent hither
3460	To make the world to laugh at me.
3461	
3462	MARINA	Patience, good sir,
3463	Or here I'll cease.
3464	
3465	PERICLES	Nay, I'll be patient.
3466	Thou little know'st how thou dost startle me,
3467	To call thyself Marina.
3468	
3469	MARINA	The name
3470	Was given me by one that had some power,
3471	My father, and a king.
3472	
3473	PERICLES	How! a king's daughter?
3474	And call'd Marina?
3475	
3476	MARINA	                  You said you would believe me;
3477	But, not to be a troubler of your peace,
3478	I will end here.
3479	
3480	PERICLES	                  But are you flesh and blood?
3481	Have you a working pulse? and are no fairy?
3482	Motion! Well; speak on. Where were you born?
3483	And wherefore call'd Marina?
3484	
3485	MARINA	Call'd Marina
3486	For I was born at sea.
3487	
3488	PERICLES	At sea! what mother?
3489	
3490	MARINA	My mother was the daughter of a king;
3491	Who died the minute I was born,
3492	As my good nurse Lychorida hath oft
3493	Deliver'd weeping.
3494	
3495	PERICLES	                  O, stop there a little!
3496	
3497	[Aside]
3498	
3499	This is the rarest dream that e'er dull sleep
3500	Did mock sad fools withal: this cannot be:
3501	My daughter's buried. Well: where were you bred?
3502	I'll hear you more, to the bottom of your story,
3503	And never interrupt you.
3504	
3505	MARINA	You scorn: believe me, 'twere best I did give o'er.
3506	
3507	PERICLES	I will believe you by the syllable
3508	Of what you shall deliver. Yet, give me leave:
3509	How came you in these parts? where were you bred?
3510	
3511	MARINA	The king my father did in Tarsus leave me;
3512	Till cruel Cleon, with his wicked wife,
3513	Did seek to murder me: and having woo'd
3514	A villain to attempt it, who having drawn to do't,
3515	A crew of pirates came and rescued me;
3516	Brought me to Mytilene. But, good sir,
3517	Whither will you have me? Why do you weep?
3518	It may be,
3519	You think me an impostor: no, good faith;
3520	I am the daughter to King Pericles,
3521	If good King Pericles be.
3522	
3523	PERICLES	Ho, Helicanus!
3524	
3525	HELICANUS	Calls my lord?
3526	
3527	PERICLES	Thou art a grave and noble counsellor,
3528	Most wise in general: tell me, if thou canst,
3529	What this maid is, or what is like to be,
3530	That thus hath made me weep?
3531	
3532	HELICANUS	I know not; but
3533	Here is the regent, sir, of Mytilene
3534	Speaks nobly of her.
3535	
3536	LYSIMACHUS	She would never tell
3537	Her parentage; being demanded that,
3538	She would sit still and weep.
3539	
3540	PERICLES	O Helicanus, strike me, honour'd sir;
3541	Give me a gash, put me to present pain;
3542	Lest this great sea of joys rushing upon me
3543	O'erbear the shores of my mortality,
3544	And drown me with their sweetness. O, come hither,
3545	Thou that beget'st him that did thee beget;
3546	Thou that wast born at sea, buried at Tarsus,
3547	And found at sea again! O Helicanus,
3548	Down on thy knees, thank the holy gods as loud
3549	As thunder threatens us: this is Marina.
3550	What was thy mother's name? tell me but that,
3551	For truth can never be confirm'd enough,
3552	Though doubts did ever sleep.
3553	
3554	MARINA	First, sir, I pray,
3555	What is your title?
3556	
3557	PERICLES	I am Pericles of Tyre: but tell me now
3558	My drown'd queen's name, as in the rest you said
3559	Thou hast been godlike perfect,
3560	The heir of kingdoms and another like
3561	To Pericles thy father.
3562	
3563	MARINA	Is it no more to be your daughter than
3564	To say my mother's name was Thaisa?
3565	Thaisa was my mother, who did end
3566	The minute I began.
3567	
3568	PERICLES	Now, blessing on thee! rise; thou art my child.
3569	Give me fresh garments. Mine own, Helicanus;
3570	She is not dead at Tarsus, as she should have been,
3571	By savage Cleon: she shall tell thee all;
3572	When thou shalt kneel, and justify in knowledge
3573	She is thy very princess. Who is this?
3574	
3575	HELICANUS	Sir, 'tis the governor of Mytilene,
3576	Who, hearing of your melancholy state,
3577	Did come to see you.
3578	
3579	PERICLES	I embrace you.
3580	Give me my robes. I am wild in my beholding.
3581	O heavens bless my girl! But, hark, what music?
3582	Tell Helicanus, my Marina, tell him
3583	O'er, point by point, for yet he seems to doubt,
3584	How sure you are my daughter. But, what music?
3585	
3586	HELICANUS	My lord, I hear none.
3587	
3588	PERICLES	None!
3589	The music of the spheres! List, my Marina.
3590	
3591	LYSIMACHUS	It is not good to cross him; give him way.
3592	
3593	PERICLES	Rarest sounds! Do ye not hear?
3594	
3595	LYSIMACHUS	My lord, I hear.
3596	
3597	[Music]
3598	
3599	PERICLES	Most heavenly music!
3600	It nips me unto listening, and thick slumber
3601	Hangs upon mine eyes: let me rest.
3602	
3603	[Sleeps]
3604	
3605	LYSIMACHUS	A pillow for his head:
3606	So, leave him all. Well, my companion friends,
3607	If this but answer to my just belief,
3608	I'll well remember you.
3609	
3610	[Exeunt all but PERICLES]
3611

3615	And do upon mine altar sacrifice.
3616	There, when my maiden priests are met together,
3617	Before the people all,
3618	Reveal how thou at sea didst lose thy wife:
3619	To mourn thy crosses, with thy daughter's, call
3620	And give them repetition to the life.
3621	Or perform my bidding, or thou livest in woe;
3622	Do it, and happy; by my silver bow!
3623	Awake, and tell thy dream.
3624

3633	
3634	PERICLES	My purpose was for Tarsus, there to strike
3635	The inhospitable Cleon; but I am
3636	For other service first: toward Ephesus
3637	Turn our blown sails; eftsoons I'll tell thee why.
3638	
3639	[To LYSIMACHUS]
3640	
3641	Shall we refresh us, sir, upon your shore,
3642	And give you gold for such provision
3643	As our intents will need?
3644	
3645	LYSIMACHUS	Sir,
3646	With all my heart; and, when you come ashore,
3647	I have another suit.
3648	
3649	PERICLES	You shall prevail,
3650	Were it to woo my daughter; for it seems
3651	You have been noble towards her.
3652

3674	GOWER	Now our sands are almost run;
3675	More a little, and then dumb.
3676	This, my last boon, give me,
3677	For such kindness must relieve me,
3678	That you aptly will suppose
3679	What pageantry, what feats, what shows,
3680	What minstrelsy, and pretty din,
3681	The regent made in Mytilene
3682	To greet the king. So he thrived,
3683	That he is promised to be wived
3684	To fair Marina; but in no wise
3685	Till he had done his sacrifice,
3686	As Dian bade: whereto being bound,

3703	ACT V
3704	
3705	
3706	SCENE III	The temple of Diana at Ephesus; THAISA standing
3707	near the altar, as high priestess; a number of
3708	Virgins on each side; CERIMON and other Inhabitants
3709	of Ephesus attending.
3710	
3711	
3712	[Enter PERICLES, with his train; LYSIMACHUS,
3713	HELICANUS, MARINA, and a Lady]
3714	
3715	PERICLES	Hail, Dian! to perform thy just command,
3716	I here confess myself the king of Tyre;
3717	Who, frighted from my country, did wed
3718	At Pentapolis the fair Thaisa.
3719	At sea in childbed died she, but brought forth
3720	A maid-child call'd Marina; who, O goddess,
3721	Wears yet thy silver livery. She at Tarsus
3722	Was nursed with Cleon; who at fourteen years
3723	He sought to murder: but her better stars
3724	Brought her to Mytilene; 'gainst whose shore
3725	Riding, her fortunes brought the maid aboard us,
3726	Where, by her own most clear remembrance, she
3727	Made known herself my daughter.
3728	
3729	THAISA	Voice and favour!
3730	You are, you are--O royal Pericles!
3731	
3732	[Faints]
3733	
3734	PERICLES	What means the nun? she dies! help, gentlemen!
3735	
3736	CERIMON	Noble sir,
3737	If you have told Diana's altar true,
3738	This is your wife.
3739	
3740	PERICLES	                  Reverend appearer, no;
3741	I threw her overboard with these very arms.
3742	
3743	CERIMON	Upon this coast, I warrant you.
3744	
3745	PERICLES	'Tis most certain.
3746	
3747	CERIMON	Look to the lady; O, she's but o'erjoy'd.
3748	Early in blustering morn this lady was
3749	Thrown upon this shore. I oped the coffin,
3750	Found there rich jewels; recover'd her, and placed her
3751	Here in Diana's temple.
3752	
3753	PERICLES	May we see them?
3754	
3755	CERIMON	Great sir, they shall be brought you to my house,
3756	Whither I invite you. Look, Thaisa is recovered.
3757	
3758	THAISA	O, let me look!
3759	If he be none of mine, my sanctity
3760	Will to my sense bend no licentious ear,
3761	But curb it, spite of seeing. O, my lord,
3762	Are you not Pericles? Like him you spake,
3763	Like him you are: did you not name a tempest,
3764	A birth, and death?
3765	
3766	PERICLES	The voice of dead Thaisa!
3767	
3768	THAISA	That Thaisa am I, supposed dead
3769	And drown'd.
3770	
3771	PERICLES	Immortal Dian!
3772	
3773	THAISA	                  Now I know you better.
3774	When we with tears parted Pentapolis,
3775	The king my father gave you such a ring.
3776	
3777	[Shows a ring]
3778	
3779	PERICLES	This, this: no more, you gods! your present kindness
3780	Makes my past miseries sports: you shall do well,
3781	That on the touching of her lips I may
3782	Melt and no more be seen. O, come, be buried
3783	A second time within these arms.
3784	
3785	MARINA	My heart
3786	Leaps to be gone into my mother's bosom.
3787	
3788	[Kneels to THAISA]
3789	
3790	PERICLES	Look, who kneels here! Flesh of thy flesh, Thaisa;

3792	For she was yielded there.

3798	THAISA	I know you not.
3799	
3800	PERICLES	You have heard me say, when I did fly from Tyre,
3801	I left behind an ancient substitute:
3802	Can you remember what I call'd the man?
3803	I have named him oft.
3804	
3805	THAISA	'Twas Helicanus then.
3806	
3807	PERICLES	Still confirmation:
3808	Embrace him, dear Thaisa; this is he.
3809	Now do I long to hear how you were found;
3810	How possibly preserved; and who to thank,
3811	Besides the gods, for this great miracle.
3812	
3813	THAISA	Lord Cerimon, my lord; this man,
3814	Through whom the gods have shown their power; that can
3815	From first to last resolve you.
3816	
3817	PERICLES	Reverend sir,
3818	The gods can have no mortal officer
3819	More like a god than you. Will you deliver
3820	How this dead queen re-lives?
3821	
3822	CERIMON	I will, my lord.
3823	Beseech you, first go with me to my house,
3824	Where shall be shown you all was found with her;
3825	How she came placed here in the temple;
3826	No needful thing omitted.
3827	
3828	PERICLES	Pure Dian, bless thee for thy vision! I
3829	Will offer night-oblations to thee. Thaisa,
3830	This prince, the fair-betrothed of your daughter,
3831	Shall marry her at Pentapolis. And now,
3832	This ornament
3833	Makes me look dismal will I clip to form;
3834	And what this fourteen years no razor touch'd,
3835	To grace thy marriage-day, I'll beautify.
3836	
3837	THAISA	Lord Cerimon hath letters of good credit, sir,
3838	My father's dead.
3839	
3840	PERICLES	Heavens make a star of him! Yet there, my queen,
3841	We'll celebrate their nuptials, and ourselves
3842	Will in that kingdom spend our following days:
3843	Our son and daughter shall in Tyrus reign.
3844	Lord Cerimon, we do our longing stay
3845	To hear the rest untold: sir, lead's the way.
3846	
3847	[Exeunt]
3848	
3849	[Enter GOWER]
3850	
3851	GOWER	In Antiochus and his daughter you have heard
3852	Of monstrous lust the due and just reward:
3853	In Pericles, his queen and daughter, seen,
3854	Although assail'd with fortune fierce and keen,
3855	Virtue preserved from fell destruction's blast,
3856	Led on by heaven, and crown'd with joy at last:
3857	In Helicanus may you well descry
3858	A figure of truth, of faith, of loyalty:
3859	In reverend Cerimon there well appears
3860	The worth that learned charity aye wears:
3861	For wicked Cleon and his wife, when fame
3862	Had spread their cursed deed, and honour'd name
3863	Of Pericles, to rage the city turn,
3864	That him and his they in his palace burn;
3865	The gods for murder seemed so content
3866	To punish them; although not done, but meant.
3867	So, on your patience evermore attending,
3868	New joy wait on you! Here our play has ending.
3869	
3870	[Exit]
